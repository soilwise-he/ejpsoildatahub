  abstract: "Climate change will affect Arctic ecosystems more than any other ecosystem\
    \ worldwide, with temperature increases expected up to 4-6\xB0C. While this is\
    \ threatening the integrity and biodiversity of the ecosystems in itself, the\
    \ larger ecosystem feedbacks triggered by this change are even more worrisome.\
    \ During millions of years, atmospheric carbon has been stored in the Arctic soils.\
    \ With warming, the carbon can rapidly escape the soils in the form of CO2 and\
    \ (even worse) the strong greenhouse agent CH4.Despite decades of research, scientists\
    \ still struggle to unveil the scale of this carbon exchange, and especially how\
    \ it will interact with climate change. An overarching question remains; how much\
    \ carbon will potentially escape the Arctic in the future climate, and how will\
    \ this affect climate change? FutureArctic embeds this research challenge directly\
    \ in an inter-sectoral training initiative for early stage researchers, that aims\
    \ to form \u201Cecosystem-of-things\u201D scientists and engineers at the ForHot\
    \ site. The FORHOT site in Iceland offers a geothermally controlled soil temperature\
    \ warming gradient, to study how Arctic ecosystem processes are affected by temperature\
    \ increases as expected through climate change. FutureArctic aims to pave the\
    \ way for generalized permanently connected data acquisition systems for key environmental\
    \ variables and processes. We will initiate a new machine-learning approach to\
    \ analyse large high-throughput environmental data-streams, through installing\
    \ a pioneer ecosystem-of-things at the ForHot site.FutureArctic will thus channel,\
    \ building on a timely project in the ForHot area, an important evolution to machine-assisted\
    \ environmental fundamental research. This is achieved through the dedicated training\
    \ of researchers with profiles at the inter-sectoral edge of computer science,\
    \ artificial intelligence, environmental science (both experimental and modelling),\
    \ scoial sciences  and sensor engineering and communication.\n"
