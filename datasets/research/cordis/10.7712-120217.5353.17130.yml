  title: RELIABILITY PREDICTION OF FATIGUE DAMAGE ACCUMULATION ON WIND TURBINES SUPPORT
    STRUCTURES
  abstract: "The excessive energy consumption that Europe is faced with, calls for\
    \ sustainable resource management and policy-making. Amongst renewable sources\
    \ of the global energy pool, wind energy holds the lead. Nonetheless, wind turbine\
    \ (WT) facilities are conjoined with a number of shortcomings relating to their\
    \ short life-span and the lack of efficient management schemes. With a number\
    \ of WTs currently reaching their design span, stakeholders and policy makers\
    \ are convinced of the necessity for reliable life-cycle assessment methodologies.\
    \ However, existing tools have not yet caught up with the maturity of the WT technology,\
    \ leaving visual inspection and offline non-destructive evaluation methods as\
    \ the norm.This proposal aims to establish a smart framework for the monitoring,\
    \ inspection and life-cycle assessment of WTs, able to guide WT operators in the\
    \ management of these assets from cradle-to-grave. Our project is founded on a\
    \ minimal intervention principle, coupling easily deployed and affordable sensor\
    \ technology with state-of-the-art numerical modeling and data processing tools.\
    \ An integrated approach is proposed comprising; (i) a new monitoring paradigm\
    \ for WTs relying on fusion of structural response information, (ii) simulation\
    \ of influential, yet little explored, factors affecting structural response,\
    \ such as structure-foundation-soil interaction and fatigue (ii) a stochastic\
    \ framework for detecting anomalies in both a short- (damage) and long-term (deterioration)\
    \ scale.Our end goal is to deliver a \u201Cprotection-suit\u201D for WTs comprising\
    \ a hardware (sensor) solution and a modular readily implementable software package,\
    \ titled ETH-WINDMIL. The suggested kit aims to completely redefine the status\
    \ quo in current Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition systems. This pursuit\
    \ is well founded on background work of the PI within the area of structural monitoring,\
    \ with a focus in translating the value of information into quantifiable terms\
    \ and engineering practice.\n"
