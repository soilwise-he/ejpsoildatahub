  title: Assessing mid-latitude dynamics in extreme event attribution systems
  abstract: "A large part of our knowledge on climate change is provided by the usage\
    \ of coupled atmospheric-ocean Global Climate Models (GCMs), which produce numerical\
    \ simulations of the Earth\u2019s climate system for both the present and the\
    \ future. However, state-of-the-art GCMs show considerable systematic errors;\
    \ they are limited by low spatial resolutions and by the problematic representation\
    \ of many physical processes. In particular, one of the largest sources of uncertainty\
    \ is associated with the coupling between the atmospheric circulation and the\
    \ water cycle.COGNAC is conceived as a fundamental theoretical project framed\
    \ in this context. It aims at readdressing the representation of moist convection,\
    \ clouds and precipitation and their interaction with the surface and the soil\
    \ in GCMs. A recently developed theoretical framework capable of treating in a\
    \ unified way the soil, the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), clouds, and both shallow\
    \ and deep convection will be used. Such model - the Probabilistic Plume Model,\
    \ PPM - is capable to represent the whole atmospheric column (from the PBL to\
    \ the tropopause) with results comparable to Large Eddies Simulations and with\
    \ a minor numerical cost. COGNAC aims at improving and refining the PPM and integrating\
    \ it into two models, the LMDz GCM and the EC-Earth GCM, in the form a new unified\
    \ parameterization. First evaluation will be carried out on Single Column Models,\
    \ and hence extended to the full 3D case. Once operational, these new GCM configurations\
    \ will provide a powerful tool to study complex interactions among surface, PBL\
    \ and moist convection, as the ones occurring in the Sahel, the Amazon Rainforest\
    \ or the Mediterranean region. These advancements will have notable potential\
    \ for improving the representation, the forecast and the evaluation of the future\
    \ changes of large-impact hydro-meteorological events.\n"
