  title: 'Experimentally testing the species-habitat size relationship on soil bacteria:
    A proof of concept'
  abstract: 'Despite the importance of soil microbial communities for ecosystem functioning
    and human welfare, little is known about the mechanisms controlling the composition
    and diversity of these communities, and the role of their attributes in providing
    multiple ecosystem functions and services such as nutrient cycling and decomposition
    (i.e. multifunctionality). Many studies have identified climate, stage of ecosystem
    development and soil characteristics as main drivers of plant and animal diversity.
    However, much less is known about the interactive effects of climate, soil properties
    and time in controlling microbial diversity and multifunctionality during ecosystem
    succession. This lack of knowledge hampers our ability to predict microbial community
    shifts and their consequences for ecosystem functioning under climate change,
    and limits the inclusion of soil microbes in global biogeochemical models. The
    main research objective of this action is to gain a deeper insight into the patterns
    and mechanisms that drive soil microbial diversity and multifunctionality under
    changing environments. We will use a novel conceptual framework combining long-term
    chronosequences, climate change experiments and structural equation modelling
    to quantitatively evaluate the role of time, climate and multiple soil drivers
    in controlling microbial diversity and multifunctionality. The research outlined
    in this proposal includes a range of state-of-the-art biochemical, molecular and
    genomic methods for the analysis of microbial communities and multifunctionality
    that ensure the maximum utility and impact of our results. Altogether, CLIMIFUN
    will reveal the factors that control soil microbial diversity and multiple functions
    linked to plant production and nutrient cycling under a changing environment.
    This work will thus address a key knowledge gap relevant to supporting increases
    in global demand for food and fibre over the next decades, and a research priority
    for H2020.
