  title: "Effects of particle sphericity and initial fabric on the shearing behavior\
    \ of soil\u2013rough structural interface"
  abstract: 'HERCULES brings together a multidisciplinary team crossing boundaries
    within technology, systems thinking and society to develop a step change in the
    understanding and monitoring capabilities of geohazards and in turn produce ground
    breaking new methods to boost the resilience of current infrastructure under changing
    climates. The programme will undertake fundamental research to ascertain the pathways
    and grow our capacity to assess and predict risks due to geohazards. The proposed
    study will employ a range of novel research approaches across multiple scales,
    from the macro-scale through to the micro scale including the integration of Earth
    Observation techniques, laboratory investigation and by investigating the ground
    behaviour at the scale of soil particles experimentally using tomography and numerical
    techniques such as the Discrete Element Method. Our approach is unique in that
    the design and implementation of the technology is informed not only through the
    combination of laboratory and field studies, data interpretation and numerical
    simulations, but also coproduced through consultation with the local community.
    We will use crowdsourced geographic information with real-time environmental data
    and models to provide a decision-making framework to be adapted to local needs
    for the monitoring and early-warning of geozahards to improve urban resilience.    The
    goals of the project are to; i) exchange knowledge in a multidisciplinary environment
    between academia and industry; ii) develop new insights, approaches and technologies
    that support the needs of end-users to make both the built environment and infrastructure
    more resilient to the increasing threat of natural hazards due to the effect of
    a more variable climate; iii) train Early Stage Researches (ESRs) during their
    secondments between Institutions who will form the next generation of researchers
    leading  academic and industrial technological developments in this field.
