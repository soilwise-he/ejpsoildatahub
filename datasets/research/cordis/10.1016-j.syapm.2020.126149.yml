  title: Genetic diversity and phylogeny of indigenous rhizobia nodulating faba bean
    (Vicia faba L.) in Greece
  abstract: 'Tomato is a main EU agricultural commodity, cultivated all over Europe
    in open and protected field and in glasshouses, representing a biological and
    agronomical model crop. Combined water and nutrient stress is a major problem
    for tomato farmers and solutions are needed to safeguard yields, while preserving
    the environment.TOMRES will select, among over 10,000 available accessions, rootstocks
    and scions tolerating combined stress, while retaining fruit quality and yield,
    taking advantage of innovative screening approaches. Novel traits, in particular
    belowground, to be exploited in breeding, will be identified. The role of selected
    hormones (strigolactones and brassinosteroids) will be studied to identify further
    resilience traits. TOMRES will test and optimize sustainable crop management strategies
    such as legume intercropping, precision fertilization and irrigation techniques,
    manipulation of symbiotic microorganisms, and the use of rootstocks more suited
    to water and nutrient uptake from the soil. Novel genotypes X management strategies
    will be developed with the goal of reducing N and P application by at least 20%,
    water input by 40%, while granting environmental sustainability and economic viability
    of the solutions proposed.Testing will be integrated with analysis of environmental
    (greenhouse emissions, water quality), and of socio-economic impact. Agronomical,
    environmental, and economical data will be processed to construction of models
    and of a Decision Support System. Demonstration and dissemination activities will
    follow the whole course of the project, and will transfer the results to different
    environments and other cropping systems, thus ensuring the widest impact of the
    gained knowledge on the EU economy. Trans-disciplinary knowledge transfer among
    farmers, breeders, industries, associations and scientists will be granted by
    a solid multi-actor approach since the planning stage.
