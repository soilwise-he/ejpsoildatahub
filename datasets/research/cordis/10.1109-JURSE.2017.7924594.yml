  title: Spatial distribution of sensible and latent heat flux in the URBANFLUXES
    case study city Basel (Switzerland)
  abstract: 'The main goal of the proposed project URBANFLUXES (URBan ANthrpogenic
    heat FLUX from Earth observation Satellites) is to investigate the potential of
    Earth Observation (EO) to retrieve anthropogenic heat fluxes. The main research
    question addresses whether EO is able to provide reliable estimates of anthropogenic
    heat flux spatiotemporal distribution, at local and city scales. URBANFLUXES will
    investigate the potential of EO to retrieve the anthropogenic heat flux, as a
    key component in the urban energy budget and by developing a method capable of
    deriving it from space. The objective is to develop a method that could be used
    operationally in the near future, when observations with adequate temporal resolution
    become available. URBANFLUXES EO-based approach will be easily transferable to
    any urban area and capable of providing anthropogenic heat flux benchmark data
    for different applications, including climate models to assess the implication
    of the anthropogenic heat on the Earth system; building energy models to characterize
    buildings-to-atmosphere/soil/water heat exchange pathways; and decision support
    systems for urban sustainable planning and mapping of emissions related to energy
    consumption. URBANFLUXES is therefore expected to prepare the ground for further
    innovative exploitation of European space data in scientific activities (Earth
    system modelling and climate change studies in cities) and future and emerging
    applications (sustainable urban planning) by exploiting the improved data quality,
    coverage and revisit times of the Copernicus Sentinels data. The Copernicus observations
    have the potential to reveal novel scientific insights, related to monitoring
    the anthropogenic heat flux in cities, at both local and regional scales, generating
    new EO opportunities. The URBANFLUXES products will therefore support both sustainable
    planning strategies to improve the quality of life in cities and Earth system
    models to provide more robust climate simulations.
