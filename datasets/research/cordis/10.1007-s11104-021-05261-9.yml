  title: 'Tracing hotspots of soil erosion in high mountain environments: how forensic
    science based on plant eDNA can lead the way.  An opinion'
  abstract: 'Mountains in Europe are highly valued as they provide diverse living
    and recreational opportunities and unique landscape sceneries, are key economic
    assets, and because they are treasures of unique flora and fauna. Their vulnerable
    environment is, however, threatened by the frequent occurrence of shallow landslides
    and water erosion which produce large amounts of sediment during floods. The urgency
    to mitigate natural hazards calls for an improved understanding of how physical
    and biological dimensions of ecological restoration interact. Hence, the ECO-MOUNTAIN
    project proses an environmental connectivity framework as the keystone to the
    ecological restoration degraded mountains. A study area was selected in the Pyrenees,
    where I will benefit from the support of local stakeholders engaged the restoring
    degraded mountain slopes. Special focus is given to developing a novel sediment
    source fingerprinting method using environmental DNA (eDNA). As strong interrelations
    exist between vegetation, soils and geomorphology, plants leave an eDNA signature
    on sediments which reflects the degradation status of the area. It will allow
    to define erosion hotspots at unprecedented precisions and serve as a tool to
    monitor the impact of ecological restoration schemes in large catchments. The
    validity of the novel eDNA fingerprint methods will be evaluated against conventional
    fingerprinting method (carbon/nitrogen) and soil mineralogy. I will be hosted
    by Dr. Stokes at the AMAP joint research group in Montpellier (France). Having
    access to excellent training and laboratory facilities at AMAP, I will be able
    to grow as a multiskilled soil restoration scientist. Guidance will also be given
    by Prof. Cammeraat (geomorphologist) and Dr. Evrard (geochemist) and they will
    host me in their state-of-the art laboratories during short research stays. From
    this fellowship project, I expect to grow as an independent scientist and reap
    the rewards for years to come in my future career.
