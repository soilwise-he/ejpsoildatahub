  title: Disentangling Drought and Nutrient Effects on Soil Carbon Dioxide and Methane
    Fluxes in a Tropical Forest
  abstract: 'RainForest-GHG aims to quantify ecosystem sinks and emissions of three
    major greenhouse gases (GHGs), i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous
    oxide (N2O), in a tropical rainforest, and examine the contributions of the soil
    and the woody tissues to the ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes. RainForest-GHG further
    aims to determine the main environmental drivers responsible for the temporal
    and spatial variations of these GHG fluxes.
