  title: Evaluation of anti-soiling coatings for CSP reflectors under realistic outdoor
    conditions
  abstract: "RAISELIFE focuses on extending the in-service lifetime of five key materials\
    \ for concentrated solar power technologies; 1) protective and anti-soiling coatings\
    \ of primary reflectors, 2) high-reflective surfaces for heliostats, 3) high-temperature\
    \ secondary reflectors, 4) receiver coatings for solar towers and line-focus collectors,\
    \ 5) corrosion resistant high-temperature metals and coatings for steam and molten\
    \ salts.The project brings together a broad consortium formed of industry partners,\
    \ SMEs and research institutes of the concentrating solar thermal and material\
    \ science sector. The scope has been significantly shaped by the leading EPC of\
    \ solar tower technology, BrightSource, who constructed Ivanpah, the world\u2019\
    s largest solar tower plant. This unique constellation permits a direct transfer\
    \ of the obtained results in RAISELIFE into new commercial solar thermal power\
    \ plant projects within less than 5 years and helps to solve urgent matters of\
    \ current commercial power plants (e.g. the high temperature oxidation of absorber\
    \ coatings on metallic tower receivers). For this purpose several TRL6 functional\
    \ materials are being tested in accelerated climate chamber tests, field-tests\
    \ under elevated solar flux and in-service in BSIIs power plants, with the final\
    \ goal of increasing durability and performance and in consequence reducing CAPEX\
    \ and OPEX. We project that commercial implementation of the subject technologies\
    \ could account for as much as 2.5-3 euro-cent Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)\
    \ reduction per kWh of electricity produced for solar tower technology between\
    \ 2015 and 2020.\n"
