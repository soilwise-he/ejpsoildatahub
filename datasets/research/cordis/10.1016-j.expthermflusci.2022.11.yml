  title: Characterization of jet parameters related to cavitation bubble dynamics
    in a vicinity of a flat liquid-liquid interface
  abstract: 'A sudden decrease in pressure triggers the formation of vapour and gas
    bubbles inside a liquid medium (also called cavitation). This leads to many (key)
    engineering problems; material loss, noise and vibration of hydraulic machinery.
    On the other hand, cavitation is a potentially a useful phenomenon; the extreme
    conditions are increasingly used for a wide variety of applications such as surface
    cleaning, enhanced chemistry, and waste water treatment (bacteria eradication
    and virus inactivation).Despite this significant progress a large gap persists
    between the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the effects of
    cavitation and its application. Although engineers are already commercializing
    devices that employ cavitation, we are still not able to answer the fundamental
    question; What precisely are the mechanisms how bubbles can clean, disinfect,
    kill bacteria and enhance chemical activity? The overall objective of the project
    is to understand and determine the fundamental physics of the interaction of cavitation
    bubbles with different contaminants. To address this issue, the CABUM project
    will investigate the physical background of cavitation from physical, biological
    and engineering perspective on three complexity scales; i) on single bubble level,
    ii) on organised and iii) on random bubble clusters, producing a progressive multidisciplinary
    synergetic effect.The proposed synergetic approach builds on the PI''s preliminary
    research and employs novel experimental and numerical methodologies, some of which
    have been developed by the PI and his research group, to explore the physics of
    cavitation behaviour in interaction with bacteria and viruses.Understanding the
    fundamental physical background of cavitation in interaction with contaminants
    will have a ground-breaking implications in various scientific fields (engineering,
    chemistry and biology) and will, in the future, enable the exploitation of cavitation
    in water and soil treatment processes.
