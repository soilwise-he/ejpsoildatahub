  title: Ecosystem Carbon Stocks and Their Annual Sequestration Rate in Mature Forest
    Stands on the Mineral Soils of Estonia.
  abstract: "Forest ecosystems cover 42 % of the European Union\u2019s total land\
    \ area and strong efforts have been made to facilitate an increase of multiple\
    \ forest ecosystem services to form robust forest stands. However, all ecosystems\
    \ recently have been hit by rapidly changing climatic conditions, e.g. long lasting\
    \ droughts, heavy rain events, frequent and intensive storms, pests and forest\
    \ fires. To address this within future silviculture management concepts, forest\
    \ operations and wood supply, all stakeholders along the Forest Wood Value Chain\
    \ will need to form a common idea of future forest management, while none of them\
    \ can increase its benefit without harming another one. Therefore, four Case Studies\
    \ Regions will be established, following Europe\u2019s biogeographical regions,\
    \ to study climate-resilient silvicultural management practices and new methods\
    \ of seeding and planting by the application of an own engineered topsoil cover\
    \ based on wood fibres. Corresponding forest operations and concepts of actions\
    \ in case of disturbances will be developed under selected sustainability criteria.\
    \ Stakeholders will be activated in the participative process of socio-economic\
    \ studies. The information will be consolidated in Dynamic Value Chain Model to\
    \ assess the impact of the Forest-Wood Value Chain on regional development quantified\
    \ by a set of economic, environmental and social indicators. The newly developed\
    \ Multi-Criteria Decision Support System visualises decision-making by comparing\
    \ Sustainable Forest Management, synergies and trade-offs of Forest Ecosystems,\
    \ reliable wood supply, and stakeholder interests through FWVC indicators of social,\
    \ economic, and environmental dimensions, by applying methods of Goal Programming.\
    \ The easy-to-use software application will be available for Forest-Wood Value\
    \ Chain stakeholders globally. All ONEforest results will be implemented in new\
    \ Model Forests, being part of the International Model Forest Network for regional\
    \ adapted forest management concept.\n"
