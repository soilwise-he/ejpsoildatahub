  abstract: 'This proposal aims to provide a step change in terms of our capacity
    to assess and predict risks due to geohazards (landslides and rock slides, earthquakes,
    floods).  This is necessary in order to make built environments and infrastructures
    resilient to the increasing threat of natural hazards due to the expanding size
    of European cities and urban centres, increased use of infrastructure, and the
    effect of increased climatic variations. To achieve this we will bring together
    the complementary expertise of world leading academic groups in geotechnical,
    geoenvironmental and seismic engineering, soil and rock mechanics, seismology,
    hydrology, geology together with private engineering software companies.  The
    goals of this proposal are; i) to investigate the key physical-mechanical aspects
    of major geohazards (landslides, earthquakes, floods) with a multi-disciplinary
    approach in order to bridge the current gaps in knowledge and enable a step-change
    in the current capabilities of risk assessment, prevention, and mitigation; ii)
    to generate new approaches to predicting geohazards by creating an international,
    interdisciplinary and intersectoral group which will combine existing knowledge
    to generate new research methodologies and applications by enabling knowledge
    exchange among researchers with expertise in complementary research fields; iii)
    to train several Early Stage Researches (ESRs) during their stay at the host Institution
    who will form the next generation of researchers for academic and industrial applications;
    iv) to improve the current normative standards and codes ruling geohazard prevention;
    v) to provide a competitive edge to European engineering software companies modelling
    geohazards.
