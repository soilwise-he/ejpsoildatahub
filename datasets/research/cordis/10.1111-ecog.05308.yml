  title: "Evaluating predictive performance of statistical models explaining wild\
    \ bee abundance in a mass\u2010flowering crop"
  abstract: 'Pollinator declines in response to land-use intensification have raised
    concern about the persistence of plant species dependent on insect pollination,
    in particular by bees, for their reproduction. Recent empirical studies show that
    reduced pollinator abundance decreases densities of seedlings of insect-pollinated
    plants and thereby changes the composition of grassland plant communities. Cascading
    effects on ecosystem functioning and associated organisms are expected, but to
    which extent and under which conditions this is the case is yet unexplored. Here,
    I propose a bold, multi-year, landscape-scale experimental assessment of the extent
    of pollinator-driven plant community changes, their consequences for associated
    organisms and important ecosystem functions, and their likely contingency on other
    factors (soil fertility, herbivory).Specifically I will;(1) Set up a network of
    long-term research plots in landscapes differing in pollinator abundance to measure
    the changes in plant reproduction over successive years, and assessing experimentally
    how herbivory and soil fertility mediate these effects.(2) Explore the individual
    processes linking pollinators, plant communities and ecosystem functioning using
    long-term experiments controlling pollinator, herbivore and nutrient availability,
    focusing on a sample of plant species covering both the dominant species and a
    diversity of functional traits.(3) Assess the context-dependence of pollinator-mediated
    plant community determination by building and applying process-based models based
    on observational and experimental data, and combine with existing spatially-explicit
    pollinator models to demonstrate the applicability to assess agri-environmental
    measures.This powerful blend of complementary approaches will for the first time
    shed light on the cornerstone role of this major mutualism in maintaining diverse
    communities and the functions they support, and pinpoint the risks threatening
    them and the need for mitigation.
