  title: Soil Fungal:Bacterial Ratios Are Linked to Altered Carbon Cycling
  abstract: "The need for improved food production for the growing population has\
    \ led to increase in planet\u2019s arable land cover. Many studies suggest that\
    \ such practices lead to loss of soil organic carbon (C) \u2013 a relatively large\
    \ C pool with a fast response time. Thus there is a need to manage soils sustainably\
    \ in order to mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels while maintaining agricultural productivity.\
    \ Soil microorganisms act as gatekeepers for soil-atmosphere C exchange by regulating\
    \ the storage and release of organic C in soil. However, there is a lack of understanding\
    \ on how land use induced shifts in soil microbial diversity affects this regulation;\
    \ necessitating detailed research on the underpinning microbial mechanisms. The\
    \ project objective is to discern the effects of land use on microbial diversity\
    \ in differing soil types and to investigate whether this shift has implications\
    \ for C cycling (do certain microbial groups have a greater capacity for soil\
    \ C accumulation?). To address these objectives an interdisciplinary approach\
    \ merging molecular biology and isotope chemistry will be employed. Soil from\
    \ long-term grassland-arable paired sites will be used to assess differences in\
    \ microbial biodiversity and functional gene abundance through DNA next-generation\
    \ sequencing. In addition, a field incubation experiment with 13C labelled substrates\
    \ will be performed to investigate the variable tracer incorporation into different\
    \ microbial functional groups. This will be measured using novel magnetic bead\
    \ capture hybridization of RNA from specific groups followed by its 13C analysis\
    \ using liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The novelty of\
    \ this project is that it aims to provide direct evidence to prove diversity-function\
    \ linkages and gain mechanistic understanding of the physiological responses of\
    \ soil microbial communities to land use change. The resulting knowledge will\
    \ help better predict changes in soil C and thus improve prognosis of climate\
    \ change feedbacks.\n"
