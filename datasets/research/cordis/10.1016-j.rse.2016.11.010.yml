  title: 'Normalizing land surface temperature data for elevation and illumination
    effects in mountainous areas: A case study using ASTER data over a steep-sided
    valley in Morocco'
  abstract: 'Sustainable water use is a growing concern in Europe. Nowadays, agriculture
    is an important pressure on water resources especially in Mediterranean countries
    where irrigation can represent up to 80% of the consumptive uses of water. Increasing
    water use efficiency in agriculture has been thus identified as one of the key
    themes relating to water scarcity and drought (EEA Report No 1/2012). It now becomes
    necessary to improve on-farm irrigation management by adjusting irrigation to
    crop water requirements along the growing season.Modern irrigation agencies rely
    on in situ root zone soil moisture measurements to detect the onset of crop water
    stress and to trigger irrigation. However, in situ point measurements are generally
    not available over extended areas and may not be representative at the field scale.
    If remote sensing provides cost-effective techniques for monitoring broad areas,
    there is currently no algorithm dedicated to root zone soil moisture monitoring
    at the parcel scale.REC proposes a solution to the need of root-zone soil moisture
    at the crop scale for irrigation management. It is based on an innovative operational
    algorithm that will allow for the first time to; 1) to map root zone soil moisture
    on a daily basis at the field scale and 2) to quantitatively evaluate the different
    components of the water budget at the field scale from readily available remote
    sensing data.The methodology relies on the coupling between a surface model representing
    the water fluxes at the land surface atmosphere interface (infiltration, evaporation,
    transpiration) and in the soil (drainage), and remote sensing data composed of
    land surface temperature, and near-surface soil moisture retrieved from microwave
    radiometers and radars.These estimates will be integrated in an irrigation management
    system that will be used to trigger irrigation. In addition, these estimates will
    allow making an impact assessment of the consumptive use of water and water footprint.
