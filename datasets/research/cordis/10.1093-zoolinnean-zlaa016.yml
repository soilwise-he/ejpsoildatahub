    \ or a subgroup?"
  abstract: "Agriculture is facing enormous challenges today. Not only does it have\
    \ to provide enough safe and healthy food for the ever-increasing Earth\u2019\
    s population, it is also expected to offer alternatives to fossil fuels and to\
    \ protect the non-renewable resources such as soil, water and energy inputs. ANTARES\
    \ aims to evolve BioSense Institute from Serbia into a European Centre of Excellence\
    \ (CoE) for advanced technologies in sustainable agriculture, by implementing\
    \ a detailed business plan prepared during ANTARES Phase 1. This endeavor is supported\
    \ by the participation of the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological\
    \ Development who will provide both institutional and legislative support, as\
    \ well as by a strong commitment of the Republic of Serbia to provide co-financing\
    \ of 14 mil  . The participation of DLO from the Netherlands, the leading European\
    \ institute for applied and market-driven research in the agrifood sector will\
    \ secure that the know-how and experience of the highest European standards are\
    \ transplanted to Serbia. ANTARES builds upon the complementary expertise of BioSense\
    \ and DLO; the synergetic combination of ICT and agricultural knowledge will strengthen\
    \ the competitive positions of both institutions and provide answers to challenges\
    \ that go far beyond borders of any single country. ANTARES envisages a long-term\
    \ strategic cooperation between DLO and the new CoE, relies on a well-developed\
    \ joint strategic research agenda and on a documented financial analysis that\
    \ proves the long-term sustainability and growth of the new CoE beyond Teaming\
    \ funding. CoE\u2019s mission and vision are aligned with needs of European and\
    \ Serbian society and focus on science for impact and economic growth. ANTARES\
    \ is a smart investment, as it simultaneously helps an associated country to bridge\
    \ the gaps with Europe through research and innovation, while at the same time\
    \ contributes to safe and adequate food for future generations of Europeans.\n"
