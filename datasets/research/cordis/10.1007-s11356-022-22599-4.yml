  title: 'Physicochemical and biological ageing processes of (micro)plastics in the
    environment: a multi-tiered study on polyethylene'
  abstract: 'Plastic and microplastic pollution is a global environmental and societal
    concern. While focus has been placed on assessing the direct impacts on biota,
    indirect ecological effects are unexplored. Following very recent (and unexpected)
    laboratory evidences of a considerable binding between metals and altered plastics,
    I hypothesize that such an interaction can be amplified in environmental conditions
    due to mechanical, UV and biological degradations during plastic ageing. Plastic
    can change the budget and cycling of nutrients, micronutrients and toxic metals
    in different environments (agricultural soils, sediments). If this holds, the
    implications for the ecosystem might be far-reaching. The mechanisms underpinning
    ions/metals- plastic interaction are still mostly unexplored.Through PLANET action,
    I will; i) conduct artificial plastic ageing experiment on selected polymers to
    create testing materials for following work; ii) characterize the alterations
    of plastic surface physicochemical properties, iii) run sorption tests with ions
    and metals in batch experiments under varying pH, salinity, redox potential to
    disentangle mechanisms, nature and energy of this interaction; iv) build a mathematical
    frame describing this interaction and its implications for ions/metals distribution
    in the environment; v) assess model predictions in sediments/water column microcosms
    to enable inference for ecological effects at different scales.I will work at
    the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, a top research centre for plastic
    pollution analysis and environmental modelling. The host owns advanced equipment
    and laboratory to enable the project. The supervisor is committed to provide training
    on several core and soft skills and give access to his scientific and stakeholder
    networks. This will largely benefit my career development. I will exploit these
    contacts for communication and dissemination towards concrete impacts in the scientific,
    policy and industrial sector.
