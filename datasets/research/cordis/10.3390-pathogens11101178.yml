  title: 'The Fight against Plant-Parasitic Nematodes: Current Status of Bacterial
    and Fungal Biocontrol Agents'
  abstract: "Plants live in association with a plethora of microorganisms, which constitute\
    \ the plant microbiome. The management of this microbiome, boosting the presence\
    \ of functionally relevant bacterial taxa, will improve the plant growth and development\
    \ and enhance the yields of crops, which turns of paramount importance for feeding\
    \ a constantly increasing World population. The selection of a determinate agronomic\
    \ practice is also very important in order to maximize crop productivity. In this\
    \ sense, intercropping and crop rotation are two agronomic practices that are\
    \ quite common within the European Union and also, all over the world. The crops\
    \ used in these cropping systems are normally one legume, such as pea or clover,\
    \ and one cereal, such as barley or maize. The rationale of using a legume in\
    \ those cropping systems is to provide the soils and the subsequent crop with\
    \ a N source.There are numerous studies about individual crops\xB4 microbiota\
    \ as well as about bacterial isolates able to promote plant growth and performance.\
    \ Moreover, there are studies stating that bacterial strains are able to protect\
    \ the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses. However, there is a lack of studies\
    \ on the interaction between the different members of a microbiome within each\
    \ plant and the different microbiomes of the plants included in a given cropping\
    \ system.The main aim of this action is to determine the core microbiome and their\
    \ associated functions that are common between the crops in each cropping system.\
    \ This knowledge will allow to design an adapted biofertilizer based on a simplified\
    \ native community, which will improve crop fitness and productivity, as well\
    \ as protect against quarantine pathogens. This final goal will turn itself as\
    \ an effective tool for managing cropping systems such as crop rotation and intercropping\
    \ from a microbiological vision.\n"
