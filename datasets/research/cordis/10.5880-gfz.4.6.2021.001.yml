  title: Major element stream water chemistry, compiled 10Be erosion rates, and analyses
    of weathering across an erosion-rate gradient in in southern Taiwan.
  abstract: "Understanding Earth\u2019s climate system is a major aim of the H2020\
    \ work programme. The chemical weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals is\
    \ a key component of Earth\u2019s climate system by exchanging large volumes of\
    \ carbon between atmospheric and geologic reservoirs. Commonly, weathering models\
    \ focus on the steady production, chemical alteration, and erosion of regolith\
    \ and soil. However, the majority of fresh, weatherable sediment on Earth\u2019\
    s surface is produced in active mountain ranges where unsteady bedrock landsliding\
    \ is the dominant erosion process. There, existing weathering models do not apply.\
    \ The lack of data and models for chemical weathering in bedrock landslide deposits\
    \ presents a major knowledge gap that limits our predictions of weathering dynamics\
    \ and, ultimately, our understanding of Earth\u2019s climate system. \tThe goal\
    \ of WetSlide is to quantify the impact of landslide erosion on chemical weathering\
    \ fluxes from mountain ranges with three research objectives; 1) Assess millennial-scale\
    \ variations of weathering rates in landslide deposits with a unique dataset of\
    \ landslide-seepage-water chemistry from New Zealand; 2) Quantify erosion timescales\
    \ of landslide deposits by measuring and compiling deposit volumes of dated landslides;\
    \ 3) Develop and calibrate a model for weathering in landslides based on data\
    \ from 1-2. This model will be combined with a regolith weathering model to estimate\
    \ landscape-scale weathering fluxes. By providing the first quantitative study\
    \ of weathering in landslide deposits, WetSlide has the potential to re-define\
    \ the impact of mountain belt uplift on the inorganic carbon cycle and to drive\
    \ a step-change in the understanding of global chemical weathering dynamics. Moreover,\
    \ interdisciplinary training by experts at two world-leading research institutions\
    \ will shape a competitive young researcher with a rare combination of skills\
    \ who can effectively contribute to EU research excellence in integrative natural\
    \ sciences.\n"
