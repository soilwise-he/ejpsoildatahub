  title: 'Hydrothermal Carbonization of Digestate in the Presence of Zeolite: Process
    Efficiency and Composite Properties'
  abstract: "Aim of this project is to investigate and exploit the potentials of a\
    \ new material termed biochar-mineral complex (BMC). The simple yet ground-breaking\
    \ idea is to use common waste streams to produce BMCs with distinct properties.\
    \ Primary target is the use of BMCs as soil amender, especially in soils, where\
    \ the delicate but crucial structure of organo-mineral complexes is threatened\
    \ by unsustainable soil use or climate change. Where pure biochar is known to\
    \ face its limits, BMC because of its mineral part is assumed to enable much higher\
    \ functionality (i.e. water and nutrient storage). To provide evidence-based information\
    \ on production, properties and soil effects of BMC, a systematic study will be\
    \ conducted. The highly interdisciplinary work is split into five strongly interconnected\
    \ work packages, which cover the whole BMC lifespan from production to soil use\
    \ and technology assessment. Most of the work will be conducted at the University\
    \ of Edinburgh (UoE). A secondment is planned at Enrich Environmental Ltd., an\
    \ innovative Irish waste treatment SME, where the potentials and requirements\
    \ for successful large-scale implementation will be investigated. Introducing\
    \ this original work to the scientific communities (i.e. waste, agriculture, soil,\
    \ material science) is expected to make enormous impact. Strong attention is also\
    \ paid to dissemination of the results to the industry, other stakeholders and\
    \ the general public. The ER, in addition to the expected excellent research,\
    \ profits greatly from new experiences with pyrolysis (UKBRC) and business management\
    \ (Enrich) supporting his strive for an academic career as professor. The UoE\
    \ benefits from the ER\u2019s experiences in hydrothermal carbonization and gaining\
    \ competence in BMCs. Enrich, in return, has strong interest to expand its range\
    \ of products and to integrate innovative processes such as BMC production. Naturally,\
    \ the ER, UoE and Enrich are strongly committed to the planed action and a most\
    \ successful outcome.\n"
