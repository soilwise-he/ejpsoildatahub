  title: 'The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the pantropical earthworm Pontoscolex
    corethrurus (Rhinodrilidae, Clitellata): Mitogenome characterization and phylogenetic
    positioning'
  abstract: "The anthropologic and archaeological study of pre-Columbian people of\
    \ the Amazonian basin has revealed sophisticated agriculture practices. Notwithstanding\
    \ the absence of historical written records the biological evidence of these practices\
    \ remains in the remarkable biodiversity of the Amazonian 'dark earths' (ADEs)\
    \ or \u201CTerra Preta do Indio\u201D produced by ancient civilisations to promote\
    \ highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Promoting the interdisciplinary\
    \ connection between anthropology, soil ecology and genomics the applicant will\
    \ be able to investigate both the relationship of ADEs to the associated extant\
    \ biodiversity, reveal details of past and current anthropogenic impact on the\
    \ natural surroundings, as well as new clues regarding settlement dynamics over\
    \ a large part of Brazil. The applicant and the supporting team will accomplish\
    \ this by;a) Assessing  the current soil biodiversity assemblages to gain knowledge\
    \ about the functioning and potential role of soil ecosystem engineers, organic\
    \ matter and nutrients to the formation of these extremely fertile soils; this\
    \ novel approach will aid in understanding the origin and sustainable management\
    \ of ADEs as well as highly weathered and acid soils under humid tropical conditions.b)\
    \ Using DNA barcoding to describe the diversity of the ecosystem engineer community\
    \ associated with past and recent Amerindian settlements throughout the Amazonian\
    \ basin. c) Using genomics of a peregrine species closely related with human landscape\
    \ domestication to mirror the human exchanges and flow among the Neotropical rainforest\
    \ associated with the migration of Amazonian Indians.This will be achieved by\
    \ integrating the state-of-the-art methods in invertebrate morphology, molecular\
    \ genetics, and computational analyses with incorporation of pre-existent and\
    \ new ecological, anthropological and environmental metadata sustained by a multidisciplinary\
    \ collaborative network.\n"
