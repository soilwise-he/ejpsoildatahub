  title: 'Implementing a GIS-Based Digital Atlas of Agricultural Plastics to Reduce
    Their Environmental Footprint; Part I: A Deductive Approach'
  abstract: 'PAPILLONS will elucidate ecological and socioeconomic sustainability
    of agricultural plastics (APs) in relation to releases and impacts of micro- and
    nanoplastics (MNPs) in European soils. We will advance knowledge on sources, behaviour
    and impacts through cross-disciplinary research, bringing together scientists
    from chemistry, materials engineering, agronomy, soil ecology, toxicology and
    social sciences. We will transform the scientific knowledge generated into guidance
    on specific solutions by applying a Multi-actor approach, involving actors in
    the agricultural and policy sector and world-leading industries. This will enable
    co-creation of knowledge and provide the scientific background to enable policy,
    agricultural and industrial innovation towards sustainable farm production systems.We
    will deliver the first digital European atlas of AP use, management and waste
    production to estimate sources of MNP to agricultural soils. We will run integrative
    studies at laboratory, mesocosm and field scales in different parts of Europe
    to address; occurrence of AP-derived MNPs; MNP behaviour and transport in soil;
    uptake by biota and crops; long-term impacts on soil properties, fertility and
    ecological services; effects on biological and functional diversity across multiple
    scales; effects on plant production and quality; and socioeconomic impacts of
    AP-based practices. We will focus on multigenerational effect studies for relevant
    traditional and biodegradable polymers, at realistic and future high-exposure
    scenarios.PAPILLONS partners pioneered soil MNP research, host the majority of
    European analytical capacity for assessing soil contamination and will provide
    validated, high-throughput analysis for MNPs in soil. Using innovative applications
    of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry, we will advance analysis down to the
    nanoscale range and develop novel radiolabelled nanoplastics for accurately tracking
    behaviour and transport in soil and uptake by biota and crops.
