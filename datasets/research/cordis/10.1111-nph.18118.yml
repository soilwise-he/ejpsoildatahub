  title: "Deciphering the role of specialist and generalist plant\u2013microbial interactions\
    \ as drivers of plant\u2013soil feedback"
  abstract: "In a process known as plant-soil feedback, plants can modify soil microbial\
    \ communities in ways that differentially affect the performance of subsequent\
    \ generations of plants. Recent studies suggest that plant-soil feedbacks may\
    \ play an important role in plant community assembly and functioning, affecting\
    \ plant species co-existence, primary productivity, succession and plant invasions.\
    \ However, we still lack a basic understanding of how plant-soil feedbacks vary\
    \ between different habitats and soil types. Moreover, plant-soil feedbacks may\
    \ not only affect community and ecosystem-level processes but may also contribute\
    \ to evolutionary dynamics within species and affect genetic diversity. The overarching\
    \ aim of this project is to assess variation in the strength and direction of\
    \ plant-soil feedbacks along soil fertility gradients in temperate grassland ecosystems\
    \ at local through to large spatial scales. The proposal includes high-quality\
    \ training and knowledge exchange between three countries. By combining concepts\
    \ and experimental approaches from different disciplines, such as plant ecology,\
    \ soil science, population biology and evolutionary and microbial ecology, we\
    \ will build a mechanistic framework to predict plant-soil feedbacks in different\
    \ environmental contexts and to assess their contribution to the maintenance of\
    \ genetic diversity within grassland plant species. Collectively, improved knowledge\
    \ of plant-soil feedbacks along soil gradients will enhance our capacity to identify\
    \ those ecosystems most vulnerable to human impacts, such as invasions and land\
    \ use change, and will enhance conservation and restoration of natural habitats.\
    \ This proposal contributes to addressing one of the most pertinent societal challenges\
    \ \u2013 maintenance of biodiversity in the face of global change \u2013 and includes\
    \ a range of activities to engage with different audiences and stakeholders on\
    \ the topic of soil biodiversity.\n"
