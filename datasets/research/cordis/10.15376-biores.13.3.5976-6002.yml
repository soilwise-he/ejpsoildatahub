  title: Effects of biomass type, carbonization process, and activation method on
    the properties of bio-based activated carbons
  abstract: 'MOBILE FLIP aims at developing and demonstrating mobile processes for
    the treatment of underexploited agro- and forest based biomass resources into
    products and intermediates. The processes will be evaluated in terms of raw material
    flexibility, as the biomass resources are typically scattered and seasonal. Process
    concepts have been designed around the key technologies pelletizing, torrefaction,
    slow pyrolysis, hydrothermal pretreatment and carbonisation. The products vary
    depending on the process concept, being typically fuels as such or for co-combustion
    (pellets, torrefied pellets, biocoals), biochars for soil remediation, biodegradable
    pesticides for agricultural or forestry use or chemicals for wood panel industry
    and sugars and hydrolysable cellulose as intermediate for the sugar platform.  Some
    of the products are marketable as such, while some others are intermediates to
    be further valorised by integrated large industries. In the latter case, the mobile
    unit pre-extracts the valuable components or densifies the biomass to reduce transportation
    costs. Over-the-fence integration to large industries will be one means to ensure
    the availability of utilities, such as steam and electricity, whereas in some
    mobile process concepts the utilities can be produced at site for internal or
    external uses. The concept evaluations are supported both by research and industrial
    (SME and large industries) partners in the whole value chains. Preliminary business
    plan is presented in the proposal and will be updated during the project. Dissemination,
    communication and exploitation activities will be an integral part of the project.
    A milestone is defined in the midterm of the project to identify the most feasible
    process lines for demonstration.  Life-cycle analysis and a wide sustainability
    evaluation (economic, environmental and social assessment) will be carried out
    for the process concepts in order to clarify their potential for flexible raw
    material valorisation.
