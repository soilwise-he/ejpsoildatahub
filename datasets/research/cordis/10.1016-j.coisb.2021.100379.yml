  title: Approaches for completing metabolic networks through metabolite damage and
    repair discovery
  abstract: 'Nature has hardly evolved biochemical reactions involving fluorine (F),
    the most abundant halogen on Earth. Organic compounds containing F (fluorochemicals)
    are, however, extremely relevant from an industrial point of view. Fluoropolymers
    are the main fluorochemicals in the market worldwide, and are exclusively synthesized
    using chemical methods. Moreover, current fluorination technologies usually involve
    corrosive and toxic reagents that have a negative impact on the environment. Designing
    sustainable bioprocesses based on alternative and safer fluorinating agents from
    renewable substrates is thus a long-sought-after, yet unfulfilled goal. SinFonia
    proposes to engineer the metabolically-versatile bacterium Pseudomonas putida
    to execute biofluorinations for generating novel fluoropolymers from renewable
    substrates. P. putida KT2440, a non-pathogenic soil bacterium, serves as an ideal
    microbial platform for F-dependent biochemical reactions due to its extraordinary
    resistance to harsh and stressful operating conditions. SinFonia will exploit
    natural selection to enhance bioproduction through a smart strain engineering
    approach in which bacterial growth will be coupled to biofluorination. Our target
    compounds are a whole family of fluorinated polyesters with enhanced physicochemical
    and material properties, with uses as self-cleaning surfaces, low-surface-energy
    coatings, bio-based lubricants, membranes for fuel cells, and anti-fouling materials.
    The versatile P. putida strains engineered during the project can be easily adapted
    to synthesize other added-value fluorochemicals. Unlike chemical processes, the
    source of F in our system will be NaF, an inexpensive and safe salt, and sugars
    as the main carbon source. In-depth analysis of all the environmental and economic
    benefits of the new fluorination technology, and interactive communication of
    social benefits associated with target products, are essential components of SinFonia.
