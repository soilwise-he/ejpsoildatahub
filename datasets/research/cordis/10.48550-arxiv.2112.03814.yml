  title: A Contrastive Distillation Approach for Incremental Semantic Segmentation
    in Aerial Images
  abstract: 'Forest fires are exacerbated by extreme weather conditions, which are
    increasing both in frequency and in magnitude due to climate change effects. This
    points to the need for improving the effectiveness of emergency management solutions
    aimed to help society in becoming more resilient to emergencies arising before,
    during and after forest fire events. Therefore, it is proposed to realize a comprehensive
    Emergency Management System (EMS) that we name SAFERS; Structured Approaches for
    Forest fire Emergencies in Resilient Societies. SAFERS will act along the key
    phases of the emergency management cycle, coupling information from EO data and
    services offered by Copernicus and GEOSS, crowdsourced data from social media
    and from specific applications that can be used by both citizens as well as from
    in-field professional agents, data generated by accurate sensors to detect smoke
    or fires. Advanced algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence will be used to
    generate risk maps and early warnings in the preparedness phase, estimate the
    forest fire extension and its propagation in function of the forecasted weather
    and soil conditions in the response phase, compute the impacts of an extinguished
    fire in terms of economic losses and monitor the soil recovery in the post-event
    phase.
