  title: Introducing Beneficial Alleles from Plant Genetic Resources into the Wheat
    Germplasm
  abstract: 'AGENT aims to transform genebanks (GB) from living archives into bio-digital
    resources centres, equipped to meet the needs of a changing world. Fifteen GB
    and four genebank genomic centers will create a network to work exemplarily on
    barley and wheat for (i) establishing a European (global) crop genomic diversity
    atlas, (ii) activating currently inaccessible legacy phenotypic data, (iii) implementing
    a novel concept of concerted accumulation of phenologic and agronomic data for
    individual GenRes collections to establish training population datasets for the
    genome-wide prediction of untested GenRes accessions. Phenotyping will take into
    account diverse environmental conditions (climate, soil, geography, pathogens)
    provided by the diversity of eco-geographic locations of the participating GB
    and their partners. These activities will be supported by a bioinformatics network
    that will implement FAIR data principles, standards, protocols, and data formats  enabling
    data storage, access, use, and re-use, extending the existing EURISCO GenRes portal
    for new data types. AGENT will use existing solutions established by ongoing European
    projects and international initiatives, but also develop new tools for novel functionality
    of data access, visualisation, and use, which will be connected and implemented
    via plugin or web-services, allowing their incorporation in EURISCO and other
    data portals, and their easy application to other crop GenRes, based on data already
    available at EURISCO or provided by AGENT partner GB. A coordinated testing network
    is another unique layer of AGENT, directly involving stakeholders (e.g. farmer
    cooperatives, breeding companies, NGOs) in monitoring, mentoring, capacity building
    and training in the development of workflows and tools. Thus, AGENT project results
    will be directly disseminated to GB, researchers, breeders, policy makers and
    the general public and raise awareness of the general as well as the specific
    societal importance of GenRes.
