  title: Impacts of elevation on plant traits and volatile organic compound emissions
    in deciduous tundra shrubs
  abstract: 'Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) influence atmospheric oxidation
    causing climate feedback thought to be especially significant in remote areas
    with low anthropogenic emissions, such as the Arctic. Still, we do not understand
    the dynamics and impact of climatic and biotic BVOC emission drivers in arctic
    and alpine tundra, which are highly temperature-sensitive BVOC sources.TUVOLU
    will redefine tundra BVOC emission estimates to account for rapid and dramatic
    climate warming accompanied by effects of vegetation change, permafrost thaw,
    insect outbreaks and herbivory using multidisciplinary, established and novel
    methodology.We will quantify the relationships between leaf and canopy temperatures
    and BVOC emissions to improve BVOC emission model predictions of emission rates
    in low-statured tundra vegetation, which efficiently heats up. We will experimentally
    determine the contribution of induced BVOC emissions from insect herbivory in
    the warming Arctic by field manipulation experiments addressing basal herbivory
    and insect outbreaks and by stable isotope labelling to identify sources of the
    induced emission. Complementary laboratory assessment will determine if permafrost
    thaw leads to significant BVOC emissions from thawing processes and newly available
    soil processes, or if released BVOCs are largely taken up by soil microbes. We
    will also use a global network of existing climate warming experiments in alpine
    tundra to assess how the BVOC emissions from tundra vegetation world-wide respond
    to climate change.Measurement data will help develop and parameterize BVOC emission
    models to produce holistic enhanced predictions for global tundra emissions. Finally,
    modelling will be used to estimate emission impact on tropospheric ozone concentrations
    and secondary organic aerosol levels, producing the first assessment of arctic
    BVOC-mediated feedback on regional air quality and climate.
