  title: Phytoextraction of Cu, Cd, Zn and As in four shrubs and trees growing on
    soil contaminated with mining waste
  abstract: "Phy2Climate will validate 5 phytoremediation pilots in Spain (South Europe),\
    \ Serbia (Balkan region), Lithuania (Baltic region), Argentina (South America)\
    \ and India (South Asia) at TRL-5. The selected contaminated sites represent the\
    \ most common soil contaminants worldwide. The phytoremediation pilots will produce\
    \ energy crops with none indirect Land Use Change (iLUC) issues. The energy crops\
    \ will feed a pilot biorefinery in Germany that combines cutting edge biomass\
    \ processing technologies to produce 4 types of clean drop-in biofuels for the\
    \ road and shipping transport sectors at TRL-5; EN 14214 biodiesel, ISO 8217 marine\
    \ fuels, EN 590 diesel and EN 228 gasoline. Additionally, bio-coke will be also\
    \ produced as substitution of petroleum coke in the metallurgical industry. A\
    \ significant cost reduction in factor >5 for phytoremediation compared with common\
    \ remediation techniques is target together with conversion costs of drop-in biofuel\
    \ production <0,45 \u20AC/l. The global biofuel production potential of the Phy2Climate\
    \ approach is estimated up to 137 million m3 per year. Furthermore, estimated\
    \ specific Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation of the produced drop-in biofuels is\
    \ 149% compared with the fossil equivalents, resulting in a total saving potential\
    \ of 500 Mega-tones CO2eq per year. The work programme is divided in 7 work packages\
    \ that are specifically designed to achieve the objectives of the project as well\
    \ as to contribute to the Mission Innovation Challenge 4 and to 16 UN Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals. The Phy2Climate consortium unites 17 partners from 10 different\
    \ countries with strong interdisciplinary expertise in the fields of project management,\
    \ soil remediation & phytoremediation, advanced biofuel technologies, environmental\
    \ and social sustainability, legal analysis, business development and communication\
    \ &dissemination. Additionally 11 stakeholders from 8 countries and at EU level\
    \ have already expressed their interest in the project by a letter of support.\n"
