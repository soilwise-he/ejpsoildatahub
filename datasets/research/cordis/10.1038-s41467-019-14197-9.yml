  title: High-quality genome sequence of white lupin provides insight into soil exploration
    and seed quality
  abstract: "Plant development is continuous throughout their lifetime and reflects\
    \ their ability to adapt to their environment. This developmental plasticity is\
    \ very obvious in the development of the root system. Surprisingly, the fundamental\
    \ mechanisms of root development have been studied into great detail but the effect\
    \ of the environment on its plasticity is still largely unknown. I will use phosphate,\
    \ since this nutrient has a very low mobility in soil, as a mean to study plant\
    \ developmental adaptation in white lupin.This species has developed extreme adaptive\
    \ mechanism to improve phosphate uptake by producing structures called \u201C\
    cluster roots\u201D. They are dense clusters of lateral roots with determinate\
    \ development and highly specific physiology. I will develop new tools to identify\
    \ cluster root mutants in white lupin, sequence white lupin genome, perform tissues\
    \ specific transcriptomics and perform full molecular characterization of selected\
    \ genes. This project will also lead me to compare adaptive mechanisms between\
    \ white lupin and narrow-leafed lupin, a closely related species that does not\
    \ produce cluster roots. We will also test whether it is possible to transfer\
    \ the ability to form cluster roots in this species. Altogether, this project\
    \ will lead to a major advance in our capacity to understand how plants are able\
    \ to sense and respond to their environment and how evolution has selected adaptive\
    \ developmental mechanisms to improve their capacity to use limited resources.This\
    \ project focuses on the most extreme developmental adaptation produced in response\
    \ to phosphate starvation. It is ambitious, as it will necessitate the development\
    \ of several tools. However, it is highly feasible since it builds on my previous\
    \ experience and important outcome can be expected in term of crop improvement\
    \ and means to reduce the use of phosphate fertilizers.\n"
