  title: Monitoring of wheat crops using the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric
    coherence derived from Sentinel-1 in semi-arid areas
  abstract: 'The Mediterranean and Sahel regions are among the most sensitive areas
    to climate change as demonstrated in many studies (IPCC, 2013). Increased rainfall
    variability and ET rates will compromise irrigation potential and expansion plans
    and increased competition and conflict over limited water resources. There are
    significant knowledge gaps and uncertainties about how much water will be available
    for a complete growing season, how much should be used for scheduling irrigation
    efficiently and extracted from these regions. More information regarding water
    use is necessary to improve agricultural planning and to manage water more efficiently
    at different scales; farm and catchment/irrigation district level. Over both regions,
    the temperature increase will cause higher evaporation and transpiration rates,
    decreasing soil moisture and increasing crop water requirements. The expected
    impact in rainfed agriculture is a decrease in yield due to heat and water stress
    and an increase in the likelihood of crop failure in rainfed crops for maize,
    millet and sorghum (Parkes et al. 2018). Ongoing changes in the socio-economic
    and environmental background of rainfed farmers combined with the expected population
    growth make timely and reliable information on rainfed crop yield and its spatial
    variability essential in decision-support for improving food security and livelihoods.
    To this end, both understanding of the long term changes (inter-annual variability)
    and short-term changes (intra-annual variability) are needed.Temperature and precipitation
    changing patterns will also increase hazards linked to environmental conditions
    such as droughts, floods or crop pests like locust swarms. ACCWA aims to develop
    the remote sensing based monitoring tools for agriculture and water and management
    that help risk guidance in a climate change context.
