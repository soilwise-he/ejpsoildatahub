  title: The Optimisation Analysis of Sand-Clay Mixtures Stabilised with Xanthan Gum
    Biopolymers
  abstract: 'Railway embankments are at the risk of serious deformation caused either
    by the dynamic loads from moving vehicles, geohazards or both, and as such pose
    a threat to not only safety, but comfortable rail operations. Given that Europe
    cannot always be building its way out of ageing railway infrastructure, it must
    therefore retrofit and complement existing assets with new technologies. Moreover,
    the ability to predict and repair damaged railway earthwork in a cost-effective
    and time-efficient manner to ensure a safer, more reliable, efficient, sustainable
    and resilient railway earthwork infrastructure offers a great value not just to
    transport network operators but also to utilities, insurance companies and government
    agencies. Therefore, this fellowship improves the resiliency of railway earthwork
    infrastructure and mitigates potential economic, life, and property losses resulting
    from failure to apply a systematic approach. A toolkit and platform to enable
    the integration of resiliency-improving forecasting will be developed by combining
    traditional laboratory and field studies, data mining, machine learning, uncertainty
    quantification and reliability-based design so to utilize the data to its full
    potential, and an ecofriendly reinforcement control by using biopolymer for railway
    embankment deformation. This project will address critical gaps remaining in our
    understanding of the life cycle performance of biopolymer-reinforced railway earthworks
    related to material synthesis, degradation, repair as well as the interaction
    with the soil ecosystem through integrated geochemical and geotechnical experiments
    and numerical modeling.
