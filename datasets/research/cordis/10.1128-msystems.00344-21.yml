  title: Network Properties of Local Fungal Communities Reveal the Anthropogenic Disturbance
    Consequences of Farming Practices in Vineyard Soils
  abstract: "Biome Makers is an innovative biotech company founded in 2015 by two\
    \ well-recognized Spanish entrepreneurs, based in both Spain (14 employees) and\
    \ U.S. (6 employees). We were named one of the Most Innovative Startups at the\
    \ AgFunder Innovation Awards and Worldwide Agripreneur of 2019 in the future Agro\
    \ Challenge. By combining DNA Sequencing technologies to profile the whole spectrum\
    \ of microbes populating in the soils and proprietary Artificial Intelligence,\
    \ we are using ecological computing algorithms to understand this complex network\
    \ of microorganisms. The final goal is to provide insights and innovative metrics\
    \ measuring soil bioactivity to improve agricultural yields and lower its environmental\
    \ impact. Biome Makers have developed the first patented smart soil microbiome-based\
    \ platform with a unique database of more than 5,000 soil samples from 20 different\
    \ countries worldwide. In this context, BeCrop\xAE rises as an innovative product\
    \ that will provide a detailed snapshot of the health status of crop soils, by\
    \ giving metrics about crop diseases risks, general biodiversity, an nutritional\
    \ shortcomings, through the identification of the whole soil microbiome (the known\
    \ +67K microbial species but also the unknown) with only a soil sample per ha.\
    \ BeCrop\xAE is the direct evolution of our system WineSeq\xAE, developed by Biome\
    \ Makers. WineSeq\xAE is the first and the only intelligent platform designed\
    \ for the wine sector for the characterization and comparison of the microbial\
    \ communities that influence the quality and the organoleptic properties of wine,\
    \ through a genomic NGS tool. In this context, the development of BeCrop\xAE relies\
    \ on the need to develop a complete soil microbiome diagnosis and microbial interactions\
    \ understanding to identify potential microbial biomarkers to measure the health\
    \ and quality of soils and, thus, to predict disease threats, functional bioactivity,\
    \ as well as providing practical ag-input recommendations into a near future.\n"
