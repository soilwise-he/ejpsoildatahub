  title: 'Unpacking ecosystem service bundles: Towards predictive mapping of synergies
    and trade-offs between ecosystem services'
  abstract: "It is now widely recognized that sustainably managing ecosystem services\
    \ \u2013 the benefits humans obtain from nature \u2013 is essential for humanity\u2019\
    s prospects in the 21st century and beyond. However, at present there is little\
    \ data on the distribution of most services in most places.To date, the discipline\
    \ of ecosystem service mapping has tried overcome this lack of data by using proxies\
    \ to map ecosystem services based on our perceived understanding of ecosystem\
    \ services from small-scale studies. However, the most commonly used proxies have\
    \ been shown to be inaccurate, particularly for understanding policy-relevant\
    \ trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. The challenge therefore\
    \ remains - how do we reliably map such relationships between multiple ES, thereby\
    \ enabling multifunctional, ES-based management of our landscapes?In the SCALEFORES\
    \ project, I will address this challenge head-on by developing and testing a novel\
    \ methodological framework that enables the use of existing data to produce accurate\
    \ maps of the relationships between ES in previously unmapped regions.  The overarching\
    \ idea underpinning SCALEFORES is that we can use information on the scale-dependency\
    \ of relationships between existing social and ecological datasets (e.g. land\
    \ cover, soil type, human population density) to create maps of trade-offs and\
    \ win-wins between ecosystem services. The SCALEFORES project will systematically\
    \ examine the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and\
    \ the social and ecological variables that underpin them. It will then use this\
    \ knowledge to enable a step change increase in our ability to accurately map\
    \ both relationships between ES and the distributions of ecosystem services themselves.\
    \  The methodology developed in SCALEFORES will be validated against existing\
    \ maps of ecosystem services in Europe, as this is the region with the best data\
    \ on ecosystem services globally.\n"
