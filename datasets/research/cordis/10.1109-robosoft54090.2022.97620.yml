  title: 3D micromolding of seed-like probes for self-burying soft robots
  abstract: 'I-Seed aims at developing a new generation of self-deployable and biodegradable
    soft miniaturized robots, inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities
    of plant seeds, to perform a low-cost, environmentally responsible, in-situ detection
    of key environmental parameters in air and topsoil. Seeds dispersal strategies
    are driven by the spontaneous, often reversible, anisotropic deformation of their
    tissues upon swelling or drying of cell walls, and do not require any control
    or internal energy supply.Following a bioinspired design, these skills will be
    implemented into seed-like robots by using multi-functional biodegradable materials
    and natural morphological features, which endow them with the ability to fly and
    disperse via natural vector-mediated diffusion in air, or to respond to humidity
    variations to move on terrain surface and self-penetrate in topsoil. Sensing will
    be based on diffusion, absorption, and structural changes of parts of the robots
    made from sensor materials with a chemical transduction mechanism and fluorescence-based
    optical readout. Recordings of temperature, humidity, CO2 and mercury (Hg2+) will
    be executed at air-soil interface. Deployment of the I-Seed robots and reading
    of the acquired measurements will be performed using drones. Seed-drone communication
    will rely on optical signaling and fluorescence based on Light Detection and Ranging
    technology (fLiDAR), and using photonic tags to impart different type of sensors
    and robots a unique response. Algorithms will be developed such that drones can
    map the robots in air and on the ground.By merging bioinspired soft robotics,
    material science, nanocomposite technologies, and environmental science, I-Seed
    will address the specific challenge by building a radically new dynamic scenario
    for analyzing and monitoring air and topsoil environments and their interface,
    extending environmental sensor networks and filling existing gaps of data analysis
    systems.
