  title: Durable Self-Cleaning Coatings for Architectural Surfaces by Incorporation
    of TiO2 Nano-Particles into Hydroxyapatite Films
  abstract: "The HAP4MARBLE Project is aimed at developing a new multi-functional\
    \ treatment for conservation of marble artworks in Cultural Heritage (CH) and\
    \ validating it in the field. Marble has been widely used in architecture and\
    \ sculpture since antiquity, but it is subject to several weathering processes,\
    \ predicted to be worsened by future climate change. Because not fully satisfying\
    \ treatment currently exists against these weathering processes, the project will\
    \ be aimed at multi-functionalizing a recently proposed biomimetic treatment based\
    \ on hydroxyapatite (HAP), to make it able to tackle all the main marble degradation\
    \ processes (sugaring, soiling, dissolution and bowing). This target requires\
    \ a multi-disciplinary reserach activity, combining materials science, biomaterials,\
    \ micro-mechanics, petrophysics and CH conservation. Such an approach will be\
    \ possible by merging competences and laboratory facilities of the 3 involved\
    \ Organizations; Princeton University (outgoing phase, supervisor Prof. G.W. Scherer\
    \ and co-supervisor Prof. W.O. Soboyejo, world-renowned experts in materials science\
    \ and micro-mechanics, respectively), the University of G\xF6ttingen (secondment,\
    \ supervisor Prof. S. Siegesmund, international expert in marble deterioration)\
    \ and the University of Bologna (return phase, supervisor Dr. E. Franzoni and\
    \ co-supervisor Prof. N. Roveri, international experts in materials for CH conservation\
    \ and HAP for bio-medical applications, respectively). Under the guidance of these\
    \ experts, the Experienced Researcher (ER) will receive high-level training-through-research\
    \ and will considerably deepen and diversify his knowledge, by also attending\
    \ academic and training courses, thus developing a multi-disciplinary expertise.\
    \ This new expertise and the publication of research results in high-level journals\
    \ will enable the ER to achieve a fundamental advancement towards the fulfilment\
    \ of his career development objective, which is to become a tenured researcher\
    \ in EU academia.\n"
