  title: Developing REE parameters for soil and sediment profile analysis to identify
    Neolithic anthropogenic signatures at Serpis Valley (Spain).
  abstract: "The aim of the innovative MATRIX project is to establish a new interdisciplinary\
    \ and multidisciplinary methodological approach that combines archaeology, chemistry\
    \ and geology for the identification of anthropogenic deposits in archaeological\
    \ excavations through rare earth elements (REE) soil analysis, pushing current\
    \ limitations of traditional chemical and sedimentology techniques. REE are a\
    \ set of seventeen elements in the periodic table, specifically fifteen lanthanides\
    \ as well as scandium and yttrium. Crucially, these elements are relatively abundant\
    \ in the earth\u2019s crust and thanks to their characteristics can be employed\
    \ as unambiguous markers of soil provenance on archaeological sites worldwide.Many\
    \ techniques may be able to reveal ancient human activities, however integrated\
    \ approaches can be reinforced by the employment of REE patterns as proved by\
    \ my previous and ongoing research; an approach that does not merely observe coarse\
    \ differences between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sediments, but is also\
    \ able to see finer nuances like the degree of human contributions to the formation\
    \ of ancient soils (palaeosols), adding new ways to tackle a classic archaeological\
    \ problem that has increasing modern relevance; how do we discern the impact of\
    \ ancient human activities on the soils that are a pivotal component of environmental\
    \ and economic sustainability.Agricultural human activities or livestock is reflected\
    \ with higher REE concentrations compared with the natural REE soil level. Probably\
    \ this is related to the enrichment in soil of the organic matter and this transformation\
    \ remain fingerprinted in the REE concentrations at stratigraphic levels of any\
    \ chronological period. In archaeological site or modern site were the presence\
    \ of human activities has change the natural landscape REE method is an optimum\
    \ skill to clarify the stratigraphic impact in the soil and as well the soil occupation\
    \ and  abandonment dynamics.\n"
