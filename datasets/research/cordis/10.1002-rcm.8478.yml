  title: "Determination of the triple oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of CO2\
    \ from atomic ion fragments formed in the ion source of the 253 Ultra high\u2010\
    resolution isotope ratio mass spectrometer"
  abstract: "Severe droughts in Amazonia in 2005 and 2010 caused widespread loss of\
    \ carbon from the terrestrial biosphere. This loss, almost twice the annual fossil\
    \ fuel CO2 emissions in the EU, suggests a large sensitivity of the Amazonian\
    \ carbon balance to a predicted more intense drought regime in the next decades.\
    \ This is a dangerous inference though, as there is no scientific consensus on\
    \ the most basic metrics of Amazonian carbon exchange; the gross primary production\
    \ (GPP) and its response to moisture deficits in the soil and atmosphere. Measuring\
    \ them on scales that span the whole Amazon forest was thus far impossible, but\
    \ in this project I aim to deliver the first observation-based estimate of pan-Amazonian\
    \ GPP and its drought induced variations. My program builds on two recent breakthroughs\
    \ in our use of stable isotopes (13C, 17O, 18O) in atmospheric CO2; (1) Our discovery\
    \ that observed \u03B4\xB9\xB3C in CO2 in the atmosphere is a quantitative measure\
    \ for vegetation water-use efficiency over millions of square kilometers, integrating\
    \ the drought response of individual plants. (2) The possibility to precisely\
    \ measure the relative ratios of 18O/16O and 17O/16O in CO2, called \u039417O.\
    \ Anomalous \u039417O values are present in air coming down from the stratosphere,\
    \ but this anomaly is removed upon contact of CO2 with leaf water inside plant\
    \ stomata. Hence, observed \u039417O values depend directly on the magnitude of\
    \ GPP. Both \u03B4\xB9\xB3C and \u039417O measurements are scarce over the Amazon-basin,\
    \ and I propose more than 7000 new measurements leveraging an established aircraft\
    \ monitoring program in Brazil. Quantitative interpretation of these observations\
    \ will break new ground in our use of stable isotopes to understand climate variations,\
    \ and is facilitated by our renowned numerical modeling system \u201CCarbonTracker\u201D\
    . My program will answer two burning question in carbon cycle science today; (a)\
    \ What is the magnitude of GPP in Amazonia? And (b) How does it vary over different\
    \ intensities of drought?\n"
