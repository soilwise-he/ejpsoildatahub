  title: How Plants Sense and Respond to Stressful Environments
  abstract: "A major gap in our knowledge of how plants respond to soil salinity is\
    \ their initial perception of sodium (Na+) ions. Salt is detrimental to plants\
    \ and soil salinization is an increasing threat to global food security; 6% of\
    \ the world\u2019s total land area and 20% of irrigated land is affected by salinity.\
    \ I recently discovered Na+-specific root growth responses of plants and will\
    \ now exploit these to identify the elusive sodium sensing mechanism of plants.\
    \ I will use an innovative approach combining genome-wide genetic screens in the\
    \ model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with dedicated biochemical assays. I will identify\
    \ candidate Na+-sensor genes through a natural genetic variation screen for the\
    \ Na+-specific inhibition bending of the root in response to gravity (WP1). In\
    \ parallel, I will follow a chemical genomics approach to find novel compounds\
    \ that impair Na+ sensing, and their target proteins in plants (WP2). Subsequent\
    \ complementary in silico and biochemical approaches will characterize Na+-affinity\
    \ of the candidates (WP3). Selected putative Na+ sensors will be characterized\
    \ in planta, by studying their localization, activity, their interactors, and\
    \ by salt response phenotyping of mutants (WP4). Finally, mutant varieties of\
    \ sensors will be introduced in the economically relevant crop plant tomato, to\
    \ provide proof-of-concept for improving salt tolerance by modulating sensor function\
    \ and implementation in crop improvement programs (WP5). The impact of elucidation\
    \ of plant Na+ sensing will be monumental; it will reveal how plant responses\
    \ to salinity stress are driven, and ultimately what is required to cope with\
    \ salinity. In addition, it will open up new applied directions for agriculture,\
    \ where improved sodium sensing modules will be used to allow crop growth on marginal,\
    \ saline soils.\n"
