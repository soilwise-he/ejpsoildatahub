  title: 'In defence of soil biodiversity: Towards an inclusive protection in the
    European Union'
  abstract: 'With the long-term view of fostering synergies between crop production,
    biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services of local, regional and global
    relevance, the main objective of SoildiverAgro is the adoption of new management
    practices and cropping systems that enhance soil genetic and functional biodiversity
    to reduce the use of external inputs while increasing crop production and quality,
    the delivery of ecosystem services and the EU agricultural stability and resilience.
    To achieve this objective 90 farm systems will be analysed in 9 pedoclimatic regions
    in Europe  and 15 field case studies will be designed and established in six of
    the pedoclimatic regions. The focus will be on the use of innovative management
    practices based on soil mycorrhiza and plant growth promoting bacteria (including
    the development and testing of new commercial products), appropriate management
    of soil organisms (e.g. fungivores), the application of suitable crop rotations,
    multiple cropping and intercropping, the development of pest alert systems, the
    use of nutrient catch crops, the use of trap crops for pest control, the use of
    by-products as soil ameliorants and the application of adequate tillage systems.
    SoildiverAgro outputs consider; 1) enhancement of soil biodiversity; 2) reduction
    of pest/diseases incidence; 3) increases in plant growth and development; 4) increases
    in crop yields, quality and value; 5) the reduction of inputs; 6) increases in
    soil fertility; 7) reductions of soil contamination; 8) reduction in GHG emissions;
    and 9) increases in soil C sequestration. To ensure rapid adoption of measures
    fostering soil biodiversity, improved methods and tools including for monitoring
    will be developed. The successful crop management practices will be also analysed
    from the environmental, economic and social perspectives. Operational diversity
    targets will be defined, with development of best agricultural practice strategies
    and tools for existing EU policies update.
