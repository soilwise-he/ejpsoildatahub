  title: Inhibition of Ammonia Monooxygenase from Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaea by Linear
    and Aromatic Alkynes
  abstract: "The global nitrogen cycle is of fundamental importance for our climate\
    \ as well as agriculture, and both are facing significant threats due to environmental\
    \ change. Anthropogenic input of synthetic ammonia-based fertilisers has a profound\
    \ impact on the nitrogen cycle. Most soil ecosystems globally are nitrogen limited,\
    \ necessitating ammonia-based fertiliser to achieve sufficient crop yield to feed\
    \ the world\u2019s growing population. However, circa 70% of fertiliser is lost\
    \ through the activity of ammonia oxidising microorganisms, which contribute to\
    \ the emission of the extremely damaging greenhouse gas nitrous oxide \u2013 a\
    \ molecule with a global warming potential 300 times that of CO2, and also the\
    \ most important ozone-depleting gas. Ammonia oxidising microorganisms are ubiquitous,\
    \ highly abundant organisms. Despite their ubiquity and major environmental importance,\
    \ they are some of the least well-understood microorganisms in the global nitrogen\
    \ cycle. Several challenges contribute to the lack of our understanding; (1) Ammonia\
    \ oxidisers are difficult to cultivate, (2) the molecular mechanisms driving their\
    \ adaptation to different environments are poorly characterised, and (3) links\
    \ between their cellular and physiological traits and the rates of nitrogen turnover\
    \ are not understood. Consequently, it is difficult to interpret the ecological\
    \ and environmental significance of many research findings. This research programme\
    \ will bridge the gaps in our understanding of terrestrial nitrogen cycling using\
    \ a combination of highly innovative methods. My research programme aims to reveal\
    \ functions of uncultivated ammonia oxidisers and determine the important but\
    \ overlooked role of cellular traits in nitrogen cycling rates in terrestrial\
    \ environments. This study will provide a holistic framework of terrestrial nitrogen\
    \ cycling from molecules to ecosystems and will deliver a major advance towards\
    \ balancing the global nitrogen cycle.\n"
