  title: The impact of fermentation on the distribution of cadmium in cacao beans
  abstract: 'Ever-increasing production of waste requires new provisions for waste
    management to ensure sustainable development. The use of organic waste (OW) as
    fertiliser is a promising route but may represent an environmental pathway for
    flows of contaminants. In Europe and across the world, antibiotic resistance genes
    (ARGs) and trace elements (TEs) are seen as two major threats to environmental
    and human health. Overcoming the lack of knowledge of the role of TEs as a selective
    agent in the proliferation of ARGs is a major scientific challenge today. The
    overall objectives of SPECTRE are to (i) link the spatial distribution of TE speciation
    in OWs with the development of resistance at microscale and (ii) to assess the
    fate of TEs and ARGs in the OW-soil-plant system. During the SPECTRE project,
    I will take full advantage of my time at the interdisciplinary Future Industries
    Institute (FII, University of South Australia) to acquire new skills in molecular
    biology to screen interesting bacterial community members and (ii) increase my
    expertise in TE speciation by harnessing the analytical power of a spectroscopic
    cutting-edge technique. This training will position me as a leader in Europe in
    this rapidly advancing field. Furthermore, the unique FII environment will enable
    me to develop my transversal skills and gain experience in the management of public-private
    research partnerships. Knowledge transfer (blended learning, hands-on training,
    training-through-research) is essential to broaden the scope of my research as
    well as reinforce my future career prospects. Beyond the publication of scientific
    papers, I will make a particular effort to ensure that the results are widely
    disseminated to different audiences; schoolchildren (social networking, video
    link facilities), school teachers (professional development), end-users in the
    agro-environmental sector (workshop, seminar) and MSc students (e-learning).
