  title: 'Deployment and Verifications of the Spatial Filtering of Data Measured by
    Field Harvesters and Methods of Their Interpolation: Czech Cereal Fields between
    2014 and 2018'
  abstract: 'SIEUSOIL will design, implement and test a shared China-EU Web Observatory
    platform that will provide Open Linked Data to monitor status and threats of soil
    and assist in decision making for sustainable support of agro-ecosystem functions,
    in view of the projected climate change. The Observatory platform will through
    customizable modules support the wise management of soil at field level and will
    provide showcase of good practices on soil management both for EU and China. The
    final target will be to support sustainable management of soil, increase land
    productivity sustainably, reduce crop yield variability across time and space,
    and support the policy formulation process. Innovative practices and tools will
    be tested in SIEUSOIL and their impact will be assessed for improved soil fertility
    and land suitability.
