  title: Screw pile design optimisation under tension in sand
  abstract: 'Classical anchoring solutions are inappropriate for the development of
    new marine renewable energy devices (wind/waves/tides). They are too expensive
    and not efficient. Organising devices in arrays is a solution where adjacent devices
    share an anchor. It reduces the total number of anchors necessary and the overall
    cost. In turn the loading applied to an anchor is a complex combination of horizontal
    and uplift cyclic loads. Screw anchors are piles which are fitted with one or
    several helices at their end. They are installed into the soil by applying a torque
    and are assumed to have an excellent resistance against uplifting.The objective
    of this work is to study the fundamental behaviour of screw anchors upon complex
    loading in sand. A unique database of physical modelling tests (using cutting
    edge centrifuge apparatus) representative of small arrays of devices will be developed.
    In particular the tests will assess their uplift capacity after low level cyclic
    loading (fatigue behaviour). Numerical simulations, validated against experimental
    results, will provide additional information. Finally a new design methodology
    taking into account multi-directional and fatigue loading will be derived. This
    comprehensive topic has never been investigated before in sand.The University
    of Dundee offers cutting edge centrifuge facilities and has an outstanding experience
    in physical modelling. A designed experimental set-up is able to install screw
    piles in flight and apply a multi-directional loading. I will build on my strong
    background in numerical modelling to carry out the numerical part of the project.EU
    targets the ambitious objective to derive 20% of its electricity production from
    renewable sources by 2020. The energy revolution has just started and should generate
    many jobs and investments in Europe. This project will clear technical and economical
    hurdles associated with anchoring. It will improve competitiveness and leadership
    of EU on the renewable energy market.
