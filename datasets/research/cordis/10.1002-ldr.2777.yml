  title: Tracing Pb Pollution Penetration in Temperate Podzols
  abstract: 'The sustainability of an agricultural system relies largely on the resistance
    of soils -their capacity to perform its five environmental functions under disturbance-
    and in their resilience, meaning the capacity of the soils of restoring its functions
    after impact. The tRRACES project aims to get insights into how past or indigenous
    strategies for agricultural management drove pedogenetic pathways with a focus
    on the sustainability of the agroecosystem. New data on pedogenetic evolution
    of four ancient agricultural systems in Chile, Ethiopia Spain and Tanzania, spanning
    a wide range of environmental conditions, are to be put together with archaeological,
    ethnographical and paleoenvironmental knowledge, in order to show up the effects
    of ancient soil management strategies on the maintenance of soil environmental
    functions and therefore on soil resistance and resilience. The results will be
    used to predict the evolution of these systems when facing impending climatic
    and socioeconomic changes. tRRACES will provide a sound scientific basis for the
    so called indigenous knowledge and will contribute highly valuable information
    for the studies on sustainable land-use, meaning that it is possible to state
    with confidence that the proposed project will undoubtedly produce useful data
    for modern developmental and conservationist narratives.
