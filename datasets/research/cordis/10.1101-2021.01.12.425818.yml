  title: Plant-derived benzoxazinoids act as antibiotics and shape bacterial communities
  abstract: "In natural and agricultural habitats, plants grow in organismal communities\
    \ and therefore have to compete for limited resources. Competition between different\
    \ crop plants and between crops and weeds leads to losses of potential agricultural\
    \ product and requires heavy use of fertilizer and herbicides, with negative effects\
    \ for the environment and human health. Plants have evolved various strategies\
    \ to outcompete their neighbours and to secure their access to resources; one\
    \ of them is the release of toxic chemical compounds into the soil that interfere\
    \ with the growth of neighbouring plants. Many of today\u2019s major crops, such\
    \ as wheat, rye and maize, produce phytotoxins. Conversely, crop species also\
    \ suffer from chemical attack by other plants growing in their vicinity. Although\
    \ many of the chemical compounds applied in this biochemical warfare have been\
    \ identified, we know little about how they act in the target plant; neither do\
    \ we understand how some plant species are able to tolerate this chemical attack.FEAR-SAP\
    \ studies the genetic architecture that underlies biochemical plant-plant interference\
    \ and the evolution of weed resistance to crop-released phytotoxins. To this end\
    \ it employs a comprehensive array of molecular genetics, genomics and metagenomics\
    \ analyses, unprecedented in the research on plant-plant competition. The aims\
    \ of FEAR-SAP are to uncover the molecular targets of plant-derived phytotoxins\
    \ and to identify the genetic components that are essential for tolerance to these\
    \ substances. Moreover, FEAR-SAP investigates how the microbial community that\
    \ is associated with the plant might enhance efficiency of the donor and/or mediate\
    \ tolerance of the target plant. Ultimately, we will use this information to explore\
    \ intelligent engineering of more refined and competitive crops, which will be\
    \ at the foundation of efficient and ecologically responsible weed control and\
    \ improved crop rotation strategies.\n"
