  title: 'Electrocatalysis of N-doped carbons in the oxygen reduction reaction as
    a function of pH: N-sites and scaffold effects'
  abstract: "Plant microbial fuel cells (PMFC) are promising electrochemical devices\
    \ that can produce electricity generated by active microorganisms present in plant\
    \ soil. The reactions at both anode and cathode of PMFCs can be catalysed by microbial\
    \ biofilms capable of oxidising organic matter (anode) and catalysing oxygen reduction\
    \ (ORR) (cathode) producing electrical power from renewable resources. However,\
    \ PMFC power output to date remains low and often unpredictable due to the variability\
    \ in activity achieved by the electrodes microbial biofilms. Their selection in\
    \ both anode and cathode is a fundamental requirement to enhance catalytic activity\
    \ and produce higher power densities. This proposal aims at developing a conceptually\
    \ new approach towards PMFC catalysis though the introduction of novel nanocomposite\
    \ carbon electrodes that will combine intrinsic and microbially-mediated catalytic\
    \ activity. These functional materials will integrate moieties that promote bacterial\
    \ recruitment to select suitable microbial consortia onto carbon based electrodes\
    \ for both anodic and cathodic reactions. In the case of the cathode, the carbon\
    \ material will be selected by using electrochemical methods ex situ (voltammetry)\
    \ in simulated aqueous environment in the presence of fertilizers and soil to\
    \ also display ORR catalytic activity. Anode and cathode topography will be investigated\
    \ to identify nanostructures that promote biofilm colonisation and to control\
    \ density and stability of active sites. The best electrode materials will be\
    \ modified with carbohydrates and peptides that promote cell adhesion to only\
    \ recruit electroactive bacterial consortia. This project combines my expertise\
    \ in carbon synthesis and microbial fuel cell devices with expertise in biofilm\
    \ control and carbon material characterization of the host laboratory. New training\
    \ in characterization of electroactive biofilms will be provided by a secondment\
    \ through a cross \u2013 European collaboration at University of Rennes1\n"
