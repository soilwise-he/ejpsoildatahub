  title: A review of the use of microplastics in reconstructing dated sedimentary
    archives
  abstract: 'Plastic pollution has become a global environmental and societal concern
    in recent years. Numerous protocols have been developed to monitor plastic debris,
    but these are rarely comparable. This has hindered gathering of knowledge regarding
    pollution sources, development of monitoring programmes and risk assessments and
    implementation of mitigation measures. To develop long-term solutions to reduce
    plastic pollution, it is essential to establish harmonised methodologies. EUROqCHARM
    will address this by critically reviewing state-of-the-art analytical methods
    and, taking harmonisation one step further, validating them through an interlaboratory
    comparison (ILC) study. This will bring together prominent laboratories in environmental
    plastics analysis and will produce certified reference materials to be marketed
    for at least three of the four target matrices (water, soil/sediment, biota, air),
    during and after project completion.EUROqCHARM recognises that harmonisation for
    large scale monitoring requires flexibility, comparability and reliability. We
    will identify Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP), resulting in a catalogue
    of RAP procedures for nano-, micro- and macro-plastics for the four target matrices.
    Each RAP will be validated in terms of Technology Readiness Level to decide if
    further validation is needed (by ILC).Blueprints for standards, recommendations
    for policy and legislation and support for the establishment of acceptable reference
    levels and environmental targets will be given. This will include a roadmap for
    harmonised data collection and management, where policy analysis and coherence
    will be integral parts. To maximise impact, EUROqCHARM will also establish and
    consolidate an operational network for plastic monitoring, stimulating Transnational
    Joint Actions built on existing and future European and international initiatives.The
    multi-stakeholder composition of EUROqCHARM puts the group in a unique position
    to achieve these ambitious goals.
