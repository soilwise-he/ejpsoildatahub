  title: Historical evolution and new trends for soil-intruder interaction modeling
  abstract: 'Plants are connected to each other by an underground network of fungi
    that provide them with nutrients, help share resources, and extend their perception
    abilities. This mycorrhizal network, known as the Wood Wide Web, plays a crucial
    role in maintaining healthy natural ecosystems, and in limiting the global warming.
    Thus, it must be preserved in order to mitigate the speeding up of the carbon
    cycle and its effects on climate change. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) can offer concrete solutions for a deeper analysis of natural processes at
    the basis of this global change and for developing sustainable technologies. Based
    on that, I-Wood proposes a new paradigm of virtual and physical robotic networks
    inspired by the belowground fungus-mediated inter-plant communication and by the
    associated collective behaviours. Specifically, I-Wood will study, extract and
    formalize the rules of plant-fungus interaction mechanisms to develop; a plant-inspired
    perceptron-like model; and a new generation of plant-inspired robots able to explore
    soil using their roots with growing, ageing, branching, and elongating abilities
    in response to their network-augmented perception and implementing plant-inspired
    collective behaviours. By imitating plants, these distributed intelligent systems
    will co-develop morphology and behaviour in a dynamic environment. Impact and
    feasibility of the proposed approach will be tested in a mixed social network,
    scale-down in a confined environment, where robots will interact with real plants
    to facilitate the development of mycorrhizal networks. Grounded on a strong multi-disciplinary
    approach, I-Wood will pave the way for new paradigms in robotics and embodied
    AI, based on solutions that overcome the current animal-based or brain-based model,
    novel approaches for the use of robotics in biology and for new scientific knowledge
    on plants community with a major significance for biodiversity and climate protection.
