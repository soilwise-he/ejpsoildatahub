  title: Spatio-temporal assessment of integrating intermittent electricity in the
    EU and Western Balkans power sector under ambitious CO2 emission policies
  abstract: 'The main objective of the BECOOL (EU) and BioVALUE (Brazil) projects
    is to strengthen EU-Brazil cooperation on advanced lignocellulosic biofuels. Information
    alignment, knowledge synchronization, and synergistic activities on lignocellulosic
    biomass production logistics and conversion technologies are key targets of both
    projects and will bring mutual benefits.  Both projects are structured in 3 main
    pillars covering in a balanced way the whole range of activities of the biofuels
    value chain (biomass production, logistics, conversion and exploitation). The
    BECOOL consortium is composed by 14 partners from universities, research institutes,
    large industries/SMEs, from 7 EU countries. Together with improved logistics,
    the establishment of the BECOOL innovative cropping systems will enable to increase
    biomass feedstock availability by at least 50% without negatively impacting food
    production, soil quality, and customary land uses. The improvements in gasification
    process efficiency of new feedstocks will allow to achieve an optimal gas quality
    from non-conventional sources (e.g. lignocellulosic crops and residues). The use
    of energy carrier in gasification will allow to overcome a major logistics barriers
    for low-energy density feedstock, while the valorization of lignin-rich residues
    will dramatically improve the energy efficiency of the overall value chain. Technological
    breakthroughs on pre-treatment, hydrolysis and enzymatic saccharification and
    fermentation steps will increase the competitiveness of biochemical advanced ethanol.
    The cross-project model benchmarking, carried out between EU and Brazil, will
    decrease present limitations on growth, logistics and process academic models,
    making them more reliable, opening opportunities for business, new jobs, reduced
    land pressure, and enhanced environmental benefits in EU and Brazil.
