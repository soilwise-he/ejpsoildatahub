  title: In-depth Phylogenomic Analysis of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Based on a
    Comprehensive Set of de novo Genome Assemblies
  abstract: "Virtually all terrestrial plants depend on symbiotic interactions with\
    \ fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi evolved over 450 million years ago,\
    \ are obligate biotrophs and cannot complete their lifecycle without obtaining\
    \ carbon from host roots. Mediating nutrient uptake and sequestering carbon in\
    \ soil this symbiosis lie at the core of all terrestrial ecosystems. Plants on\
    \ the other hand are facultative mycotrophs but under natural conditions all host\
    \ roots are colonized as a result of multiple beneficial effects of AM fungi.\
    \ In the symbiosis, both plants and fungi are promiscuous, forming interactions\
    \ across individuals and species. In the absence of host-symbiont specificity\
    \ and given their inability to discriminate among partners prior to interaction,\
    \ evolutionary theory predicts that \u201Cfree riders\u201D would evolve and spread.\
    \ Yet AM fungi remain evolutionary and ecologically successful. I propose that\
    \ this is thanks to their unique genomic organization, a temporally dynamic heterokaryosis.Unlike\
    \ other eukaryotes, AM fungi have no single nucleate stage in their life cycle,\
    \ instead they reproduce asexually by forming large multinucleate spores. Genetic\
    \ variation is high and nuclei can migrate and mix within extensive mycelial networks.\
    \ My group has recently established a single nucleus genomics method to study\
    \ genetic variation among nuclei within AM fungi. With this method I can resolve\
    \ the extent of heterokaryosis in AM fungi and its temporal dynamics. I will study\
    \ the emergence of \u201Cfree riders\u201D upon intra organismal segregation of\
    \ genetically distinct nuclei during AM fungal adaptation to host. Further I will\
    \ study how hyphal fusion and nuclear mixing counteract segregation to stabilize\
    \ the symbiosis. The research program has great potential for novel discoveries\
    \ of fundamental importance to evolutionary and environmental biology and will\
    \ also contribute to agricultural practice and management of terrestrial ecosystems.\n"
