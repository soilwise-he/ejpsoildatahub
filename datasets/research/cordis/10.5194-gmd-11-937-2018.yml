  title: 'ORCHIDEE-SOM: modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon
    (DOC) dynamics along vertical soil profiles in Europe'
  abstract: "Lateral displacement of carbon (C) from soils across inland waters towards\
    \ the ocean has been intensified due to anthropogenic perturbations and has significant\
    \ influence on the anthropogenic C budget and the terrestrial C sink. However,\
    \ Earth System Models (ESM) which are used to simulate the terrestrial C sink\
    \ at global scale still ignore these lateral fluxes.The project presented here\
    \ aims at assessing the impact of lateral C fluxes on the anthropogenic CO2 budget\
    \ using a mechanistically-based approach. To this end, JULES, the land surface\
    \ component of the UK ESM, will be upgraded with an explicit representation of\
    \ fluvial transports of soil derived C, including decomposition of organic C in\
    \ transit and net C fluxes to the atmosphere and aquatic sediments. The model\
    \ will be calibrated, applied and validated at subcontinental scale for the UK,\
    \ but the technical developments will support future applications across scales,\
    \ from catchment to the globe. Historical simulations (1850-2010) will be run\
    \ to attribute climate change, land-use change mediated soil erosion, and river\
    \ damming to changes in C exports and C burial in aquatic sediments. Future simulation\
    \ (until 2100) under contrasting climate and land-use scenarios will be run in\
    \ order to assess the fate of the inland water C cycle.At the University of Exeter,\
    \ the fellow will gain experience in Earth System Modelling and improve his process\
    \ understanding of soil erosion, fluvial transport and sedimentation of C. This\
    \ combination of expertise will put the fellow into a unique position which meets\
    \ a clearly defined need in ESM development and increases his chance to obtain\
    \ a permanent position at a leading European research institute. This project\
    \ promotes the knowledge transfer in Earth System Modelling between the University\
    \ of Exeter (GB), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (F) and the Universit\xE9 Libre\
    \ de Bruxelles (Be) and the interdisciplinary exchange between climate science,\
    \ soil science and geomorphology.\n"
