  title: Tundra uptake of atmospheric elemental mercury drives Arctic mercury pollution
  abstract: "Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant of global concern for human and ecosystem\
    \ health. This is particularly true in the Arctic where indigenous populations\
    \ are excessively exposed to dietary Hg from fish and marine mammal consumption.\
    \ The deposition of Hg from the atmosphere to Earth surfaces and its re-emission\
    \ via biogeochemical reduction processes determine Hg concentrations in Earth\
    \ surface reservoirs, such as soils, snow, and runoff into Arctic lakes and surface\
    \ Ocean. In order to predict the impact of anthropogenic Hg emissions on net atmospheric\
    \ Hg deposition and ultimately Hg concentrations in biota, it is important to\
    \ understand these deposition and re-emission processes. The reduction of deposited\
    \ Hg2+ to volatile gaseous Hg0 and the oxidation of gaseous Hg0 to reactive Hg2+,\
    \ which is rapidly deposited from the atmosphere, control the global fate of Hg.\
    \ Major knowledge gaps concerning the mechanisms of these redox processes exist.\
    \ Different photochemical and non-photochemical Hg2+ reduction mechanisms were\
    \ found to fractionate Hg stable isotopes in distinct, identifiable ways. Also,\
    \ different atmospheric Hg0 and Hg2+ pools have been shown to have distinguishable\
    \ Hg isotope signatures. Hg isotopes can thus provide new insights in the sources\
    \ of Hg and redox transformation processes at the Earth-atmosphere interface,\
    \ which are inaccessible by means of concentration and flux measurements alone.\
    \ In the MEROXRE project proposed here we will combine the latest innovations\
    \ in gaseous Hg measurements in porous media (soils, snow) with state-of-the-art\
    \ Hg isotope techniques to investigate;(i)\tHg isotope fractionation of Hg2+ reduction\
    \ and gaseous Hg0 oxidation in interstitial snow air and soil pores. (ii)\tHg\
    \ isotope fractionation factors associated with net gaseous Hg0 re-emission fluxes\
    \ from soil and snow(iii)\tthe importance of gaseous Hg0 oxidation and Hg2+ reduction\
    \ and re-emission for the global Hg cycle by incorporating the results in a global\
    \ Hg isotope model.\n"
