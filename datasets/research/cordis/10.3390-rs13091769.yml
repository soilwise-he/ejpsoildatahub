  title: A Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline for Paddy Rice Classification Using
    Multi-Temporal Sentinel Data
  abstract: "ENVISION aims to fulfil the need for continuous and systematic monitoring\
    \ of agricultural land, shifting the focus from fragmented monitoring limited\
    \ to specific fields and dates to territory-wide and all-year-round monitoring.\
    \ It will make use of heterogeneous types of available data (EO-based, in situ,\
    \ open data, and historical on-field check data) and state-of-the-art technologies\
    \ and methodologies (automatic pixel/texture/object oriented change detection\
    \ and classification methods, machine learning, data fusion, multi-source and\
    \ multi-temporal data management) for providing a fully-automated and scalable\
    \ toolbox of services, built in close interaction with its future customers. ENVISION\
    \ will fully exploit the wealth of data made available through GEOSS and Copernicus\
    \ and its synergetic use with other data to develop data products such as; Cultivated\
    \ crop type maps; Soil Organic Carbon; Vegetation status; Crop growth (distinction\
    \ of organic \u2013 conventional farming); Grassland mowing/ploughing; Soil erosion.The\
    \ ENVISION toolbox will be comprised of; a monitoring service of sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices, tools that PAs & CBs can provide to farmers for adhering to environmentally\
    \ friendly agricultural practices, an Add-on Development Tool.The project will\
    \ be tested and validated in a pre-operational environment by potential future\
    \ customers of its products and services. ENVISION will have three categories\
    \ of business cases (Monitoring of; multiple environmental and climate requirements\
    \ of CAP, soil condition, organic farming requirements) and will also be tested\
    \ by a group of Lighthouse Customers.A market analysis, business model experimentation\
    \ techniques and appropriate decision-making tools will determine the commercially\
    \ viable business models for the services and products of ENVISION, and define\
    \ alternative business models, understand their implications and identify those\
    \ that will create the greatest value.\n"
