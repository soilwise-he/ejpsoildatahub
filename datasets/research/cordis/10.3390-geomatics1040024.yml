  title: Precipitation Data Retrieval and Quality Assurance from Different Data Sources
    for the Namoi Catchment in Australia
  abstract: "Shortages of freshwater will be one of the most pressing problems in\
    \ feeding the world this century. To optimize use of available water it is important\
    \ to distribute it wisely over the various competing interests, in particular\
    \ agriculture, which is responsible for 70% of all freshwater use. Irrigation\
    \ is currently often unsustainable, while groundwater reserves are becoming depleted\
    \ and many places in the world are suffering water shortages. Action is therefore\
    \ required now to use space and in-situ monitoring systems, to create a better\
    \ sense of water availability and optimise use across the planet. WaterSENSE will\
    \ provide water-availability and mapping services for any place in the world at\
    \ different time and space resolutions, based on integrated Copernicus data, hydrological\
    \ models and local data. The results of these services will be open access so\
    \ as to further develop value-adding services. WaterSENSE itself will deliver\
    \ the essential value-added service of monitoring compliance of local water use\
    \ against water rights and regulations (\u2018water auditing\u2019). The first\
    \ application will be in the multi-climate Murray-Darling Basin in Australia,\
    \ followed by validation in South Africa and the Netherlands. Consortium partners\
    \ already provide water-availability and water-auditing services in the latter\
    \ two countries. Novel research in the project will develop scalable information\
    \ services, based on advanced big-data processing algorithms, to determine variables\
    \ such as evapotranspiration, irrigation water use, rainfall and soil moisture,\
    \ as well as machine learning to allow automatic data processing and reduce uncertainty\
    \ in the hydrological variables determined. DIAS services for data provision,\
    \ as well as cloud hosting and processing of computational services, will be developed\
    \ and implemented. Existing successful partnership models will be refined to ensure\
    \ service providers in the water value chain achieve healthy business development.\n"
