  title: From saturated to unsaturated conditions and vice versa
  abstract: 'The proposal focusses on investigating the incorporation of microstructural
    aspects of soil fabric into an existing coupled mechanical and retention framework
    for saturated and unsaturated soils. Particular emphasis will be given to two
    challenging patterns of microstructural behaviour; (1) Soils exhibiting a highly
    directional-dependent response, as a consequence of a particular orientation of
    their internal structure (anisotropic behaviour); (2) Soils exhibiting large swelling
    deformations on wetting, as a consequence of the presence in the soil of highly
    expansive clay minerals (expansive behaviour). Both of these aspects are intimately
    related to the internal clay fabric (micro-level) and an improved understanding
    of the influences that the microstructural fraction has on the global soil response
    (macro-level) is central to the development of a novel constitutive model capable
    to represent comprehensively these advanced features of soil behaviour. Full implementation
    of such constitutive model into a finite element formulation will provide a unique
    computational tool from where practitioners and researchers will be able to assess,
    in a unified manner, simple and advanced geotechnical engineering applications
    involving both saturated and unsaturated soil behaviour. Effectively, the use
    of a more reliable material representation in geotechnical designs, by means of
    the implemented model, will facilitate a safer construction and serviceability
    of civil infrastructures supported on the ground while potentially reducing associated
    costs.
