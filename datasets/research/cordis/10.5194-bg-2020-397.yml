  title: "Reviews and Syntheses: Impacts of plant silica \xE2\u20AC\u201C herbivore\
    \ interactions on terrestrial biogeochemical \ncycling"
  abstract: 'Forests slow global climate change by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide
    but this ecosystem service is limited by soil nutrients. Herbivores potentially
    alter soil nutrients in a range of ways, but these have mostly only been recorded
    for large mammals. By comparison, the impacts of the abundant invertebrates in
    forests have largely been ignored and are not included in current models used
    to generate the climate predictions so vital for designing governmental policiesThe
    proposed project will use a pioneering new interdisciplinary approach to provide
    the most complete picture yet available of the rates, underlying drivers and ultimate
    impacts of key nutrient inputs from invertebrate herbivores across forest ecosystems
    worldwide. Specifically, we will;(1) Establish a network of herbivory monitoring
    stations across all major forest types, and across key environmental gradients
    (temperature, rainfall, ecosystem development).(2) Perform laboratory experiments
    to examine the effects of herbivore excreta on soil processes under different
    temperature and moisture conditions.(3) Integrate this information into a cutting-edge
    ecosystem model, to generate more accurate predictions of forest carbon sequestration
    under future climate change.The network established will form the foundation for
    a unique long-term global monitoring effort which we intend to continue long after
    the current funding time scale. This work represents a powerful blend of several
    disciplines harnessing an array of cutting edge tools to provide fundamentally
    novel insights into an area of direct and urgent importance for the society.
