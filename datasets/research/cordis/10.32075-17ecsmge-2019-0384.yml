  title: Comparison between energy and stress based pore pressure methods in liquefiable
    deposits
  abstract: "Over the past decade, earthquakes proved to be the deadliest of all European\
    \ disasters, with almost 19,000 fatalities and direct economic losses of approx.\
    \ \u20AC29 billion. Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible\
    \ for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences\
    \ from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss\
    \ was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously\
    \ a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength\
    \ of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being\
    \ known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence;\
    \ as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has\
    \ been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of\
    \ liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to\
    \ be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically.\
    \ A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction\
    \ on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction\
    \ mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably\
    \ translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility\
    \ of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure.\
    \ The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European\
    \ communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance\
    \ of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban\
    \ community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence. The LIQUEFACT\
    \ project sets out to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of EILDs, the\
    \ applications of the mitigation techniques, and the development of more appropriate\
    \ techniques tailored to each specific scenario, for both Europe and global.\n"
