  title: 'Water and nutrient management: the Austria case study of the FATIMA H2020
    project'
  abstract: 'FATIMA addresses effective and efficient monitoring and management of
    agricultural resources to achieve optimum crop yield and quality in a sustainable
    environment. It covers both ends of the scale relevant for food production, viz.,
    precision farming and the perspective of a sustainable agriculture in the context
    of integrated agri-environment management. It aims at developing innovative and
    new farm capacities that help the intensive farm sector optimize their external
    input (nutrients, water) management and use, with the vision of bridging sustainable
    crop production with fair economic competitiveness.Our comprehensive strategy
    covers five interconnected levels; a modular technology package (based on the
    integration of Earth observation and wireless sensor networks into a webGIS),
    a field work package (exploring options of improving soil and input management),
    a toolset for multi-actor participatory processes, an integrated multi-scale economic
    analysis framework, and an umbrella policy analysis set based on indicator-, accounting-
    and footprint approach.FATIMA addresses and works with user communities (farmers,
    managers, decision makers in the farm and agribusiness sector) at scales ranging
    from farm, over irrigation scheme or aquifer, to river-basins. It will provide
    them with maps of fertilizer and water requirements (to feed into precision farming
    machinery), crop water consumption and a range of further products for sustainable
    cropping management supported with innovative water-energy footprint frameworks.
    All information will be integrated in leading-edge participatory spatial online
    decision-support systems. The innovative FATIMA service concept considers the
    economic, environmental, technical, social, and political dimensions in an integrated
    way.FATIMA will be implemented and demonstrated in 8 pilot areas representative
    of key European intensive crop production systems in Spain, Italy, Greece, Netherlands,
    Czech Republic, Austria, France, Turkey.
