  title: Spartina alterniflora has the highest methane emissions in a St. Lawrence
    estuary salt marsh
  abstract: 'Coastal wetlands are globally important ecosystems providing valuable
    ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration over long timescales, affecting
    global carbon cycling and climate modulation. The amount of carbon sequestered,
    and therefore the net long-term global cooling potential of coastal marshes, however,
    is affected by complex biogeochemical reactions in marsh soils, which may produce
    and/or consume all three of the major greenhouse gases (GHGs) (carbon dioxide
    (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)). The magnitude and direction of
    these fluxes, and whether marsh soils act as a source or sink of GHGs, is affected
    by a variety of environmental factors which are predicted to vary with projected
    global change. MarshFlux, therefore, aims to address fundamental gaps in understanding
    of how the global cooling potential of coastal marshes will be affected by responses
    of biogeochemical reaction rates and GHG fluxes to global change. The effect of
    multiple drivers of global change on the response of GHG fluxes and key microbial
    processes for the consumption and production of N2O and CH4, will be investigated
    using a novel combination of laboratory incubations and mesocosm experiments.
    Laboratory incubation experiments mimicking modelled global change scenarios will
    be conducted to constrain the effects of drivers on marsh soil biogeochemical
    reaction rates and subsequent GHG dynamics, focusing on temperature, nutrient-loading
    and salinity. The results of these experiments, while critical themselves, will
    then inform mesocosm experiments to allow for the assessment of the whole ecosystem
    (soil, water and vegetation) response to global change under current and predicted
    future conditions. This research is critical for effective management of coastal
    wetlands to maintain their blue carbon value under future global change.
