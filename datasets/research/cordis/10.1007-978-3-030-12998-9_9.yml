  title: Towards the Commercialization of a Lab-on-a-Chip Device for Soil Nutrient
    Measurement
  abstract: "Today the application of fertilisers to agricultural crops is mainly\
    \ based on calculations, estimations and recommendations and not on analyses of\
    \ the actual demand of soil and plants. The resulting over-fertilisation has substantial\
    \ disadvantages; Farmers suffer from reduced yields and unnecessary expenses for\
    \ fertilisers, groundwater is polluted, surface water bodies are eutrophicated,\
    \ greenhouse gas is emitted from soils and finite natural fertiliser resources\
    \ are depleted. It is estimated that up to 35 % of the applied fertiliser could\
    \ be saved if a method for the quick and simple determination of the fertiliser\
    \ demand existed.Pessl GmbH, an Austrian SME specialised in the development of\
    \ innovative products in the field of agricultural monitoring and precision farming,\
    \ has developed MobiLab, a lab-on-a-chip sensor for the quick on-site determination\
    \ of the concentrations of the most important plant nutrients (ammonia, nitrate,\
    \ phosphate and potassium) in the soil, based on the outcomes of the award-winning\
    \ EU project OPTIFERT. MobiLab will enable farmers to determine the fertiliser\
    \ requirements of their fields within just a few minutes and without the need\
    \ for any special knowledge. The proper functioning and the great potentials of\
    \ the technology have been proven, but further technological developments as well\
    \ as the finalisation of a commercialisation concept are necessary to achieve\
    \ the market breakthrough. Based on the outcomes of phase 1 of the project, all\
    \ necessary steps for a successful market introduction of the MobiLab system will\
    \ be taken.The MobiLab nutrient sensor will help European farmers to save up to\
    \ 35 % of their applied fertiliser, leading to total potential annual savings\
    \ of up to 6 billion \u20AC on the EU level. At the same time, Pessl Instruments\
    \ GmbH will be able to significantly grow in terms of turnover, profit and employees\
    \ and to further expand its leading position on the world market for precision\
    \ farming products.\n"
