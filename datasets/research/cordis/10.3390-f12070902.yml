  title: "Aboveground Biomass Estimation in Short Rotation Forest Plantations in Northern\
    \ Greece Using ESA\u2019s Sentinel Medium-High Resolution Multispectral and Radar\
    \ Imaging Missions"
  abstract: "Marginal Lands (MLs) could offer suitable carbon sinks by afforestation/reforestation\
    \ projects without being competitive to food production, conforming to EU/Global\
    \ policies. The main objective of MAIL is to trigger utilization of MLs as Carbon\
    \ Sinks by activities related to forestry and agriculture. The project aims to\
    \ detect and classify mountainous and semimountainous Marginal Lands (m/sm MLs),\
    \ in order to deliver a web-based regional platform with data, methodology and\
    \ applications which will be valuable for policy makers, stakeholders or researchers.MAIL\
    \ will assess MLs\u2019 presence, distribution and suitability in smart and efficient\
    \ way, considering that marginality differs within European bioclimatic zones.\
    \ It will detect MLs through multiple layer analysis of existing EU/Global scale\
    \ datasets (land cover, land use, soil or climatic information, etc.) and will\
    \ further examine, validate and classify MLs, through field stratified sampling,\
    \ into Carbon sequestration capacity categories.In pilot areas MAIL will augment\
    \ the achieved accuracy by using enhanced spatial and radiometric resolution of\
    \ full free and open access satellite datasets. Furthermore, it will propose actions\
    \ that have to be taken in order to increase Carbon sequestration capacity and\
    \ it will evaluate their feasibility by using a set of criteria for accurate cost\
    \ estimation. Finally, it will deliver developed methodologies, algorithms and\
    \ techniques on a web-application platform for on-demand production of thematic\
    \ maps within Europe.MAIL consists by a multidisciplinary Consortium of 6 experienced\
    \ partners, from 4 EU Member States, and gathers the expertise required for identifying,\
    \ mapping and assessing MLs as a potential Carbon Sinks. The seconded staff will\
    \ exchange individual skills, competencies, thoughts, innovations, or ideas and\
    \ through collaboration will acquire new skills concerning MLs management and\
    \ will become more flexible, productive and efficient.\n"
