  title: 'Preclinical and Clinical Characteristics of the Trichuricidal Drug Oxantel
    Pamoate and Clinical Development Plans: A Review'
  abstract: 'To target helminth elimination, a drug research and development (R&D)
    pipeline is needed to provide new chemotherapeutics that effectively eliminate
    or sterilize adult worms, thus bringing about the paradigm shift necessary to
    reach the 2030 SDG goals on health. Our consortium proposes to establish a R&D
    pipeline for anthelminthics targeting nematodes. The focus will be on soil-transmitted
    helminthiasis and onchocerciasis, since these infections are among the leading
    neglected tropical diseases. Ground breaking characteristics of the drugs developed
    within our project are that they will have a unique mechanism of action that,
    at best, will target multiple nematodes (pan-nematode) with an excellent safety
    profile, including no efficacy against non-targeted co-endemic species. We will
    benefit from collaborations with our industrial partners Bayer and Celgene providing
    preselected compounds to populate the early preclinical stages of the R&D pipeline.
    Compounds with the best profile will be progressed through preclinical studies.
    Corallopyronin A, a compound with proven efficacy against essential Wolbachia
    endosymbionts in filariae that has superiority to the gold standard doxycycline,
    excellent bioavailability and promising exploratory safety data will undergo state-of-the-art
    toxicity profiling to advance towards phase 1 trials. We will also evaluate oxfendazol
    and oxantel pamoate in clinical trials. They have already proven efficacious in
    animals or humans and will only require clinical trials according to current regulatory
    guidelines to be implemented. With this strategy, the consortium will ensure that
    a pipeline of drug candidates is available for treating onchocerciasis, especially
    should current candidates fail in upcoming clinical trials. Moreover, we will
    establish a much-needed drug R&D pipeline to treat soil-transmitted helminth infections
    for which there is currently neither a drug with good efficacy against all species
    nor any prospects on the horizon.
