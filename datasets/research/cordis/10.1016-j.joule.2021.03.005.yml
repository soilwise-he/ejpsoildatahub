  title: Solar photovoltaics is ready to power a sustainable future
  abstract: "The sustainable development goals of the UN and climate targets of the\
    \ EU require that all economic sectors sharply reduce fossil-based use. However,\
    \ the agricultural sector has the potential to not only greatly defossilize, but\
    \ even produce energy \u2013 and that not to the detriment of, but alongside with\
    \ food production. Photovoltaic (PV) has become dramatically more competitive\
    \ relative to other renewable energy sources, and is now as competitive as wind\
    \ power. Currently, PV-parks are installed on large land areas, leading to loss\
    \ of land for cultivating crops. The ideal solution is provided by combined agro-voltaic\
    \ systems with dual land use for crop production and simultaneous power production.\
    \ HyPErFarm joins multiple types of actors with the objective to optimize viable\
    \ agrivoltaic business models as well as test the marketability of the products,\
    \ via inclusion of new innovative PV technologies (PV H2-production, bifacial\
    \ PV-panels), radically new crop production systems, stakeholder innovation workshops,\
    \ and citizen-consumer acceptance, public perception analysis and farmer adoption\
    \ studies. HyPErFarm also develops and demonstrates new ways of utilizing and\
    \ distributing the energy produced on-farm via heat pumps, e-robots, hydrogen\
    \ production, storage and use, and e-driven pyrolysis of biomass side-streams\
    \ that captures carbon while also improving soil quality. The project\u2019s impact\
    \ is that agrivoltaic systems are moved upwards to TRL7-8, and attractive new\
    \ business models are accessible for farmers. HyPErFarm thus supports a game-changing\
    \ radical innovation and contributes to the building of a low fossil-carbon, climate-resilient\
    \ future EU farming that can also supply local communities with power and hydrogen.\
    \ HyPErFarm partners have the ability to adopt and further develop the new farming\
    \ practices, to provide the new technologies required, and to adopt new APV-business\
    \ models that will allow continued food production on land used for power production.\n"
