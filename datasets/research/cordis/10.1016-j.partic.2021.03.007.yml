  title: GPU-enhanced DEM analysis of flow behaviour of irregularly shaped particles
    in a full-scale twin screw granulator
  abstract: 'River pollution has become a serious environmental problem in the Europe
    and worldwide as it dramatically affects the freshwater quality and human health.
    A major source of chemical and physical pollution in rivers is small particles
    known as fine-grained sediment (FGS). Intensified agricultural practices and the
    associated increase in soil erosion in Europe has caused a shape increase in the
    supply of FGS to water streams. Consequently, the water quality in many rivers
    in Europe have deteriorated and are failing to meet minimum water quality standards.
    Hence, there is a urgent need to address the river pollution problem through a
    thorough understanding on how much supplied FGS infiltrates into the river bed
    and how much is resuspended and migrated at different hydrodynamic conditions,
    i.e. the dynamics of FGS. MULTIPIR takes an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle
    this challenge heads-on by combining the extraordinary experience of the researcher
    in erosion, sand production, hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
    with the expertise of the supervisor in coupled discrete element methods with
    CFD (DEM-CFD) and solid-liquid flows. A combined experimental and numerical investigation
    on the migration of FGS in the river will be performed, from which multiscale
    models will be developed to predict the infiltration and re-suspension of FGS
    at the microscopic level and the transport of FGS at different hydraulic conditions
    at the macroscopic scale. Using the developed model, a river pollution control
    map will be developed to guide the river managements. It is for the first time
    that advanced engineering approaches, e.g. DEM-CFD and advanced imaging techniques,
    are employed to address the challenging environmental problem and to develop a
    science-based river pollution control strategy that can benefit European citizens
    and beyond.
