  title: Organic matter influences transformation products of ferrihydrite exposed
    to sulfide
  abstract: "IRMIDYN will study the dynamics of redox-driven iron mineral transformation\
    \ processes in soils and sediments and impacts on nutrient and trace element behavior\
    \ using a novel approach based on enriched stable isotopes (e.g., 57Fe, 33S, 67Zn,\
    \ 113Cd, 198Hg) in combination with innovative experiments and cutting-edge analytical\
    \ techniques, most importantly 57Fe M\xF6ssbauer and Raman micro-spectroscopy\
    \ and imaging. The thermodynamic stability and occurrence of iron minerals in\
    \ sufficiently stable Earth surface environments is fairly well understood and\
    \ supported by field observations. However, the kinetics of iron mineral recrystallization\
    \ and transformation processes under rapidly changing redox conditions is far\
    \ less understood, and has to date mostly been studied in in mixed reactors with\
    \ pure minerals or sediment slurries, but rarely in-situ in complex soils and\
    \ sediments. Thus, we do not know if and how fast certain iron mineral recrystallization\
    \ and transformation processes observed in the laboratory actually occur in soils\
    \ and sediments, and which environmental factors control the transformation rates\
    \ and products. Redox-driven iron mineral recrystallization and transformation\
    \ processes are key to understanding the biogeochemical cycles of C, N, P, S,\
    \ and many trace elements (e.g., As, Zn, Cd, Hg, U). In face of current global\
    \ challenges caused by massive anthropogenic changes in biogeochemical cycles\
    \ of nutrients and toxic elements, it is paramount that we begin to understand\
    \ and quantify the dynamics of these processes in-situ and learn how we can apply\
    \ our mechanistic (but often reductionist) knowledge to the natural environment.\
    \ This project will take a large step toward a better understanding of iron mineral\
    \ dynamics in redox-affected Earth surface environments, with wide implications\
    \ in biogeochemistry and other fields including environmental engineering, corrosion\
    \ sciences, archaeology and cultural heritage sciences, and planetary sciences.\n"
