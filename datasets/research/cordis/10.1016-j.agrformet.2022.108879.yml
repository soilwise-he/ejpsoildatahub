  title: Severe drought can delay autumn senescence of silver birch in the current
    year but advance it in the next year
  abstract: "Leaf phenology is a key component in the functioning of temperate and\
    \ boreal deciduous forests. The environmental cues for bud-burst in spring are\
    \ well known, but little is known about the cues controlling the timing of leaf\
    \ fall in autumn. Leaf fall is the last stage of leaf senescence, a process which\
    \ allows trees to recover leaf nutrients. We urgently need to understand the controls\
    \ timing leaf senescence to improve our projections of forest growth and climate\
    \ change. I propose a new general paradigm of the onset of leaf senescence, hypothesizing\
    \ that leaf senescence is triggered by the cessation of tree growth in autumn.\
    \ I expect that; (i) in the absence of growth-limiting environmental conditions,\
    \ tree growth cessation directly controls leaf-senescence onset; and (ii) in the\
    \ presence of growth-limiting conditions, photoperiod controls leaf-senescence\
    \ onset \u2013 this prevents trees from starting to senesce too early. I will\
    \ test these hypotheses with a combination of; (i) manipulative experiments on\
    \ young trees - these will disentangle the impact of photoperiod from that of\
    \ other factors affecting tree growth cessation, namely; temperature, drought\
    \ and soil nutrient availability; (ii) monitoring leaf senescence and growth in\
    \ mature forest stands; (iii) comparing the leaf senescence dynamics of four major\
    \ tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, Betula pendula and Populus tremula)\
    \ in four European locations spanning from 40\xBA to 70\xBA N; and (iv) integrating\
    \ the new paradigm into a model of forest ecosystem dynamics and testing it for\
    \ the major forested areas of Europe. The aim is to solve the conundrum of the\
    \ timing of leaf senescence in temperate and boreal deciduous trees, provide a\
    \ new interpretation of the relationship between leaf senescence, tree growth\
    \ and environment, and deliver a modelling tool able to predict leaf senescence\
    \ and tree growth, for projections of forest biomass production and climate change.\n"
