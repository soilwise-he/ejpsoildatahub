  title: 'Alternatives to Cu Applications in Viticulture: How R&D Projects Can Provide
    Applied Solutions, Helping to Establish Legislation Limits'
  abstract: "The DIRECTIVE 2009/128/EC ON THE SUSTAINABLE USE OF PESTICIDES gives\
    \ directions for attaining the sustainable use of pesticides in the EU. The objective\
    \ is to minimize risks and impacts for the environment and human health by promoting\
    \ alternative strategies. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is one of the cornerstones\
    \ of the Directive. NOVATERRA aims to reduce the use and negative impacts of CONTENTIOUS\
    \ PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCTS (PPP) for integrated pest, disease and weed management\
    \ in the two main Mediterranean crops in Europe; grapevines and olives. NOVATERRA\
    \ will develop a pool of novel, integrated and sustainable strategies, technically\
    \ and economically viable, resulting from three different approaches; a) To develop\
    \ novel combinations of ALTERNATIVE, non-synthetic PRODUCTS and biological control\
    \ techniques for plant protection, b) To optimize the application and dosage of\
    \ PPP through SMART FARMING technologies and c) To mitigate the appearance of\
    \ pest and diseases through the use of new SOIL MANAGEMENT strategies. Those approaches\
    \ will be evaluated and validated in a combination of integrated solutions for\
    \ updating and improving IPM strategies. Indicators for measuring the impact of\
    \ crop management and protection on human health, air, water, soil, biodiversity,\
    \ energy will be implemented. Further analyses will be done in terms of economic\
    \ cost-benefit for farmers to adopt the different techniques and farmers and consumers\u2019\
    \ willingness to pay. The consortium composition will guarantee a multi-actor\
    \ approach with contributions coming from research institutions, growers, technological\
    \ SMEs, auxiliary industry and relevant associations. Finally, the Exploitation\
    \ Plan together with the Communication and Dissemination Plan will ensure the\
    \ outreach of results among the stakeholders in the European farming sector. NOVATERRA\
    \ outputs will also be key for further discussion with policymakers in terms of\
    \ EU plant health policies and risk assessment around PPPs usage.\n"
