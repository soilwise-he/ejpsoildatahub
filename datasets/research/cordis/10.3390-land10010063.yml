  title: Evaluation of a Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems Spectral Sensor for Soil
    Properties Estimation
  abstract: "DIONE proposes a close-to-market (TRL7) area-based direct payments monitoring\
    \ toolbox that will address the forthcoming Modernised CAP regulation of using\
    \ automated technologies to ensure more frequent, accurate and inexpensive compliance\
    \ checks. In particular, DIONE will;(i) Capitalise on recent results of ESA\u2019\
    s SEN4CAP project that showcased the capability of Sentinel  data to monitor the\
    \ crop diversification rules. DIONE shall further integrate generated crop-type\
    \ maps in a way directly exploitable by the paying agencies;(ii) Include in the\
    \ analysis the so far neglected EFA types (fallow land of all sizes, buffer strips,\
    \ hedges, trees), by making use of super-resolution technology that improves the\
    \ 10-20m Sentinel resolution to an improved resolution range (5-10m). This is\
    \ enabled through Machine-Learning (ML) based post-processing and data fusion\
    \ of Copernicus DIAS-sourced data with targeted drone-obtained data. This aims\
    \ to motivate the use of such EFAs over the \u2013of ambiguous environmental impact-\
    \ use of productive areas (nitrogen-fixing crops and catch crops). (iii) Complement\
    \ the use of EO data with a system of reliable, ground-based geo-tagged photos,\
    \ captured by the farmers that exploits (a) advances that allow for improved positional\
    \ accuracy, (ii) low-footprint encryption techniques for improved data security\
    \ and reliability and (iii) image detecting manipulation techniques (image forensics).\
    \ The system will allow for an improved LC/LU annotation and ensure the process\
    \ is untampered.(iv) Implement a Green Compliance toolbox, integrated with the\
    \ paying agencies\u2019 aforementioned tools. This will benefit from (a) low-cost\
    \ spectral sensors measuring soil quality and assessing the status of land-degradation\
    \ in the land parcels and (b) an ML-based inferencing system deployed on a larger\
    \ scale (regional, national) to quantify the levels of some of the monitored parameters\
    \ and consequently extract tangible environmental performance metrics for an entire\
    \ region\n"
