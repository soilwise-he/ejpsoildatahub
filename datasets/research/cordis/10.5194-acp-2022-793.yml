  title: Trends and seasonal variability of ammonia across major biomes inferred from
    long-term series of ground-based and satellite measurements
  abstract: "The overall objective of the INSA (Integrated Nitrogen Studies in Africa)\
    \ project is to work on different aspects of the nitrogen budget in Africa, with\
    \ interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary competences, based on a network of scientists\
    \ from Europe and Africa. An essential output of this project will be to create\
    \ an interoperable platform on N topics to a large public including academics\
    \ and stakeholders, and to increase the awareness of challenges, risks and chances\
    \ for a better N management in Africa.According to the \u201CMelbourne Declaration\
    \ on Responsible Nitrogen Management for a Sustainable Future\u201D (December\
    \ 2016), \u201CNitrogen management should strive to simultaneously improve the\
    \ efficiency of nitrogen use, increase farm productivity, enhance soil health,\
    \ conserve resources and reduce losses of reactive nitrogen to the environment\u201D\
    . The INSA network will bring its contribution to this great subject of study,\
    \ and participate to drive the development of a preliminary N assessment in Africa.\
    \ Many international networks of scientists already exist between countries inside\
    \ and outside Africa. However, for the first time, it is proposed to link these\
    \ activities in a large and sustainable network to enhance high quality and multidisciplinary\
    \ research focused on nitrogen in Africa. This network will gather scientists\
    \ from Europe and Africa working on ecology, atmospheric chemistry, water quality,\
    \ soil science, biogeochemistry, agriculture and livestock. The interdisciplinary\
    \ competences of the groups involved in INSA will help in developing innovative\
    \ aspects of research on targeted questions, to sustain a dialogue between different\
    \ communities of researchers, to transfer information to the public and to reinforce\
    \ educational activities. Education and information sharing with a large public\
    \ will help to disseminate the message of how a sustainable use of nitrogen in\
    \ our environment is the key action to mitigate harmful impacts while assuring\
    \ food security.\n"
