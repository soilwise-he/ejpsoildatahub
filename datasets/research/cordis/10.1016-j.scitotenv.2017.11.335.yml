  title: 'Soil and land use research in Europe: Lessons learned from INSPIRATION bottom-up
    strategic research agenda setting'
  abstract: "The aim of INSPIRATION is to adopt a funder and end-user demand-driven\
    \ approach to establish and promote the adoption of the knowledge creation, transfer\
    \ and implementation agenda for land use, land-use changes and soil management\
    \ in the light of current and future societal challenges. Main objectives are;\
    \ \u2022 Formulate, consult on and revise an end-user oriented strategic research\
    \ agenda (SRA), \u2022 Scope out models of implementing the SRA, \u2022 Prepare\
    \ a network of public and private funding institutions willing to commonly fund\
    \ the execution of the SRA. INSPIRATION\u2019s mission is to improve the supply\
    \ and effectiveness of science/knowledge take-up by those who really need it.\
    \ The proposed methodology is based on a multi-stakeholder, multi-national and\
    \ interdisciplinary approach that covers the variety of stakeholders (public bodies,\
    \ business, science, citizens and society) and the variety of relevant. The vehicle\
    \ to engage with all relevant stakeholders across the Member States is a National\
    \ Focal Point (NFP) in 16 countries. The NFP\u2019s will organize workshops with\
    \ national stakeholders of funders, end users and researchers across the various\
    \ soil and land management disciplines. The results will be taken up, structured\
    \ along four integrative themes and merging into thematic knowledge needs to satisfy\
    \ the as yet unmet societal challenges and to ensure that knowledge contributes\
    \ primarily to enable meeting these challenges. Based on these results a cross\
    \ country and cross discipline dialogue will subsequently be organized among the\
    \ relevant user communities, funding bodies and scientific communities in Europe\
    \ in order to reach a trans-national, prioritized SRA as well as a model for execution\
    \ of this SRA. Thus to achieve an SRA of which national funders believe that for\
    \ any Euro they spend, they will get a multitude of Euro\u2019s worth of knowledge\
    \ in return. Knowledge welcomed to face their national, societal challenges.\n"
