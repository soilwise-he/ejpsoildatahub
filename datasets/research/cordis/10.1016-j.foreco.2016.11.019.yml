  title: Survival and growth as measures of shade tolerance of planted western redcedar,
    western hemlock and amabilis fir seedlings in hemlock-fir forests of northern
    Vancouver Island
  abstract: "European forestry is fast evolving as forests could experience in the\
    \ near future important changes in climate and also in management, which is moving\
    \ from timber production to values such as bioenergy, carbon sequestration, biodiversity\
    \ and others. These factors could change the idoneity of traditional forestry\
    \ in Scots pine forests (which cover important areas in Europe). The project\xB4\
    s objectives are; 1) To characterize past and estimate future effects of forest\
    \ management and climate change on carbon and nutrient budgets in Pinus sylvestris\
    \ stands in SW Europe, to support sustainable forestry that maximizes nutrient\
    \ and carbon use efficiency and therefore tree growth; 2) To develop, evaluate\
    \ and apply reliable ecologically-based mathematical models that can be applied\
    \ in forest management, to study interactions among elevated atmospheric CO2,\
    \ tree growth and limiting nutrients and moisture. To achieve these objectives\
    \ the project will be implemented in three stages; 1) Field and archival samples\
    \ form experimental plots in Scot pine stands in the Pyrenees will be used to\
    \ analyze connections between soil, leaf and stem nutrient status in the last\
    \ 16 years. The magnitude of ecosystem biomass and nutrient pools will be estimated\
    \ to calculate the historical change of nutrient use efficiency by the pines.\
    \ Historical leaf NUE will be estimated through leaf area scanning combined with\
    \ chemical analysis. Stem water and nutrient status will be estimated by wood\
    \ scanning combined with techniques discriminating isotopes of carbon and nitrogen.\
    \ 2) The ecosystem model FORECAST-Climate will be calibrated, validated, and used\
    \ as a virtual lab to test the relative importance of nutrient, water, and CO2\
    \ availability on tree growth. 3) A battery of climate change (temperature, precipitation\
    \ and CO2 concentration) and forest management scenarios will be simulated to\
    \ assess their long-term consequences and provide guidelines on the potential\
    \ consequences of each management option.\n"
