  abstract: 'The WATERAGRI vision is to solve agricultural water management and soil
    fertilisation challenges in a sustainable manner to secure affordable food production
    in Europe for the 21st century. The WATERAGRI concept aims to introduce a new
    framework for the use of affordable small water retention approaches for managing
    excess and shortage of water as well as better recovery of nutrients from agricultural
    catchments applying a multi-actor approach. The objectives are to(a) Co-develop
    (multi-actor approach) the links between agricultural land and soil-sediment-water
    management for improved management of water excess and shortage, maximizing crop
    production and improving water quality and nutrient uptake by crops;(b) Undertake
    both technical and sustainability assessments of proposed measures considering
    tested and reviewed management options;(c) Develop a cloud-based simulation and
    data assimilation system based on a physically-based terrestrial system model,
    which is able to assimilate in situ and remotely sensed observations of hydrological
    and plant variables and meteorological data in near-real time to analyse effects
    of structures such as drains and dams for improved farm-scale water management
    and retention;(d) Identify, develop and test affordable and easy-to-implement
    long-term technical and operational farm solutions such as controlled drainage,
    regulated deficit irrigation, subsurface irrigation, groundwater recharge, farm
    constructed wetlands, soil management and nutrient recovery options;(e) Assess
    the techniques for their potential regarding adaptation to climate change and
    their impact on ecosystem services for different biogeographic regions using case
    studies; and(f) Disseminate the implemented innovations to farmers, advisory services
    and decision-makers as part of a multi-actor approach.The key performance indicators
    are increased crop production, enhanced nutrient recovery from streams and a simulation
    and data assimilation system.
