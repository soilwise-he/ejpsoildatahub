  abstract: 'The overall objective of WIDER UPTAKE is to co-develop a roadmap for
    widespread implementation of water smart symbiotic solutions for wastewater reuse
    and resource recovery, based on the principles of circular economy. WIDER UPTAKE
    will demonstrate innovative solutions that optimize water reuse, resource recovery
    and energy utilisation where market utilisation of the recovered resource(s) is
    achieved through a symbiosis between the utility and industry. The cases will
    provide applied knowledge on operationalization of the solutions, shared and further
    co-developed in a community of practice. The demonstrations are;- Reuse of wastewater
    for urban agriculture, Ghana.- Fertiliser and soil improver by wastewater resource
    recovery, Norway.- Reuse of wastewater for greening of urban areas, Czech Republic.-
    Reuse of wastewater for irrigation in agricultural industry, Italy.- Production
    of new bio-composite material by water resource recovery, Netherlands.WIDER UPTAKE''s
    hypothesis is that the barriers for wider uptake of water-smart solutions are
    not only technological but also of organizational, regulatory, social and economic
    character. WIDER UPTAKE will identify and demonstrate common measures for wider
    uptake through activities on ''Monitoring and control of health and quality risks'',
    ''Circular-economy and efficiency potential'', ''Governance and business models
    for industrial symbiosis'' and ''Measuring water smartness and progress towards
    SDG''. WIDER UPTAKE includes demonstrations of wastewater reuse for agriculture
    and urban greening, which also reduces the impact of warming from climate change.
    WIDER UPTAKE also comprises cases with phosphorus recycling, biogas and biochar
    utilisation, and production of bio-composites for manufacturing materials with
    resources recovered from the whole water cycle, which demonstrates the upcycling
    of the resources from wastewater to marketable products.
