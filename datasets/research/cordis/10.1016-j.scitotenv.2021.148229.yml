  title: Long-term multi-endpoint exposure of the microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata
    to lanthanum and cerium
  abstract: 'As Rare Earth Elements (REE) are crucial to a wide range of modern technologies
    regards to their unique properties, Europe expands its ability to obtain these
    strategic REE resources. Thus, several research and industrial projects were recently
    dedicated to the identification of potential REE stocks in Europe. However, the
    environmental risk exerted by the REE dissemination has so far received very little
    attention although disruptions of some REE biogeochemical cycles have been already
    evidenced. In that context, intensive and cooperative intersectoral researches
    are needed on REE environmental occurrence, behaviour, fate and their respective
    effects on natural resources (soils, waters and biota) and human health. The PANORAMA
    project is a unique multi- and interdisciplinary project aiming at (i) investigating
    the whole REE environmental behaviour including the characterization of sources,
    speciations and transfers throughout the different environmental compartments
    and sensu lato associated effects onto environmental health, as well as (ii) gaining
    valuable knowledge for applications in friendly environmental REE life cycle.
    For the 1st time PANORAMA gathers the competencies of (geo)chemists, (hydro)geologists
    and (eco)toxicologists, working in 14 academic and 4 private partners to enroll
    and train 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs). The project will combine training
    and cutting-edge research tools through coupled field/ analytical/experimental/modeling
    approaches. The strong blend of academic and non-academic sectors in the consortium
    will give the ESRs a unique chance to develop a wide set of fundamental research,
    technical and transferable skills (e.g. research integrity, communication and
    dissemination, career development and innovative technology), thus preparing them
    for long-time employment in either the academic, industrial, commercial or policy
    sectors and pave the way for high-level long-standing intersectoral collaborations
    within a European framework.
