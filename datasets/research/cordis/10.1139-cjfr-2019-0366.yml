  title: How random are predictions of forest growth? The importance of weather variability
  abstract: 'Understanding soil processes and their role in ecosystem functioning
    is essential for effective protection, restoration and sustainable use of soils
    and terrestrial ecosystems. Forest ecosystem models dynamically simulate fluxes
    of carbon, water, nitrogen and other nutrients through a forest ecosystem. Only
    models that account for all key interactions between climate, soil and plants
    can become versatile and reliable tools to predict the effect of different management
    strategies or future global changes on forests and soils. The effect of soil fauna
    has been so far neglected in most of similar models. However, with our increasing
    understanding of the crucial role of fauna on many processes, there is a general
    consensus on the need to implement these effects into ecosystem models. The main
    research question of this project is; Does a model that includes an active role
    of soil fauna provide better prediction of soil processes than previous simpler
    models?  ANAFORE is a stand-scale mechanistic forest model with a detailed soil
    model. The specific objectives of this project are 1) to develop a new soil submodel
    that will account for important effects of soil fauna on the simulated fluxes
    of water, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; and integrate it into the ANAFORE model.
    The modeled effects include fragmentation, bioturbation, aggregation, macropore
    formation and foodweb effects on soil organic matter decomposition, 2) to optimize
    and validate the new model using; i) historical experimental data obtained during
    long-term research at Sokolov post-mining ecosystems LTER site, ii) additional
    literature and original data collected during the project for modelling purposes;
    3) to compare performance of the new ANAFORE soil submodel with the previous version
    of ANAFORE and the Yasso model as an example of a simple model that predicts organic
    matter decomposition only based on litter quality and abiotic factors.
