  title: Microbiome approaches provide the key to biologically control postharvest
    pathogens and storability of fruits and vegetables
  abstract: 'Excalibur plans to deepen the knowledge on soil biodiversity dynamics
    and its synergistic effects with prebiotic and probiotic approaches in horticulture,
    using a multi-actor approach. To pursue this aim, new multifunctional soil microbial
    inoculants (bio-inocula) and bio-effectors will be tested on three model crops
    of economic importance (es. tomato, apple, strawberry) under different experimental
    and open-field conditions across Europe, and the feed-feedback effect of/on native
    biodiversity monitored. In order to go beyond the multitude of studies on the
    links between soil biodiversity and plant health, Excalibur will develop a comprehensive
    strategy of soil management improving the effectiveness of biocontrol and biofertilization
    practices in agriculture. For this purpose Excalibur plans to; 1) focus on multiscale
    interactions between plants and belowground organisms to exploit the potential
    of multifunctional bio-inocula and bio-effectors; 2) optimize the formulation
    and the application methods of these products based on native soil biodiversity
    dynamics; 3) develop a strategy to improve the exploitation of soil biodiversity
    interactions with bio-effectors and bio-inocula by assessing their impacts on
    crops and biodiversity under contrasting agricultural management practices (conventional,
    organic) and biotic/abiotic stress conditions; 4) to build a multi-criteria model
    to assess soil biodiversity status of cropping systems for a more efficient use
    of bio-effectors and bio-inocula; 5) develop technical tools to monitor the persistence
    and dispersion of bio-inocula under field conditions for eco-toxicological and
    agronomical purposes; 6) evaluate the effects of the new strategy on economy,
    environment quality and ecosystem functions; 7) disseminate results to all stakeholders
    with a dynamic and comprehensive methodology and encourage the adoption of best
    practices derived from the new strategy at local, regional and global level.
