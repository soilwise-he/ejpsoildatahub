  title: Can a buried gas pipeline experience local buckling during earthquake ground
    shaking?
  abstract: 'EXCHANGE-Risk is an Intersectoral/International Research and Innovation
    staff exchange scheme between academia and the industry in Europe and North America
    focusing on mitigating Seismic Risk of buried steel pipeline Networks that are
    subjected to ground-imposed permanent deformations. It also aims at developing
    a Decision Support System for the Rapid Pipeline Recovery to minimize the time
    required for inspection and rehabilitation in case of a major earthquake. EXCHANGE-Risk
    involves novel hybrid experimental and numerical work of the soil-pileline system
    at a pipe, pipeline and network level integrated with innovative technologies
    for rapid pipe inspection. The outcome of the project is a series of well targeted
    exchanges between the partners (involving more than 30 early stage and experienced
    researchers) within a well defined framework of innovation that ensures transfer
    of knowledge between the academia and the industry, Europe and North America as
    well wide dissemination of the methodologies and tools developed to the engineering
    community.
