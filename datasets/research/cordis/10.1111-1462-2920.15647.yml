  title: "\u2018Cry\u2010for\u2010help\u2019 in contaminated soil: a dialogue among\
    \ plants and soil microbiome to survive in hostile conditions"
  abstract: 'Phyto-rhyzo-remediation is a promising technology for pollutant clean-up
    provided by the plant holobiont, composed by the host plant and its microbiota.
    Plant root exudation is modulated by the pollution stress and has a key role in
    the activation of the microbial degrading metabolism. Despite the well documented
    role of the plant holobiont in ecosystem services, the complex interactions between
    host and microbiome are poorly understood, in particular in contaminated environments.
    SENSE is an innovative, interdisciplinary approach to sort out the time-spatial
    synergistic interplay within the plant holobiont components and the geochemistry
    of rhizosphere micro-niches supporting microbial degradation. The project will
    take place in a top-rated Italian research university and spans metabolomic techniques,
    biosensors, together with an original application of microsensor/sensor devices
    to profile the chemistry of the root microenvironments. The study will be applied
    to one of the largest sites in Europe contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls
    (PCB), located in Italy. The research will be approached from two complementary
    angles; i) set up and application of bacterial biosensors to examine topology
    and dynamics of activation of the PCB degradation pathways upon stimulation by
    identified plant root exudates; ii) sensing the plant-modulated chemical micro-habitats
    through microsensor/sensor devices during plant-microbe interaction under PCBs
    stress. This will provide a proof of concept for the role of root exudates as
    boost of soil microbiome degradative potential. SENSE outcomes will provide a
    comprehensive understanding of the plant holobiont applied to environmental biotechnology,
    representing an opportunity for Europe to keep its leadership in research and
    green biotechnology. Additionally, this project will significantly enhance my
    skills and capabilities as experienced researcher in microbial and plant-sciences,
    to become a leader in this field
