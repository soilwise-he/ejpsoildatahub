  title: Extreme freeze-thaw cycles do not affect moss-associated nitrogen fixation
    across a temperature gradient, but affect nutrient loss from mosses
  abstract: 'Plant productivity in pristine ecosystems like boreal and tropical cloud
    forests is limited by soil nutrients, primarily nitrogen (N). Mosses are major
    contributors to ecosystem productivity in these habitats, and most of them are
    colonized by N2-fixing cyanobacteria, thereby providing N to the ecosystem. Despite
    this key role, critical knowledge gaps exist. In particular, the climatic controls
    of moss-associated N2 fixation remain unclear, limiting our ability to quantify
    and project climate change effects on this fundamental ecosystem function. Further,
    it is unknown whether mosses and associated cyanobacteria share a mutualistic
    (both partners benefit) or parasitic (one partner benefits at the expense of the
    other) relationship. Yet, the balance of this association is crucial for maintaining
    ecosystem productivity. I will combine field, laboratory and modelling approaches
    to fill these knowledge gaps by addressing 4 objectives. I will (1) identify the
    climatic controls of N2 fixation in mosses from contrasting ecosystems; boreal
    forests and tropical cloud forests, (2) ascertain the degree of mutualism or parasitism
    between moss and cyanobacteria using transcriptomics, (3) determine nutrient exchange
    rates between moss and cyanobacteria using nanoSIMS. The ultimate goal is (4)
    to model ecosystem N input via N2 fixation in boreal and tropical ecosystems.  In
    SYMBIONIX, I will uniquely combine biogeochemistry with ecology across scales,
    offering a break-through in ecosystem research. Application of cutting-edge methods
    will enable progress previously unachievable in ecosystem ecology. I will interlink
    a vital ecosystem function to its molecular and ecological foundation. A synthesis
    will be achieved via the parameterization and validation of global circulation
    models, resulting in improved predictions of ecosystem nutrient cycling in a future
    climate. Targeted combination of cross-scale approaches will make this initiative
    field-leading in ecosystem ecology.
