  title: 'GRQA: Global River Water Quality Archive'
  abstract: 'A growing economy and population in the world is causing landscape changes
    and an increasing pressure is put on water resources. Diffuse water pollution
    is considered to be one of the major problems for water quality in many countries.
    Modelling has been successfully used to simulate water quality in catchments to
    better understand the underlying landscape processes. The widely used Soil and
    Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a spatially distributed model that can be used
    to estimate flow and nutrient transport at a variety of scales.In current published
    studies typically only one or two parameters of precipitation, DEM, land use or
    soil properties are used in. The proposed project aims to investigate how spatial
    resolution of core input datasets of all types (precipitation, DEM, land use and
    soil) impacts SWAT modelling results and estimate the nutrient runoff on a local
    and global scale.Sensitivity analysis to all of precipitation, DEM, land use and
    soil will therefore be tested. The limitation to one or two parameters in current
    published studies is due to the computational demands. Due to the way the SWAT
    model is programmed using a tightly coupled Message Passing Interface (MPI) approaches
    the available computing power needs to accessible within specialised High Performance
    Computing (HPC) clusters of limited size. Thus, either scale or resolution is
    typically compromised.As for higher resolution or global scale data the computational
    effort becomes too large for automated calibration, we aim to develop a novel
    method to automate data processing and balancing computational load transparently
    between many computers.In order to surpass these limitations we test the MapReduce
    framework as a novel method for parallelization. This entails new ways of data
    management, model data partitioning and spreading the model partition computations
    transparently over multiple computing nodes  fostering a loosely coupled distributed
    computation paradigm.
