  title: 'Thermal Submeso Motions in the Nocturnal Stable Boundary Layer. Part 2:
    Generating Mechanisms and Implications'
  abstract: "Surface meteorology impacts the abundance and quality of life on Earth\
    \ through the transfer and mixing of light, heat, water, CO2, and other substances\
    \ controlling the resources for humans, plants, and animals. However, current\
    \ theories and models fail when airflows and turbulence are weak during calm nights\
    \ leaving weather and climate forecasts uncertain. This \u2018dark side\u2019\
    \ occupies substantial fractions of time and our landscape, its physics are largely\
    \ unknown, and has eluded proper experimental investigation.DarkMix creates technological\
    \ and theoretical innovations to observe and explain transport and mixing in the\
    \ weak-wind boundary layer. Its ambitious goal is a radically new framework incorporating\
    \ unexplored mechanisms such as submeso-scale motions, flow instationarities,\
    \ and directional shear to effect a quantum leap in understanding the air-plant-soil\
    \ exchange. DarkMix will build the ground-breaking first-ever fiber-optic distributed\
    \ temperature sensing harp to fully resolve the 3-dimensional flow and air temperature\
    \ fields and enable unprecedented computation of eddy covariance fluxes at scales\
    \ of seconds over 4 orders of magnitude (deci- to hundreds of meters). Both key\
    \ innovations bear significant risks of technical and fundamental nature, which\
    \ are mitigated by pursuing alternatives. Measurements will inform cutting-edge\
    \ large eddy simulations to test hypotheses. The interdisciplinary dimension takes\
    \ DarkMix to a unique set of weak-wind sites including a valley-bottom grassland,\
    \ a forest in complex terrain, and a city to investigate topographic effects,\
    \ the forest carbon cycle, and the urban heat island.DarkMix will open a new window\
    \ for surface meteorology and its links to air quality, biogeochemistry, and climate\
    \ change by giving physically meaningful and societally relevant answers to profound\
    \ questions such as the exchange of greenhouse gases, hazards from ground fog,\
    \ urban pollution, and agricultural losses through extreme cold air.\n"
