  title: In-season leaf damage by a biocontrol agent explains reproductive output
    of an invasive plant species
  abstract: 'Recent research has proven that plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) can shape
    plant community composition, and that soil inoculation can be used to steer this.
    This provides the yet unexplored potential to target PSF for the control of noxious
    weeds, which are among the major threats to native plant diversity and forage
    yield. Recent studies showed that PSF-induced changes in plant chemistry can consecutively
    affect aboveground herbivory, a driver of plant performance that is used in weed
    biocontrol. I have a solid background in biocontrol and plant population dynamics.
    In my project SOIL-4-CONTROL I aim to provide a proof-of-principle that integrates
    effects of PSF and aboveground herbivory to control common ragwort, a worldwide
    toxic weed of grasslands rapidly expanding in Europe. The project will also yield
    fundamental knowledge on the (chemical) interplay between PSF and herbivores.Hosted
    by Leiden University, I will join an ongoing experiment of my supervisor Prof.
    Bezemer, who manipulated PSF at large scale in the field by soil inoculation.
    By combining analysis of unpublished data, experimentation in this field, a mesocosm
    experiment, and chemical analysis of the plants used, I will 1) examine soil-mediated
    effects on ragwort establishment in the field; 2) quantify the role of soil-mediated
    and herbivore community effects on ragwort performance in the field; 3) disentangle
    effects of PSF, specialist and generalist herbivores, and plant competition on
    ragwort performance. I will involve nature managers for future use of our expected
    results in grassland restoration. With my secondment host CABI, an environmental
    management organisation, I will explore wider applications of PSF in invasive
    plant management, as urged by the EU Regulation 1143/2014. I will engage the public
    following my strong record in science communication. The excellent scientific
    environment and the training programme allow me to develop the professional maturity
    for a future PI position in Europe.
