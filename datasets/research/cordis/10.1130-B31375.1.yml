  title: 'Eolian cannibalism: Reworked loess and fluvial sediment as the main sources
    of the Chinese Loess Plateau'
  abstract: 'The Asian Monsoon is primarily driven by continent-ocean thermal contrasts,
    and frequent hydro-meteorological extreme events emphasize that it is affected
    by recent global climate change in response to increasing atmospheric level of
    carbon dioxide (pCO2). The medium and longer-timescale effects of circulation
    changes in the monsoon system control precipitation in continental Asia and, in
    the past, shaped Eurasian paleoenvironments and biotic evolution. The Asian monsoons
    have long been thought to have originated ~23 Million years ago, driven by regional
    uplift. However, recent studies have shown that the monsoons are millions of years
    more ancient than previously thought and were regionally similar to today during
    the high pCO2 Eocene Greenhouse episode. These studies open a vast array of new
    questions; (1) How did these early monsoons evolve through the Eocene? (2) How
    did they react to the numerous, short-term hyperthermal and hypothermal pCO2 events
    that ruled this period? This research project proposes to address these issues
    by focusing on three key sedimentary records in the Eocene monsoonal realm; in
    China, Myanmar, and Turkey. After refining the local stratigraphy through U/Pb
    geochronology of volcanic deposits, the three records will be investigated with
    respect to different geochemical and mineralogical paleoclimatic proxies. Elemental
    geochemistry and clay mineralogy will help to understand the evolution of seasonality
    and precipitation; stable and clumped isotope analyses on pedogenic carbonates
    and soil organic matter will document past rainfall amount, temperature and pCO2
    variations; U/Pb dating on aeolian dust deposits will allow the reconstruction
    of past wind patterns. The resulting findings will document the short- and long-term
    variations of the monsoons during the Eocene, and in light of modern global climate
    change, will furnish the basis for a substantial advance in our understanding
    of monsoonal forcing factors in a warmer, high-pCO2 world.
