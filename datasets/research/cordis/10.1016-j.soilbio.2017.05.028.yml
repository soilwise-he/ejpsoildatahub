  title: N fertilization in a Mediterranean ecosystem alters N and P turnover in soil,
    roots and the ectomycorrhizal community
  abstract: "SOILdarity is a three-year project aiming to enhance scientific excellence\
    \ in soil science. The project fosters the cooperation between two internationally\
    \ leading research-intensive institutions and FCi\xEAncias.ID - Associa\xE7\xE3\
    o para a Investiga\xE7\xE3o e Desenvolvimento de Ci\xEAncias (FC.ID). FC.ID is\
    \ a private non-profit association endowed with legal personality whose aim is\
    \ to support and develop research and innovation activities of the Faculty of\
    \ Sciences of the University of Lisbon (CI\xCANCIAS). CI\xCANCIAS is a key research\
    \ centre in soil science in Portugal. Within the framework of the Twinning exercise\
    \ the beneficiary is FC.ID while CI\xCANCIAS will be a linked third party to FC.ID.Soil\
    \ ecosystems in Portugal face considerable challenges in the medium and long run\
    \ ranging from climate change and erosion to over exploitation dynamics. By developing\
    \ SOILdarity, FC.ID and CI\xCANCIAS aims at boosting its research and innovation\
    \ capacity and improving its know-how in precision agriculture and sustainable\
    \ soil management through the knowledge-transfer dynamics established with the\
    \ internationally leading research-intensive partners, i.e. MIGAL and the University\
    \ of Ghent. The project lays down a sound scientific strategy on how to integrate\
    \ soil ecology with cutting-edge soil and crop sensors, modelling and system control\
    \ technology for sustainable soil management. The project methodology intervenes\
    \ on four complementary levels; a) transfer of knowledge to FC.ID/CI\xCANCIAS\
    \ on key research challenges; b) reinforcing FC.ID and CI\xCANCIAS\u2019 positioning\
    \ in the EU research arena, seeking new alliances with top R&I organisations;\
    \ c) skill and capacity building for a new generation of young researchers, who\
    \ will constitute the main capital of the Portuguese University in the years to\
    \ come; and d) develop a stable framework dedicated to international cooperation\
    \ and knowledge transfer.\n"
