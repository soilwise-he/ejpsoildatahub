  title: Mycorrhizal association of common European tree species shapes biomass and
    metabolic activity of bacterial and fungal communities in soil
  abstract: 'One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is to mitigate global
    climate changes caused by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Since soils
    constitute a larger carbon (C) pool than the vegetation and atmosphere together
    an important strategy could be to sequester more C in soils. Plant-soil interactions
    play an important role for ecosystem services such as C sequestration and N retention
    in soil and such interactions receive increasing attention among scientists and
    policymakers. Novel techniques such as next generation sequencing methods in combination
    with analysis of C stock patterns under different tree species present an opportunity
    to highlight complex processes and mechanisms which underlie C and N fluxes in
    soil. The proposed research is designed to (1) explore litter-mediated effects
    of common European tree species on C and N turnover in soil, (2) characterize
    effects of tree species on community structure and composition of soil biota,
    (3) evaluate the impact of common European tree species on metabolic diversity
    and structure and composition of functional genes related to C and N turnover;
    and finally, (4) to synthesize the role of soil biota for C and N turnover in
    soils. The research will be carried out within a unique common garden experiment
    with monoculture stands of six common European tree species; the broadleaves beech
    (Fagus sylvatica L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), lime (Tilia cordata
    L.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and
    the conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The proposed Marie-Curie
    fellowship is promising to highlight impacts of common European trees on complex
    interactions among soil microbiota and soil fauna and highlights their role for
    C and N stocks and fluxes. Results obtained from this research will contribute
    to bridge gaps in ecological theory in term of ecosystem functions and services.
