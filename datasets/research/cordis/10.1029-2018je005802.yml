  title: "Geological Evidence of Planet\u2010Wide Groundwater System on Mars"
  abstract: "Mars displays clear evidence of water, having regions where water flowed\
    \ at several times in its 4 billion years history. The aim of this fellowship\
    \ is to reconstruct paleo-hydrological conditions on late Mars (from 3Ga to date)\
    \ and to recreate the hydrogeological cycle that created the complex channel systems\
    \ found on Mars\u2019 surface. The stream tables, the Earth Simulation Lab and\
    \ numerical modelling at the UU will allow for the first time; 1) to simulate\
    \ frozen Martian subsoil characteristic and conditions; 2) to seek out signature\
    \ of melting ice as sources up front of Martian river systems; 3) to investigate\
    \ together the role of thermal and mechanical erosion. I will determine the lithological\
    \ and fluid characteristics and their possible related deposits, water source\
    \ triggering mechanisms, and will explain if it is by impact or spin axis / obliquity\
    \ changes. High-resolution digital elevation modelling will be used to constrain\
    \ hydrogeological parameters (under the telescope). Laboratory experiments and\
    \ numerical modelling using a streamtable and an Earth Simulation Laboratory will\
    \ support the core task (under the microscope). This research is urgently needed\
    \ as it addresses key questions about past Martian habitability and its implications\
    \ in subsurface degassing, potential landing site of future robotic/human missions\
    \ and climate. The inter-disciplinary perspective adopted in this study, close\
    \ integration of surface geology, analog modelling, and numerical modelling studies,\
    \ will provide important new knowledge on the late Mars environment. The Experienced\
    \ Researcher (ER) will work in the world-leading \u201CRiver and delta morphodynamics\
    \ group\u201D group in the Department of Physical Geography at Utrecht University.\
    \ The ER is already proving himself as a future leader; he has published five\
    \ peer-reviewed papers, and led international teams on fluvio-lacustrine features\
    \ and climate conditions and erosion rates on early Mars.\n"
