  title: 'Replacing Mineral Fertilisers for Bio-Based Fertilisers in Potato Growing
    on Sandy Soil: A Case Study'
  abstract: 'NUTRI2CYCLE will use an integrated approach to enable the transition
    from the current (suboptimal) nutrient household in European agriculture to the
    next-generation of agronomic practices, characterized by an improved upcycling
    of nutrients and organic carbon. The project is deeply rooted in pevious national
    and European projects, in which the consortium members were actively involved.
    The underlying principle is that Nutrient Use Efficency can be significantly improved
    by integrating on-farm techniques and systems that allow better reconnection between
    1) animal husbandry provided flows and 2) plant production requirements. At the
    same time this reconnection itself will serve a better C-return to soil and GHG-reduction
    by avoided emissions optionally combined with energy production for self-consumption
    on-farm.NUTRI2CYCLE aims to (i) benchmark mass flows of nutrients, organic carbon
    and GHG-footprint, (ii) provide an assessment frame (toolbox) for evaluating potential
    impact of proposed innovations, (iii) actively support concepts, techniques and
    scenarios put forward in EIP-Operational Groups, (iv) optimize these (+ in-consortium
    developed) scenarios using the toolbox, (v) showcase the most promising developments
    via prototypes and demos. Finally, using the experience gained at a local/regional
    scale, NUTRI2CYCLE will elaborate strategic scenarios to identify the effect of
    these innovations at European scale. NUTRI2CYCLE brings together the extensive
    expertise of leading experts in the field of nutrient cycling. This collaboration
    originates from the EIP-Focus Group on Nutrient Recycling, closely interacting
    with the EIP Operational Groups in the individual EU member states. Better nutrient
    stewardship engaging all actors across the value chain as envisaged in NUTRI2CYCLE
    will increase the C, N and P recycling rate significantly and will improve the
    overall sustainability and innovation capacity of European agricultural systems.
