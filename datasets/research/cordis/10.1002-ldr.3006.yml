  title: "Impacts of climate change adaptation options on soil functions: A review\
    \ of European case\u2010studies"
  abstract: 'Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient, indispensible for the survival of all
    living organisms on earth, including Man. However, due to human pressure, the
    N cycle has become the most altered among the element cycles, highlighting the
    N problem as one of the most pressing environmental issues faced today. Despite
    the recent work on nitrogen in Europe and the rest of the world, Portugal has
    not so far utilized its full capacity to integrate the available scientific, technical
    or practical knowledge. NitroPortugal addresses how to improve the S&T skills
    and the scientific output of Portugal, at the same time strengthening the potential
    for N policy application. The project develops around the consensus that N is
    an emerging issue, that it impacts all the environmental compartments, and has
    both human health and social implications. This twinning effort on N is divided
    into five key areas which coincide with the whole N concept WAGES (Water, Air,
    Greenhouse gases, Ecosystems and biodiversity and Soil) launched by the European
    Nitrogen Assessment. Based on bringing together existing data on data analysis
    and on training in new methods for each of the five key topics, a comprehensive
    analysis will be delivered that prioritizes the key gaps in knowledge. These gaps
    will then serve as themes for different types of training activities. Emerging
    questions will feed brainstorming workshops to be held at key points through the
    project, which will strengthen the Portuguese skills base and enhance peer-review
    publication. Based on the new skills of the host country team, the basis for preparing
    a Portuguese Nitrogen Assessment will be obtained that will strengthen Portuguese
    engagement within the EU and in UNECE Air and Water Conventions. The resulting
    increase in scientific productivity, associated with strengthened networking between
    the Portuguese and international partners will be measurable through objective
    indicators of publication output, policy support and the public engagement
