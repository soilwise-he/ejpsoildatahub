  title: 'Vanishing permanent glaciers: climate change is threatening a European Union
    habitat (Code 8340) and its poorly known biodiversity'
  abstract: 'Glaciers show a pattern of retreat at the global scale. Increasing areas
    are exposed and colonized by multiple organisms, but lack of global studies hampers
    a complete understanding of the future of recently deglaciated terrains. What
    will be the fate of these areas? How do animals, plants and microorganisms colonize
    them? How do they interact to perform successful colonization? Which are the climatic,
    geological and biogeographical processes determining colonization patterns? How
    does ecosystem functioning evolves through time? Until now, the complete reconstruction
    of soil communities was hampered by the complexity of identification of organisms,
    thus analyses at broad geographical and taxonomic scale have been so far impossible.
    IceCommunities will combine innovative methods and a global approach to boost
    our understanding of the evolution of ecosystems in recently deglaciated areas.
    I will investigate chronosequences ranging from recently deglaciated terrains
    to late successional stages of soil pedogenesis. Through environmental DNA metabarcoding
    I will identify species from multiple taxonomic groups (bacteria, fungi, protists,
    soil invertebrates, plants), to obtain a complete reconstruction of biotic communities
    along glacier forelands over multiple mountain areas across the globe. This will
    allow measuring the rate of colonization at an unprecedented detail. Information
    on assemblages will be combined with analyses of soil, landscape and climate to
    identify the drivers of community changes. I will also identify the impact of
    eco-geographical factors (climate, regional pool of potential colonizers) on colonization.
    Analysis of functional traits will allow reconstructing how functional diversity
    emerges during community formation, and how it scales to the functioning of food
    webs. IceCommunities will help to predict the future development of these increasingly
    important ecosystems, providing a supported rationale for the appropriate management
    of these areas
