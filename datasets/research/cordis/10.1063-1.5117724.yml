  title: Industrial-scale prototype of cTES for water consumption reduction and power
    block efficiency improvement - SOLWATT PROJECT
  abstract: "SOLWARIS targets to significantly reduce the water used by CSP plants\
    \ (by 35% for wet cooled & by 90% for dry cooled). The project proposes to demonstrate\
    \ the efficiency of innovations on solar field cleaning, power-block cooling,\
    \ water recycling system, and plant operation strategy. Among these are solutions\
    \ to reduce solar field water cleaning needs, an operation and maintenance optimizer\
    \ software including soiling forecaster, a MEE water recovery technology running\
    \ on otherwise dumped heat from the solar field, and a cooling concept for the\
    \ turbine condenser storing excess heat when ambient is too warm, then releasing\
    \ it during cool night times.The solutions will be implemented at two CSP operational\
    \ sites, \u201CLa Africana\u201D parabolic trough plant in Spain and \u201CAshalim\u201D\
    \ central receiver plant in Israel, to demonstrate significant reduction in water\
    \ use while making CSP more cost effective, and achieving near-to-market status.\
    \ The solutions are best applied together, but each will also bring water and\
    \ cost savings on its own, thanks to their ability to fit any kind of CSP plant;\
    \ dry, wet, or hybrid cooled, existing or future ones, tailored to location and\
    \ policy framework. Their application will save more than 0.5 M\u20AC/year of\
    \ operational cost for a 50 MW CSP plant. Regarding competition on water resources\
    \ and humanitarian issues, the social acceptance of CSP will be increased by detailed\
    \ analysis of case studies and education of local population to the benefits of\
    \ solar energy. The targeted savings of water and operation costs will increase\
    \ CSP\u2019s competitiveness compared to other renewable energy and the electricity\
    \ market in general, as well as its acceptance within local communities, achieving\
    \ a big step forward in the SET plan goals for CSP technology by 2020. The consortium,\
    \ led by TSK Electr\xF3nica y Electricidad S.A. (Spain), is made up of 13 partners\
    \ from 6 European countries plus Israel, including 5 industrials partners, 2 SMEs,\
    \ 5 RTOs and one University.\n"
