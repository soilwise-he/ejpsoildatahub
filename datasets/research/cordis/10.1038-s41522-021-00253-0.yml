  title: Emergent bacterial community properties induce enhanced drought tolerance
    in Arabidopsis
  abstract: "As the world population is continuously increasing, the supply of food\
    \ with equal accessibility has become a major issue and future challenge. Microbes\
    \ are unexploited tool to increase food productivity and quality. The objective\
    \ of SIMBA project is to harness complex soil and marine microbial communities\
    \ (microbiomes) for the sustainable production of food. SIMBA will focus on two\
    \ interconnected food chains, i.e. crop production, aquaculture.  SIMBA will first\
    \ launch  an in silico phase in order to  analyze the  further pre-existing microbiome\
    \ databases and earlier studies,  to identify  the best microbiome layout capable\
    \ of supporting food chain quality and productivity. Microbiome-tailored interventions\
    \ will be specifically developed including soil, plant, fish, aquaculture and\
    \ food/feed processing towards optimal layout as defined in the modelling step,\
    \ as follows;  i) Identified optimal microbiome consortia will be designed and\
    \ tested in lab, pot and field trials to improve plant productivity and health;\
    \  ii)  Marine microbiomes will be applied to facilitate sustainable aqua and\
    \ agriculture;  iii) Optimal microbe/microbe consortia will be used to convert\
    \ raw-materials and residuals to high quality food, feed or finally to energy.\
    \ In a final intervention step, these interactions will be monitored and tested\
    \ in field, aqua-culturing, fish feeding and human studies, measuring the impact\
    \ on microbiome consortia, interactions in association with factors evaluating\
    \ their efficacy in terms of improving food security, productivity, quality, safety,\
    \ sustainability,  nutritional and health aspects. Near to market\u201D microbiome\
    \ applications for sustainable food systems will be provided thanks to the interdisciplinary\
    \ and cross-sectional nature of the proposal and the active role of small and\
    \ medium sized enterprises (SMEs).\n"
