  title: The Effect of Moisture on Cellulose Nanocrystals Intended as a High Gas Barrier
    Coating on Flexible Packaging Materials
  abstract: 'BIOCOMPLACK is a biobased, biodegradable and compostable food packaging
    with enhances barrier properties. BIOCOMPLACK is a food biopackaging with three
    main points of innovation; the use of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), the multilayer
    structure and the PLA biopolymer reinforced with organoclays which contain natural
    food preservatives. These three innovations will enhance the barrier properties
    to oxygen (more than 100 times compared with common biopackaging) and water vapour
    as well as will improve the shelf-life of food. BIOCOMPLACK is an alternative
    to common bio-packaging products that enhances 300% the shelf-life of food.This
    international project is born in a consortium integrated by two large enterprises
    (Sapici and Goglio), two small-medium enterprises (SMEs) (NaturePlast and Tecnopackaging)
    and a research institution (Packlab, University of Milan) from four different
    countries which together cover the supply chain of the food packaging industry.BIOCOMPLACK
    will have strong impact in the society and in the environment. BIOCOMPLACK will
    be an eco-friendly packaging from natural renewable sources instead of fossil
    fuels, will reduce the plastic packaging waste thanks to its biodegradability
    in the nature and will generate at the end of its useful life an added value product,
    the compost (to improve the quality of soils and provide nutrients). Our BIOCOMPLACK
    solution will provide a loop cycle of sustainability.European Union will be also
    impacted by BIOCOMPLACK because it will make a substantial contribution to innovation
    in the European economy, will reduce the import of biopackaging from outside the
    EU and we will export at international level.This consortium will also be benefited
    by bringing into the market the BIOCOMPLACK food packaging in 36 months. The profitability
    of the project presents for the first 5 years a ROI of 2.47 and the pay-back of
    the project will be achieved after 2 years and 9 months after the beginning of
    the commercialization
