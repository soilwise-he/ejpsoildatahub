  title: Spoof-Fluid-Spoof Acoustic Waveguide and its Applications for Sound Manipulation
  abstract: 'New sensing devices and technologies are the key in addressing numerous
    challenges that agriculture is facing today. Namely, to provide more food for
    the ever-growing population, a number of biophysical parameters of plants, soil
    and food products need to be monitored and measured constantly, thus providing
    valuable data needed to optimize the entire agricultural process. In addition,
    the corresponding actuating technologies responsible for applying various measures
    (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) need to become more precise and allow variable
    rate inputs with a resolution down to an individual plant.To provide novel sensing
    and actuating solutions able to address the burning issues in agriculture today,
    NOCTURNO will bring together and synergistically advance several highly promising
    research directions which have been investigated separately in the last decade;
    wave-matter interactions, plasmonics, complex media and artificial materials,
    acoustic, electromagnetics, optics, bionanosensing.The Project will focus on development
    of sensors and actuators based on non-conventional propagation of acoustic waves
    in artificial media, electromagnetic/optical sensors based on metasurfaces, and
    advanced manufacturing technologies including 3D printing, laser-micromachining
    technology, and e-beam lithography with the aim to provide practical solutions
    for the fabrication of novel acoustic and metasurface-based sensors and actuators.NOCTURNO
    proposes an exchange programme which brings together three European academic institutions,
    two European SME companies, and two third-country universities. The consortium
    has the specific expertise in the fields listed above and it will create synergies
    that will first advance the current level of fundamental scientific knowledge
    and then support its transformation into innovative products with the high potential
    to revolutionize the agri-food sector.
