  title: Rice production threatened by coupled stresses of climate and soil arsenic
  abstract: "Rice is the staple food worldwide. Unfortunately, global rice yield is\
    \ already falling behind population growth. One of the reasons for this is the\
    \ presence of toxic arsenic (As) in many South(-East) Asian paddy soils, which\
    \ is known to decrease rice growth and productivity. The current change in Earth\u2019\
    s climate is known to cause land loss due to desertification and inundation and\
    \ lower (rice) crop yields, thus, threatening the global food security. According\
    \ to the highest emission scenario for greenhouse gases presented in the 5th assessment\
    \ report of the IPCC, global annual temperatures could rise by more than 5\xB0\
    C by the year 2100. How increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations affect As\
    \ uptake into rice and ultimately the quality and production of rice is unknown\
    \ and the main research question of this proposal. Rice will be grown in fully\
    \ controlled growth chambers with elevated temperature and partial pressure of\
    \ CO2, simulating the cli-mate of the year 2100. Besides determining changes in\
    \ rice growth and grain yield, the amount of organic and inorganic As in the grain\
    \ will be determined to assess rice quality. Furthermore, the biogeochemical pro-cesses\
    \ occurring in the soil and atmosphere during climate change will be investigated\
    \ and thus, will allow to understand the observed changes in rice yield and quality\
    \ due to climate change. The amount and speciation of As will be quantified in\
    \ the soil, plant, and atmosphere. Changes in microbial community abundance and\
    \ richness will be assessed with modern pyrosequencing techniques. Functional\
    \ microbial guilds of interest (iron and arsenic metabolizing bacteria) will be\
    \ assessed by qPCR, pyrosequencing, and clone libraries. Overall, the knowledge\
    \ obtained within the MSC-GF action on the impact of climate change on As uptake\
    \ by rice will allow a better risk assessment for productivity of rice in the\
    \ future and may give ideas for how to prevent a loss in rice yield and quality\
    \ in a strongly climate impacted future.\n"
