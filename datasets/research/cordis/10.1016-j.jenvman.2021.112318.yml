  title: Dynamic soil functions assessment employing land use and climate scenarios
    at regional scale
  abstract: "Targeting ambitious changes in agricultural practices that would preserve\
    \ restore and enhance soil carbon and soil health requires an increased coordination\
    \ of international research cooperation. The specific challenge lies in the identification,\
    \ implementation and verification of agricultural soil management practices  which\
    \ create a positive soil/ecosystem carbon budget at the farm and landscape levels,\
    \ sequester carbon, improve soil structure and soil quality and provide climate\
    \ change adaptation while contributing to sustainable development. In this context,\
    \ the CSA CIRCASA has an overarching goal to develop synergies on research in\
    \ this field at European Union and global level, targeting four realistic and\
    \ highly complementary objectives;O1. Strengthen the international research community\
    \ on agricultural soil carbon sequestration;O2. Provide an improved understanding\
    \ of agricultural soil carbon sequestration and its potential for climate change\
    \ mitigation and adaptation and for demands of increased food production;O3. Synthesizing\
    \ stakeholder\u2019s views and knowledge needs on agricultural soil carbon sequestration\
    \ and climate changeO4. Favor a more structured approach, by preparing an International\
    \ Research Consortium (IRC)These four objectives will produce measurable outputs\
    \ during the time frame of the project and create significant outcomes for the\
    \ implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and of the Paris\
    \ agreement (COP21, 4 per 1000 voluntary initiative) of the UN Framework Convention\
    \ on Climate Change (UNFCCC). CIRCASA will benefit from the participation of three\
    \ major initiatives; the Global Research Alliance on agricultural greenhouse gases\
    \ (GRA), the Joint Programming Initiative on Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security\
    \ and Climate Change (FACCE JPI) and the 4 per 1000 - Soils for Food Security\
    \ and Climate  - initiative, and from the contribution of the CCCAFS and the WLE\
    \ programs of the CGIAR.\n"
