  title: Examining the opportunities for nature-based solutions at the Municipality
    of Piraeus
  abstract: 'For proGIreg three front-runner cities (Dortmund (DE); Turin (IT); Zagreb
    (HR))will create Living Labs in urban areas which face the challenge of post-industrial
    regeneration. These areas suffer from social and economic disadvantages, inequality
    and related crime and security problems. They lack quality greenspaces, have a
    negative impact on human health and wellbeing and are more vulnerable to the effects
    of climate change. Going beyond the current state-of-the-art with Green Infrastructure
    as a one-off state intervention, the proGIreg Living Labs will develop NBS which
    are citizen owned and co-developed by state, market and civil society stakeholders.
    Innovation will take place on the technical level through the NBS deployments,
    on the social level through co-designing, co-creating and co-implementing NBS
    with local communities and on the economic level through combining NBS with market-ready
    business models. Four follower cities in Eastern and Southern Europe (Cascais
    PT, Cluj-Napoca RO, Piraeus GR, Zenica BA) will be co-steering the research process
    to assure replicability and adaptability to their local context resulting in urban
    plans for NBS deployment. The NBS to be tested i.a. include; regenerating industrial
    soils biotic compounds, creating community-based urban agriculture and aquaponics
    and making renatured river corridors accessible for local residents.Scientific
    assessment and monitoring results from the Living Labs will be made available
    on the EU NBS platforms OPPLA and THINKNATURE and will contribute to the European
    reference framework for NBS. Global impact will be achieved by a training programme
    for cooperative planning, implementation and management of NBS. It will be provided
    by partners from the cities, SMEs and universities involved. Training events will
    be organised in cooperation with the partner ICLEI. Massive Open Online Courses
    (MOOCs) will be distributed via EdX, the most renowned MOOCs platform worldwide.
