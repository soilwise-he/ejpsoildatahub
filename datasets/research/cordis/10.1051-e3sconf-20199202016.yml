  title: The effect of clay water content in the Jet Erosion Test
  abstract: "TERRE aims to develop novel geo-technologies to address the competitiveness\
    \ challenge of the European construction industry in a low carbon agenda. It will\
    \ be delivered through an inter-sectoral and intra-European coordinated PhD programme\
    \ focused on carbon-efficient design of geotechnical infrastructure. Industry\
    \ and Research in the construction sector have been investing significantly in\
    \ recent years to produce innovative low-carbon technologies. However, little\
    \ innovation has been created in the geo-infrastructure industry, which is lagging\
    \ behind other construction industry sectors. TERRE aims to close this gap through\
    \ a network-wide training programme carried out by a close collaboration of eleven\
    \ Universities and Research Centres and three SMEs. It is structured to provide\
    \ a balanced combination of fundamental and applied research and will eventually\
    \ develop operational tools such as software for low-carbon geotechnical design\
    \ and a Decision Support System for infrastructure project appraisal. The research\
    \ fellows will be involved in inter-sectoral and intra-European projects via enrolment\
    \ in 8 \u2018Joint-Awards\u2019 and 7 \u2018Industrial\u2019 PhDs. The research\
    \ fellows will be trained in low-carbon design by developing novel design concepts\
    \ including eco-reinforced geomaterials, \u2018engineered\u2019 vegetation, engineered\
    \ soil-atmosphere interfaces, biofilms, shallow geothermal energy and soil carbon\
    \ sequestration. Distinctive features of TERRE are the supervision by an inter-sectoral\
    \ team and the orientation of the research towards technological applications.\
    \ Training at the Network level includes the development of entrepreneurial skills\
    \ via a special programme on \u2018Pathways to Research Enterprise\u2019 to support\
    \ the research fellows in establishing and leading spin-out companies after the\
    \ end of the project.\n"
