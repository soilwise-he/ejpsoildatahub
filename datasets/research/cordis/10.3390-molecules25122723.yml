  abstract: "NoAW ; No Agro-Waste.Innovative approaches to turn agricultural waste\
    \ into ecological and economic assets.Driven by a \u201Cnear zero-waste\u201D\
    \ society requirement, the goal of NoAW project is to generate innovative efficient\
    \ approaches to convert growing agricultural waste issues into eco-efficient bio-based\
    \ products opportunities with direct benefits for both environment, economy and\
    \ EU consumer. To achieve this goal, the NoAW concept relies on developing holistic\
    \ life cycle thinking able to support environmentally responsible R&D innovations\
    \ on agro-waste conversion at different TRLs, in the light of regional and seasonal\
    \ specificities, not forgetting risks emerging from circular management of agro-wastes\
    \ (e.g. contaminants accumulation).By involving all agriculture chain stakeholders\
    \ in a territorial perspective, the project will;(1) develop innovative eco-design\
    \ and hybrid assessment tools of circular agro-waste management strategies and\
    \ address related gap of knowledge and data via extensive exchange through the\
    \ Knowledge exchange Stakeholders Platform, (2) develop breakthrough knowledge\
    \ on agro-waste molecular complexity and heterogeneity in order to upgrade the\
    \ most widespread mature conversion technology (anaerobic digestion) and to synergistically\
    \ eco-design robust cascading processes to fully convert agro-waste into a set\
    \ of high added value bio-energy, bio-fertilizers and bio-chemicals and building\
    \ blocks, able to substitute a significant range of non-renewable equivalents,\
    \ with favourable air, water and soil impacts and (3) get insights of the complexity\
    \ of potentially new, cross-sectors, business clusters in order to fast track\
    \ NoAW strategies toward the field and develop new business concepts and stakeholders\
    \ platform for cross-chain valorisation of agro-waste on a territorial and seasonal\
    \ basis.\n"
