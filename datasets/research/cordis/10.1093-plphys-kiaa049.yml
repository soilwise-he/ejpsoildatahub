  title: Distinct signaling routes mediate intercellular and intracellular rhizobial
    infection inLotus japonicus
  abstract: "Plant roots and soil microbes have been associated since the emergence\
    \ of plants on land. Nevertheless the mechanisms that have coevolved to control\
    \ these commensal and mutualistic associations are currently unknown. RINFEC will\
    \ identify both plant and bacterial genes involved in root colonization by commensal\
    \ and mutualistic bacteria with an approach that would be transformative in the\
    \ field. The ambitious challenge is to identify and functionally characterize\
    \ the central genes controlling root cells competence for infection. RINFEC\xB4\
    s central hypothesis is that key components of ancient pathways for bacterial\
    \ colonization of the root surface (rhizosphere) and root interior (endosphere)\
    \ were adapted during evolution of mechanism(s) controlling colonization of legume\
    \ roots by symbiotic rhizobia. RINFEC will uncover the genetics and biochemistry\
    \ of these shared mechanisms by characterizing a novel, unexplored intercellular\
    \ infection mode observed for certain rhizobia that act as endophytes in non-legume\
    \ plants and are able to infect the model legume Lotus japonicus. The unique biological\
    \ feature exploited in RINFEC is the capacity of Lotus to support either intercellular\
    \ entry (conserved mode) or legume specific infection thread entry, dependent\
    \ on the rhizobia encountered. This allows comparative investigations of these\
    \ two infection modes in simple binary interactions with the same host. Given\
    \ the exceptional ability of different rhizobia for intercellular endophytic colonization\
    \ of non-legume roots this provides an unprecedented platform to identify mechanisms\
    \ by which plants selectively enable a subset of bacteria to infect roots. RINFEC\
    \ will build on my considerable expertise with Lotus and pioneers novel plant\
    \ and bacterial genetic methods, cell-layer transcriptomics, phospho-proteomics\
    \ and advanced biochemistry to break new ground in understanding infection and\
    \ soil microbe influences on plant performance under environmental stress conditions.\n"
