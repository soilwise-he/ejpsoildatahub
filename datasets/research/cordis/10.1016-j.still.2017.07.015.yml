  title: Spatial variability of soil properties and cereal yield in a cultivated field
    on sandy soil
  abstract: 'Knowledge regarding the complex interplay between agricultural land use
    and management and soil quality and function is fragmented and incomplete, in
    particular with regard to underlying principles and regulating mechanisms. The
    main aim of iSQAPER is to develop an interactive soil quality assessment tool
    (SQAPP) for agricultural land users that integrates newly derived process understanding
    and accounts for the impact of agricultural land use and management on soil properties
    and functions, and related ecosystem services. For this purpose, >30 long-term
    experimental field trials in the EU and China will be analysed to derive regulating
    principles for integration in SQAPP. SQAPP will be developed using a multi-actor
    approach aiming at facilitating social innovation and providing options to land
    users for cost-effective agricultural management activities to enhance soil quality
    and crop productivity. SQAPP will be tested extensively in 14 dedicated Case Study
    Sites in the EU and China covering a wide spectrum of farming systems and pedo-climatic
    zones, and rolled-out across the continents thereafter. Within the Case Study
    sites a range of alternative agricultural practices will be selected, implemented
    and evaluated with regard to effects on improving soil quality and crop productivity.
    Proven practices will be evaluated for their potential applicability at EU and
    China levels, and to assess the related soil environmental footprint under current
    and future agricultural trends and various agricultural policy scenarios. How
    the soil quality tool can be utilized for different policy purposes, e.g. in cross
    compliance and agro-environmental measures, will also be investigated and demonstrated.
    A comprehensive dissemination and communication strategy, including a web-based
    information portal, will ensure that project results are available to a variety
    of stakeholders at the right time and in appropriate formats to enhance soil quality
    and productivity in the EU and China.
