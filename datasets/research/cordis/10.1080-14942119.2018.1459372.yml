  title: "Sustainability impacts of increased forest biomass feedstock supply \u2013\
    \ a comparative assessment of technological solutions"
  abstract: "The project focuses on increasing access to wood resources through more\
    \ efficient silviculture and a better understanding of the business models governing\
    \ the procurement of forest operations services. The project further considers\
    \ increasing efficiency in forest harvesting and collection, and the reduction\
    \ of soil impact from forest operations, and puts forward ways of making this\
    \ a measurable and integrated part of operational efficiency. TECH4EFFECT offers\
    \ the potential to revolutionize forest operations with a state-of-the-art knowledge-based\
    \ efficiency development system, providing easily accessible decision support\
    \ exploiting the large amount of data available in modern industrial forest management.\
    \ The ambition of TECH4EFFECT is to implement such as management tool, enhanced\
    \ through 4 years of intensive R&D in close cooperation with the end-users of\
    \ the Efficiency Portal in 5 participating countries. It is the project\u2019\
    s hope that implementation will result in such obvious benefits amongst the industrial\
    \ partners that its application will become widespread within the European forest\
    \ sector.\n"
