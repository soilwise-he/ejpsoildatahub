  title: Changes in Soil Ecosystem Structure and Functions Due to Soil Contamination
  abstract: 'Concept; Global climate change is displayed as a set of stressors (increasing
    temperature and CO2 levels, decreasing soil moisture content, higher UV radiation
    exposure) potentially impairing both biotic and abiotic ecosystem components.
    This may worsen in environments degraded by human activities where organisms have
    to deal with multiple stress factors, i.e. in multi-stressed environments, and
    the toxicity of the contaminants present may change depending on climate conditions.
    GLOBALTOX aims at assessing how the toxicity of anthropogenic multi-stressed soils
    may be affected under the current global warming perspective, using soil invertebrates
    as bioindicators along with soil physicochemical and microbiological parameters.Methodology;
    An inter/multidisciplinary ecotoxicological approach will be applied to soils
    from different environments with high human pressure (metal mining and agricultural
    areas), different soil invertebrate species (collembolans and enchytraeids) and
    single and multiple combinations of different climate factors (air temperature,
    soil moisture content, atmospheric CO2 concentrations and UV radiation). Climate
    factor combinations will be based on the emission scenarios predicted by the IPCC
    by the year 2100. For a complete overview of the problem, the project will rely
    on changes in key soil parameters (pH, organic matter, nutrient cycling, microbial
    community) and soil invertebrates (body metal concentrations, enzymatic biomarkers,
    DNA-damage, gene expression) to understand the effects at organism/population
    level (survival and reproduction).Impact; The foreground derived from the project
    will improve the environmental risk assessment of anthropogenic-degraded areas
    under future scenarios of climate change. GLOBALTOX will promote the social perception
    and awareness of anthropogenic contamination under a global warming perspective
    and the suitability of using soil invertebrates as bioindicators of toxicity changes.
