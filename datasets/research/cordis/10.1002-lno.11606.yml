  title: The relevance of environment vs. composition on dissolved organic matter
    degradation in freshwaters
  abstract: 'Organic carbon  is exported from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems
    where, not only is it being degraded and eventually lost as carbon dioxide, but
    such degradation occurs faster than in soils or marine systems. Across freshwaters,
    variations in organic matter degradation and reactivity have been related to compositional
    changes in  organic matter. The flux from terrestrial to aquatic systems seems
    to be increasing associated to anthropogenic perturbations. However, despite the
    relevance of these fluxes for the global C cycle, Earth System Models (ESMs) are
    just starting to consider them. In that sense, a particularly crucial region deserving
    urgent attention is the Arctic, as permafrost soils hold a massive C stock that
    is vulnerable to being mobilized towards freshwaters. Such transfer could turn
    that vulnerable C stock from a sink into a carbon dioxide source. Therefore, determining
    the reactivity of that organic matter flux and incorporating it in surface models
    is key at the moment. The foundation of CHROME is the idea that the chemical diversity
    of organic matter explains its reactivity and, as such, should be considered in
    biogeochemical models. CHROME represents the first attempt to incorporate organic
    matter chemical diversity to ESMs, and will do so by; i) developing and selecting
    functional chemical diversity indices as indicators of Arctic organic matter reactivity
    and ii) implementing that knowledge in a regional branch of an ESM. CHROME is
    based on the good match between the previous experience of the applicant and the
    excellence of the host institutions, leaders in the field of biogeochemical research
    in Arctic ecosystems (USGS, Boulder) and in global modelling (LSCE-CNRS, France).
    CHROME will constitute a key advance in C biogeochemical understanding and modelling,
    which will position the fellow at the forefront of geosciences research.
