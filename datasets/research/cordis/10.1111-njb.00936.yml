  title: Environmental factors and ground disturbance affecting the composition of
    species and functional traits of ground layer lichens on grey dunes and dune heaths
    of Estonia
  abstract: 'Contemporary nature conservation policy in Europe has identified the
    protection of alvars and other semi-natural grasslands to be important for halting
    biodiversity loss. Loss of biodiversity implies not only species and communities
    but also loss of genetic diversity. To design effective conservation strategies
    for threatened biodiversity, the basic biology of the target organisms needs to
    be understood. Lichens are symbiotic entities consisting of at least two components,
    a fungus (mycobiont) and algae and/or cyanobacteria (photobionts), living in intimate
    symbiotic association. The genetic diversity of cyanobacteria will be studied
    in cyanobacterial lichens (cyanolichens) and in free-living cyanobacteria that
    form biological soil crusts (BSC) in North European alvars. The main DNA markers
    used will be tRNALeu (UAA) intron and 16S sequences for cyanobacteria and ITS
    sequences for lichen mycobionts. Cyanobiont specificity of lichen mycobionts and
    possible overlap in the cyanobiont spectra of different lichens will be determined.
    Also free-living Nostoc genotypes from the same habitats will be screened in order
    to establish their potential role in the symbiont pool. The diversity of lichen
    cyanobionts and free-living cyanobacteria in alvars, restored alvars and alvar-like
    substitution habitats will be compared to determine the effects of disturbance
    history on genotype diversity patterns. This study targets the very poorly known
    relationships between lichen-symbiotic cyanobacteria and their free-living relatives
    and will be the first of its kind in any grassland environment. The results will
    significantly improve our understanding of lichen biology and community ecology,
    and especially of the role of symbiont specificity in generating and maintaining
    lichen diversity. The results will have wide practical application in the design
    of conservation measures to protect the highly specialized BSC communities of
    the remaining semi-natural grassland in North Europe.
