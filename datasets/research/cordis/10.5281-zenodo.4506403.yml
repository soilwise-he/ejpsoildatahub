  title: Quantifying biogenic carbon dioxide fluxes in an urban area
  abstract: 'Monitoring CO2 emissions of urban areas has become a necessity for sustainable
    urban planning and climate change mitigation. The current urban inventories are
    based on top-down approaches that use fuel and electricity consumption statistics
    for determining CO2 emissions. Such approaches present consistency issues, neglect
    the biogenic components of the urban carbon cycle (i.e. vegetation, soil) and
    have restricted spatial and temporal resolution. The main goal of diFUME is to
    provide a robust methodology for mapping and monitoring the actual urban CO2 flux
    at optimum spatial and temporal scales, meaningful for urban design decisions.
    diFUME will develop, apply and evaluate independent models, capable to estimate
    all the different components of the urban carbon cycle (i.e. building emissions,
    traffic emissions, human metabolism, photosynthetic uptake, plant respiration,
    soil respiration). An innovative interdisciplinary methodology will be introduced,
    combining two cutting-edge technology tools, the Eddy Covariance (EC) and the
    latest advances in Earth Observation (EO). EC provides continuous in-situ measurements
    of CO2 flux at the local scale. Previous EC applications in urban areas have provided
    valuable insights on the holistic understanding of the urban CO2 flux according
    to the source/sink distribution in the highly heterogeneous urban environment.
    EO offers synoptic and continuous monitoring of large areas, capable of enhanced
    representation of the urban cover, morphology and function. Combined use of EO
    and EC can provide enhanced interpretation and modelling capabilities to achieve
    fine scale mapping and monitoring of urban CO2 flux. diFUME methodology will be
    developed and applied in the case study of Basel, exploiting the unique infrastructure
    and long-term urban EC measurements. diFUME methodology can be transferable to
    any city, providing an independent toolbox for consistent urban CO2 emission monitoring,
    supporting sustainable urban planning strategies.
