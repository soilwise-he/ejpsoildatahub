  title: Detection of physical hazards in soil profiles using quantitative soil physical
    quality assessment in the Pannonian basin, Eastern Austria
  abstract: "SHui is conceived as a network integrating long-term experiments of its\
    \ 19 academic and SME partners across different environmental conditions and cropping\
    \ systems in the EU and China. It provides a platform for research on soil-water\
    \ resources management under water scarce conditions, to better understand the\
    \ linkages between agricultural soil hydrology and sustainability and for a systematic\
    \ assessment of adaptation and mitigation methods. It will develop and implement\
    \ new strategies to increase water use efficiency and yield, based on sustainable\
    \ intensification through integrated use of soil and water across different spatial\
    \ scales. At farm level, this includes digital agriculture solutions integrating\
    \ in situ and remote sensors and simulation models to exploit an improved understanding\
    \ of the relationship between crop yield variability and soil hydraulic properties,\
    \ optimizing circular approaches to re-use water and using waste water sources.\
    \ These technical approaches are reliant on optimum data utilization and transdisciplinary\
    \ research with multiple stakeholders. At regional scales, the aggregation of\
    \ biophysical and socioeconomic variables in dynamic models will evaluate the\
    \ impact of different policy strategies, to support decision makers to evaluate\
    \ different scenarios of land-use dynamics, economic context and current and future\
    \ climate in EU and China, including assessments of water and carbon footprint.\
    \ SHui will exploit scientific, technological and social innovations by disseminating\
    \ and communicating these to multiple stakeholders, and implementing novel technological\
    \ packages from farm to large regional scales. It aims to make a significant contribution\
    \ to the EU and China Research Agenda for Agriculture in providing food security\
    \ and optimum use of scarce soil and water resources. Training a cohort of early\
    \ career scientists in soil conservation and water-saving practices, SHui\u2019\
    s legacy will extend beyond the project duration.\n"
