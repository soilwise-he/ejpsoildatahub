  title: Evaluating the suitability of the consumer low-cost Parrot Flower Power soil
    moisture sensor for scientific environmental applications
  abstract: "The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform\
    \ and community to generate, share and utilise information on land, soil and water\
    \ resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to\
    \ underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting\
    \ the demands of food production, and to answer a long-standing challenge for\
    \ space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites.\
    \ GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer\
    \ sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and\
    \ plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed\
    \ to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe,\
    \ and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the\
    \ collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing\
    \ data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering\
    \ advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific\
    \ and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop \u2018campaigns\u2019\
    \ (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin\
    \ smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives. GROW will actively\
    \ identify and enable new and credible social and business innovation processes,\
    \ creating potential new services, applications and markets. The outcome will\
    \ be a central hub of open knowledge and data created and maintained by growers\
    \ that will be of value to the citizens themselves as well as specialist communities\
    \ in science, policy and industry. The GROW partnership will connect and scale\
    \ to globally dispersed communities linked through digital and social platforms,\
    \ and a wide range of additional citizen associations and NGOs in sustainable\
    \ agriculture, gardening, food democracy and land management.\n"
