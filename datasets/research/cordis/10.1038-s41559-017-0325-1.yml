  title: Diversity-dependent temporal divergence of ecosystem functioning in experimental
    ecosystems
  abstract: "Earth is experiencing substantial biodiversity losses at the global scale,\
    \ while both species gains and losses are occurring locally and regionally. Nonrandom\
    \ changes in species distributions could profoundly influence ecosystem functions\
    \ and services. However, few experimental tests have examined the influences of\
    \ invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionally strong impacts\
    \ on native ecosystems. Invasive earthworms are a prime example of ecosystem engineers\
    \ that influence many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworms\
    \ invading northern North American forests may cause simultaneous species gains\
    \ and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like\
    \ nutrient cycling and crucial services like carbon sequestration. Using a synthetic\
    \ combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses,\
    \ the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects\
    \ on relationships between plant communities, soil food webs, and ecosystem processes.\
    \ Further, effects of a changing climate on the spread and consequences of earthworm\
    \ invasion will be investigated. Meta-analyses will be used to test if earthworms\
    \ cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem\
    \ state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude\
    \ of effects differ from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity\
    \ between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global\
    \ scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on\
    \ biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground\u2013\
    belowground perspective. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes exotic\
    \ earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based\
    \ community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering\
    \ a new generation of biodiversity\u2013ecosystem function research.\n"
