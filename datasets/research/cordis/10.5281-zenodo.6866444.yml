  title: ThermoMechanoChemical (TMC) fractionation of aquaculture by products by twin
    screw extrusion for the production of biobased fertilisers
  abstract: 'SEA2LAND aims to provide solutions to help overcome challenges related
    to food production, climate change and waste reuse. The SEA2LAND project will
    meet this challenge by improving and adapting technologies for nutrient recovery
    to produce biobased fertilizers (BBFs) from fish processing and aquaculture byproducts.
    It will promote the production of large-scale fertilizers in the EU from own raw
    materials, based on the circular economy model, transforming by-products into
    nutrients for crops. SEA2LAND will contribute to the independence and security
    in the supply of nutrients to European agriculture, reducing the nutrient imbalance
    in Europe. The basis of the project is the regional production of BBFs developing
    demonstration pilots that can be replicated throughout Europe, boosting local
    growth. The project proposes the implementation of 9 technologies in 7 cases in
    6 areas representative of the fisheries sector (North, Baltic, Atlantic, Cantabric,
    Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea). The proposed technologies range from well-known
    processes (bokashi, composting, etc.) that can be a solution in some areas due
    to its low cost and simplicity to others more sophisticated that go from thermo-mechanical
    fractionation to enzymatic hydrolysis. The technologies will be applied to different
    by-products (typical in each implementation area), and they will produce several
    BBFs either for local crops and conditions, and others for exporting (with high
    value and effectiveness to assure a low impact).BBFs will be characterized to
    ensure compliance with EU regulations, including those related to organic farming.
    Besides, the effects on soil biodiversity, environmental sustainability and the
    impact on social parameters and local economy will be studied and business plans
    will be defined. Finally BBFs from by-products will serve to partially replace
    imported nutrients for agriculture in Europe, contributing to reduce the negative
    environmental effects of the misuse of by-products.
