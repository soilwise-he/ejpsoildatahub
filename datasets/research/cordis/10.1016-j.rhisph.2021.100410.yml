  title: Does the exudation of coumarins from Fe-deficient, soil-grown Brassicaceae
    species play a significant role in plant Fe nutrition?
  abstract: "Understanding how plants respond to micronutrient deficiency and which\
    \ biogeochemical processes are induced at the root-soil interface, i.e. the rhizosphere,\
    \ is crucial to improve crop yield and micronutrient grain content for high quality\
    \ food and feed. Iron nutrition by grass species relies on the release and re-uptake\
    \ of phytosiderophores, which are root exudates that form stable complexes with\
    \ Fe but also other trace metals such as Zn and Cu. However, neither the importance\
    \ of phytosiderophores under Zn and Cu deficient conditions nor the interplay\
    \ of plant responses and rhizosphere processes are well understood as the majority\
    \ of studies in the past was carried out under \u2018soil-free\u2019 hydroponic\
    \ conditions. In this project, I aim to elucidate the mechanisms controlling phytosiderophore-mediated\
    \ micronutrient acquisition of barley (Hordeum vulgare) under Zn, Cu, and as reference,\
    \ Fe deficient conditions, with particular emphasis on soil environments. Barley\
    \ is the fifth most produced crop worldwide and of great importance in regions\
    \ that are characterized by harsh living conditions. In a holistic approach, my\
    \ team and I will apply innovative soil-based and traditional hydroponic root\
    \ exudation sampling approaches in combination with advanced plant molecular techniques\
    \ to study the phytosiderophore release and uptake system under different experimental\
    \ conditions. The chemical synthesis of otherwise commercially unavailable phytosiderophores\
    \ in their natural and 13C-labelled form will allow us to trace their decomposition\
    \ and metal solubilizing efficiency in the plant-microbe-soil system to uncover\
    \ the interplay of plant genetic responses and rhizosphere processes affecting\
    \ the time-window of PS-mediated MN acquisition. Moving beyond \u2018soil-free\u2019\
    \ experimental designs of the past, this project will generate key knowledge to\
    \ improve selection of crops with highly efficient micronutrient acquisition traits\
    \ to alleviate micronutrient malnutrition of people world-wide.\n"
