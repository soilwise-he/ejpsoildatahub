  title: Assembled mixed co-cultures for emerging pollutant removal using native microorganisms
    from sewage sludge
  abstract: 'With an increasing world population growth, prediction of climate change
    on the sustainability and resilience of farming ecosystems is key. Since the nitrogen
    cycle''s role within the farming ecosystem is of utmost importance, and an environmental
    disturbance leads to farming production loss, understanding the cycle''s resilience
    is crucial. The main actors within this cycle are microorganisms, yet these are
    ignored when predicting ecological effects to climate change (black box models).
    Microorganisms do not exist as isolated entities, but are mixed in high numbers,
    maintaining a diverse number of social interactions created through adaptation
    and evolution. Microbial-Light will illuminate black box models via the acquisition
    of a multi-parametric database. Physicochemical disturbances will be applied to
    a large combinatorial number of mixed microbial populations of well studied nitrifiers.
    Microbial growth monitoring at microtiter scale will include strain tracking (FISH-flow
    cytometry), while function (i.e. nitrification) will be determined at a larger
    scale. The ample data collected will enable elucidation of functional landscapes
    for each synthetic community under combining environmental stresses. Additionally,
    the role of microbial interactions (BSocial tool) across disturbance gradients
    will be sought. Microbial-Light, will engage in modelling individual growth from
    synthetic mixed population growth, thereby validating the models with previous
    experimental evidence. Moreover, the optimal social nitrifying community will
    be coated on tomato seeds, and plant growth efficiency will be compared with uncoated
    seeds. Parallel to the acquisition multi-parametric database, evaluation of the
    nitrification potential of poor and rich soils will be tested coupled with microbial
    diversity (Illumina sequencing). The analysis of synthetic and natural communities,
    will allow for a more comprehensive ecological model on nitrification.
