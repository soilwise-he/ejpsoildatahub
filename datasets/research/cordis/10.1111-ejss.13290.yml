  title: Post-fire recovery of soil microbial functions is promoted by plant growth
  abstract: "Knowledge gaps on forest soil processes and lack of a harmonised soil\
    \ monitoring limit the EU\u2019s ability to maintain soil related ecosystem services\
    \ and to reach climate policy targets. A better understanding of the soil processes\
    \ and a harmonised approach to manage and integrate data to computational models\
    \ that are used for decision making is urgently required in order to meet climate\
    \ and sustainability goals, including the UN's Agenda 2030 SDGs, the Paris Agreement\
    \ of Climate Convention, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy, the EU's LULUCF Regulation,\
    \ the EU Forest Strategy (2018), and the European Green Deal. HoliSoils will develop\
    \ a harmonised soil monitoring framework and identify and test soil management\
    \ practices aiming to mitigate CC and sustain provision of various ecosystem services\
    \ essential for human livelihoods and wellbeing. HoliSoils incorporates novel\
    \ methodologies and expert knowledge on analytical techniques, data sharing, soil\
    \ properties and biodiversity, and processes with model development, in order\
    \ to develop tools for soil monitoring, refine GHG assessment of the LULUCF sector,\
    \ enhance efficiency of GHG mitigation actions, and improve numerical forecasting\
    \ of soil-based mitigation, adaptation, and ecosystem services. HoliSoils applies\
    \ a collaborative multi-actor approach, in order to maximise its applicability\
    \ and impact beyond its duration. The multidisciplinary consortium consists of\
    \ universities and research institutes from across Europe, with leading expertise\
    \ on soil analysis and databases, development of advanced analytical techniques,\
    \ complex system modelling, digital soil mapping, soil ecology, disturbance ecology,\
    \ forest and GHG inventories, social sciences, and communications. It also involves\
    \ active engagement with diverse stakeholders, including forest owners and managers,\
    \ industry actors, forest extension services, a certification body, forest and\
    \ soil researchers, climate policy support and GHG inventory experts, and policymakers.\n"
