  title: Deep learning with multisite data reveals the lasting effects of soil type,
    tillage and vegetation history on biopore genesis
  abstract: "Future food production relies on efficient water use. This research project\
    \ will focus on optimizing the utilisation of deep stored water in novel emerging\
    \ agronomic systems in both semi-arid and temperate systems that incorporate three\
    \ emerging agronomic interventions that lead to increased systems resilience;\
    \ (i) altered crop phenology (earlier sowing of slower maturing crops); (ii) dual-purpose\
    \ crops (used for grazing and grain); and (iii) summer cover crops. The project\
    \ will utilise novel approaches for continuous deep water sensing to unprecedented\
    \ depths combined with aerial canopy temperature imaging and autonomous root phenotyping\
    \ using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Novel automated data capture on dynamics\
    \ of water availability and deep root growth under various farming practices and\
    \ contrasting soils and environments will also provide a validated dataset for\
    \ model simulation. As a result, the project will contribute to formulation of\
    \ a better decision-support system for farmers and breeders that can assist overcoming\
    \ one of mankind\u2019s greatest challenges. The overall project also aligns with\
    \ the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially, Goal 2 (sustainable agriculture),\
    \ Goal 6 (sustainable water management) and Goal 13 (urgent action for climate\
    \ change) which EU has adopted and committed to implement. As such it is an excellent\
    \ research and training opportunity for a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Global Fellow.\n"
