  title: Selected Simple Natural Antimicrobial Terpenoids as Additives to Control
    Biodegradation of Polyhydroxy Butyrate
  abstract: 'SEALIVE aims at demonstrating innovative circular strategies for bio-based
    plastics in land and sea applications. The project will be driven by economically
    and technically sustainable business models based on materials with advanced properties,
    design for circularity techniques and end-of-life solutions. It will establish
    a partnership of raw material providers, convertors, end users, recyclers, policy
    experts, certification organizations and NGOs to demonstrate solutions within
    a shared vision for circular plastic strategies. Solutions for reusable, recyclable
    and biodegradable bio-based plastics to prevent and significantly reduce marine
    pollution of all kinds will be demonstrated in four pilot territories; Cyprus,
    Ireland, France and Denmark (or Non-European site).  Innovative formulations based
    on PHAs, PLA and starch materials with advanced properties will be developed following
    recycling, biodegradability (marine and land) and composting standards. Design
    for circularity techniques (recyclable multi-layer single packaging materials,
    digital materials for traceability) and End-of-life solutions (high precision
    NIR-based mechanical recycling, controlled biodegradation/composting in natural
    and industrial conditions) will be upscaled at TRL6.  Solutions will be applied
    to 8 end-applications with high potential for pollution reduction of soils and
    water media; rigid food containers, flexible packaging, agricultural films, fish
    crates, fishing nets and aquaculture mesh bags. Pre-normative research will be
    carried out to improve current standards for biodegradation, composting and recycling
    with regards to eco-toxicity, safety and influence of plastic ageing. Policy recommendations
    at EU and global level will be provided in order to build a common framework enabling
    pollution reduction of land and sea via sustainable bio-based plastics solutions.
