  abstract: "Large areas of agricultural terracing have been abandoned and are being\
    \ destroyed in Europe. TerrACE will develop a transferrable methodology of archaeological\
    \ protocols for understanding the creation, maintenance and use of terraces over\
    \ the longue dur\xE9e, thereby informing strategies for the sustainable management\
    \ of these environmental-fragility hotspots. Terraces and lynchets are hallmarks\
    \ of complex Prehistoric to Post-Medieval societies and were critical for the\
    \ sustainability of many European societies (including the Greeks & Romans). However,\
    \ we typically know less about them than any other archaeological site type, although\
    \ they were one of the first transformations of natural into cultural landscapes,\
    \ which in many cases persisted to the 20th century. Key archaeological questions\
    \ are; how old are terrace systems, how were they used, did they reduce soil erosion\
    \ and are they carbon sinks? The answers to these questions have high relevance\
    \ in Europe today as terraces can combine high yields with decreased erosion and\
    \ fire risk, whilst increasing social resilience and food security in the face\
    \ of environmental change.TerrACE will be a step-change in our archaeological\
    \ approach by integrating a raft of new and innovative scientific techniques through\
    \ an exemplary study of the creation, operation and abandonment of terraced landscapes\
    \ on a N-S climatic transect of well-known/excavated terraces across Europe. TerrACE\
    \ has 5 objectives; 1) improving terrace-landscape mapping, 2) multiple dating\
    \ typical terrace systems, 3) determining history of use and management, 4) understanding\
    \ the role of terraces in carbon storage, and 5) outreach to promote terraces\
    \ as part of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Landscapes (UNESCO GIAHS).\
    \ TerrACE is only now feasible due to the development of techniques including\
    \ LiDAR, direct sediment dating, palaeoenvironmental proxies, soil carbon modelling\
    \ and the innovatory use of ancient DNA on terrace palaeosols.\n"
