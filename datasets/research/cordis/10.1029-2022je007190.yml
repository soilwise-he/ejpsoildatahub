  title: "InSight Pressure Data Recalibration, and Its Application to the Study of\
    \ Long\u2010Term Pressure Changes on Mars"
  abstract: "Over the past decades, the robotic exploration of the planet Mars has\
    \ produced a wealth of geological observations. They show that Mars has not always\
    \ been the desert planet of today. It has seen eras conducive to rivers and lakes,\
    \ ice ages, and even periods with a collapsed atmosphere. These different epochs\
    \ are the reason why Mars remains the objective of space agencies, as they evoke\
    \ the possibility of past habitability and spectacular climate changes.Yet, in\
    \ spite of all the data, the climatic processes that have shaped Mars\u2019 surface\
    \ through time remain largely unknown. What happened on Mars? Was the Red Planet\
    \ suitable for life? What explains its evolution?The objective of this project\
    \ is to develop numerical models to simulate the past environments of Mars.A completely\
    \ new \u201CMars Evolution Model\u201D will be created by asynchronously coupling\
    \ hydrology, glacial flows and ground ice models with a new generation 3D Global\
    \ Climate Model (GCM). This GCM will be derived from the one that we have previously\
    \ designed to simulate present day Mars. We will radically update it using new\
    \ technologies to represent the details of the surface as well as all the processes\
    \ that affected Mars when its environment evolved because of the oscillations\
    \ of its orbit and obliquity, during changes in the atmospheric composition, or\
    \ through events like meteoritic impacts or volcanic eruptions. Notably, we will\
    \ highlight the last ten millions years that have been recorded in the polar layered\
    \ deposits, whose formation will be simulated for the first time realistically.These\
    \ new tools will address numerous enigmas found in Mars sciences. They will also\
    \ offer a new platform to study specific processes such as the atmospheric escape\
    \ through time or the chemical alteration of the soil. Furthermore, the project\
    \ will test our capacity to model planetary environments and climate changes,\
    \ as well as provide lessons on the evolution of terrestrial planets and the possibility\
    \ of life elsewhere.\n"
