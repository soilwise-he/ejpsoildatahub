  title: "Value wild animals\u2019 carbon services to fill the biodiversity financing\
    \ gap"
  abstract: "Megafauna play an important role in carbon cycling and fluxes of greenhouse\
    \ gases. Through consumption and excretion of biomass, megafauna accelerate nutrient\
    \ cycling, increasing plant productivity and influencing soil greenhouse gas fluxes.\
    \ Megafauna also emit methane when digesting plants through fermentation. Consequently,\
    \ megafauna can have wide-ranging impacts on ecosystem functioning and climate.\
    \ However, methodological limitations in dynamic global vegetation models and\
    \ research gaps in megafauna ecology hamper our ability to assess these impacts.\
    \ These gaps include; (i) a limited representation of megafauna in vegetation\
    \ models; (ii) a lack of large-scale, long-term studies detailing the influence\
    \ of megafauna on nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes; (iii) insufficient\
    \ knowledge  on how the current loss and introduction of megafauna is affecting\
    \ ecosystems and their services. This project will address these research gaps\
    \ by first developing a new classification of the effects of megafauna across\
    \ biomes for present and late Quaternary species. This classification will then\
    \ be used to simulate megafauna-ecosystem interactions in a dynamic global vegetation\
    \ model (ORCHIDEE). This new tool will allow to test hypothesis on the effect\
    \ of past and present changes in megafauna populations on a) plant primary productivity\
    \ and carbon cycling and b) methane and nitrous oxide fluxes. The proposed project\
    \ has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the connection between\
    \ climate, biosphere, and megafauna. The results will have implication for climate\
    \ policy and conservation. Strong contributions to climate modelling, ecology,\
    \ and paleoecology are to be expected. The candidate\u2019s experience in megafauna-ecosystem\
    \ interactions and ecological modelling, coupled with the host's expertise in\
    \ climate and vegetation model will provide new insights into the role of megafauna\
    \ in past, present, and near future global changes in climate and ecosystems.\n"
