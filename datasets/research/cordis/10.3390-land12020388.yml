  title: 'The Soils of Early Farmers and Their Neighbors in the Southern Buh Catchment
    (Ukraine): Micromorphology and Archaeological Context'
  abstract: 'The project aims at modeling of the early agricultural spread, the process
    that brought agriculture and the settled way of life to large portions of Europe
    in VII-V mill. BC. It is focused on the archaeological record of south of Eastern
    Europe and it will employ innovative way of agent based modeling based on the
    fuzzy sets approach. Fuzzy logic appeared extremely fruitful in modeling processes
    of multi-criteria decision-making. Early farmers faced various ecological, economic
    and social constraints in order to select a certain micro-region for colonization.
    These conditions will be studied in the course of the project by means of database
    approach for the whole south of Eastern Europe (roughly modern south-eastern Poland,
    Ukraine, Moldova, and eastern Romania); taking additional samples for research
    on paleo-soils in the three focus micro-regions which evidenced several waves
    of early agricultural colonization. The criteria will be formulated for a site
    selection by Neolithic farmers. They will be incorporated into agent-based model
    Fuzzy Farmers using a fuzzy sets approach to combine the criteria of various character
    in a single model (for example, type of soil needed and a need of a similar site
    in geographical proximity for exchange of marital partners). Agents will be represented
    by communities of early agriculturalists. The model will simulate the process
    of early agricultural expansion in actual geographic space (modelled in GIS).
    I plan to seek the conditions of ceasing the expansion pace and in such a way
    try to explain the frontiers of early farmers'' spread known from archeological
    record of the south Eastern Europe. The archaeological record of Eastern Europe
    is still badly integrated into pan-European theoretical context. This process
    was hampered by differences in organization of science, financial background and
    research methodologies. The project will work towards the more general aim of
    building a unified European archaeology.
