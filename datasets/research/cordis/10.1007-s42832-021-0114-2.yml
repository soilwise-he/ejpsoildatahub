  title: Tire abrasion particles negatively affect plant growth even at low concentrations
    and alter soil biogeochemical cycling
  abstract: 'A major goal in ecology is to predict how environmental changes, including
    drivers of global change, affect communities and ecosystem functioning, with society
    demanding answers to these pressing questions. A key limitation of virtually all
    experimental approaches addressing such questions is that treatments are delivered
    abruptly, while many changes occurring in nature are gradual. Here I propose to
    comprehensively study consequences of environmental change when delivered abruptly
    vs. gradually. In order to understand and model effects of gradual vs. abrupt
    changes, we need to simultaneously consider physiological effects (e.g. acclimation),
    evolutionary changes (e.g. adaptation) and changes in community composition and
    functioning. Even though changes at these levels likely interact, there is no
    study in which physiology, evolutionary changes and community shifts have been
    studied in response to a changing environmental factor. This research program
    thus enters unchartered territory of empirical environmental research in proposing
    work at this nexus of physiology, environmental change and community composition/
    function. I focus on soil fungi, key players in terrestrial ecosystems, testing
    a range of gradually vs. abruptly changing environmental factors, in a range of
    soils, in the field and in microcosms. We connect differential responses to species
    traits, apply modeling and employ data syntheses across all biomes and organisms
    to achieve high external validity. We carry out a set of core experiments that
    will afford unprecedented insight into the nature of change in a community context
    in response to warming, focusing on soil fungi. In these we follow evolutionary
    change (phenotype and genotype), test physiological shifts by re-isolation of
    fungi and monitor community changes. This work will have transformative character
    in providing not only new mechanistic insights into effects of environmental change,
    but will also represent a step change in fungal ecology.
