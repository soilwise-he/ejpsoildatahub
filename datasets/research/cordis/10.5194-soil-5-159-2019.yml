  title: 'Soil lacquer peel do-it-yourself: simply capturing beauty'
  abstract: "Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of vegetation fires\
    \ around the world. Fire can considerably increase the landscape\u2019s vulnerability\
    \ to flooding and erosion, which is in part caused by fire-induced soil damage\
    \ and hydrological changes. While it is known that plants can alter the fire environment,\
    \ there is a major knowledge gap regarding the fundamental mechanisms by which\
    \ vegetation mediates fire impact on soil physics and hydrology. I will address\
    \ this gap by considering for the first time the cascading effects of plants on\
    \ fire and soil hydrology, focusing on two important factors in post-fire hydrology;\
    \ soil heating and ash. My hypothesis is that plant structural and chemical traits\
    \ vary within the landscape and control fire impact on soil physical properties\
    \ by affecting heat and ash production. I will test this hypothesis with a combination\
    \ of spatial sampling, lab experiments and modeling, using contrasting plant species\
    \ and soils from watersheds in Portugal and the USA. Multiple regression and principal\
    \ component analysis will be used to relate fire impacts to the various plant\
    \ traits. This project can help predict and mitigate fire risk and impact across\
    \ landscapes, facilitate development of risk maps, and generate knowledge with\
    \ implications for nature conservation, land use planning, fire management and\
    \ potential policy making. Aside from helping safeguard soil and (drinking) water\
    \ resources, the project can also change a European braindrain into a braingain,\
    \ supporting reintegration of a successful interdisciplinary scientist and her\
    \ large network after three years in the USA. Additional benefits for Europe include\
    \ transfer of knowledge gained in the USA and knowledge exchange from southern\
    \ to northern member states. Through training and research, this project will\
    \ enhance my success of getting a permanent position in academia and create new\
    \ opportunities to incorporate hydrology and scale in above-belowground interaction\
    \ research.\n"
