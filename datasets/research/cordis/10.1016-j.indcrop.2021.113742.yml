  title: Valorization of wheat bran agro-industrial byproduct as an upgrading filler
    for mycelium-based composite materials
  abstract: 'Approximately one third of all food produced globally is wasted every
    year throughout the whole value chain-from farmers to consumers. To extract the
    significant amounts of valuable compounds contained in these wastes, AgriMax will
    combine affordable and flexible processing technologies (ultrasound assisted and
    solvent extraction, filtration, thermal and enzymatic treatments) for the valorization
    of side streams from the horticultural culture and food processing industry to
    be used in a cooperative approach by local stakeholders.Through the selection
    of case-scenarios previously developed to a pilot scale by the participating RTOs
    and their industrial transfer in new applications as food additives, packaging
    and agricultural materials among others, the project will disclose the holistic
    potential of four new agro-value chains (residues and by products from the culture
    and processing of tomato, cereals, olives, potato). Any by-product generated along
    the production cycle will be valorized in a cascade manner to reach over 40% of
    high value use of the waste. This will lead to additional production of active
    ingredients in lower concentration, but also fibres, biogas and fertilizers from
    the left biomass (the latter with the aim of being used in closed loop in the
    culture of the crops used in the project to prevent soil impoverishing). An LCA
    and LCC will also study the best approach to minimize the environmental impact
    of the new value chains without jeopardizing the cost effectiveness of the operations.
    The pilot multi-feedstock bio-refinery processes will be validated in two demonstration
    sites in Spain and Italy. Societal, ethical, safety, techno-feasibility and regulatory
    aspects will be studied. Last but not least, a business model and platform for
    communication between the potential raw materials suppliers will be set up to
    maximize the use of the cooperative treatment plants throughout the year.
