  title: Convergent evolution of gene regulatory networks underlying plant adaptations
    to dry environments
  abstract: 'Understanding plant development and responses to the environment is key
    for improving crop yields and ensuring food andfuel for the future. Many crop
    species have evolved adaptations that make them more tolerant against abiotic
    stresses, suchas drought, flooding and soil salinity. One of these adaptations
    is the exodermis, a water- and air-proofed cell layer in theroot that protects
    the root from drying and drowning. Although the importance of exodermis for crop
    yield has been shown,the development of exodermis is not understood on molecular
    level, likely due to its absence from the root model speciesArabidopsis. TOMATO
    EXODERMIS aims to elucidate the genes involved in exodermal development and drought
    responses in tomato. To achieve this, novel tools are combined in an efficient
    way to study root development of a crop species in a short timeframe. These tools
    include e.g. bioinformatic analyses of new cell type-specific datasets, rapid
    hairy root cultures and genome editing. TOMATO EXODERMIS will lay a foundation
    for an exodermis research program in European Research Area and generate potential
    for agricultural applications.
