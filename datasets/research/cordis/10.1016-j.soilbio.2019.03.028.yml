  title: Coupled carbon and nitrogen losses in response to seven years of chronic
    warming in subarctic soils
  abstract: 'Global warming can trigger enormous releases of carbon (C) from soils,
    with positive feedbacks to climate change. Northern high latitude soils can constitute
    a major contributor to this positive feedback loop. Climate change predictions
    are however still largely uncertain, partly due the lack of accurate representation
    of vegetation and soil microbial feedbacks and C and nitrogen (N) interactions.
    Warming enhances microbial mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) (i.e. soil
    C outputs) to a higher degree than vegetation productivity (i.e. soil C inputs),
    resulting in large C losses from northern soils. Pioneer results point to proportional
    N losses in response to warming, which may be the key to this phenomenon. This
    project will combine the expertise of a multidisciplinary group of leading researchers
    on ecosystem stoichiometry, stable N isotopic methods and applied biotechnology
    with the existence of unique and established research sites in geothermal systems
    in Iceland to reveal the fate of N lost in response to warming, and uncover the
    mechanisms behind observed soil C losses. StoiCa will elucidate, for first time,
    three key knowledge gaps; (1) the rates, forms and mechanisms of N losses from
    arctic soils under warming; (2) the transient- and persistent responses and the
    warming-induced transitions from a closed to a leaky, open N cycle; (3) the shifts
    towards a more symbiotic N cycle and role of thermo-adapted mycorrhiza in stimulating
    plant growth. This proposal directly addresses two cross-cutting priorities of
    sustainable development and climate action from the H2020 Work Programme. It also
    represents an exceptional opportunity for the candidate to acquire the essential
    skills that she lacks and that will convert her into a highly competitive European
    researcher in climate change biogeochemistry, while obtaining intersectorial capacities
    that will open new career avenues.
