  abstract: 'Pioneer plant species native to tropical ultramafic areas can be useful
    tools for the restoration of ultramafic soils degraded by nickel mining activities.
    Casuarinaceae trees are well known for its capacity to grow on nutrient-poor areas.
    This is possible thanks to multiple adaptations, including the formation of actinorhizal
    symbioses with nitrogen-fixing Frankia actinobacteria. Members of the genera Gymnostoma
    and Ceuthostoma (both from Casuarinaceae) colonise degraded ultramafic soils and
    promote the recovery of soil fertility. However, they produce high amounts of
    slow-degrading litter which (among other effects) reduce the colonisation by other
    plant species.The project CASUABIOTA is intended to improve our knowledge of soil
    biota associated to Casuarinaceae from ultramafic areas of SE Asia. The project
    has two main objectives; 1) to advance our knowledge about Casuarinaceae-associated
    frankiae and its tolerance to nickel, and 2) to obtain insights about the composition
    of Casuarinaceae litter and the organisms involved in its degradation, with a
    special interest in earthworms and saprophytic fungi. To accomplish these objectives,
    a sampling campaign aimed at plants, litter, root nodules and earthworms will
    be performed in ultramafic areas from Sabah State (N of Borneo, Malaysia). Collected
    material will be subjected to different analyses (litter composition, earthworm
    barcoding, soil fungal metabarcoding) and two manipulative experiments on litter
    degradation will be performed on vermireactors and on mesocosms. Expected results
    include the identification of Ni tolerant Frankia strains, the assessment of litter
    effects on the composition of soil fungal and earthworm communities and the optimisation
    of a biological method to accelerate the degradation of Casuarinaceae litter.This
    knowledge will ease the use of Casuarinaceae for the restoration of tropical Ni-mine
    spoils.
