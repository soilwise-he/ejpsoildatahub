  title: "Soil Inoculation with Cyanobacteria: Reviewing Its\u2019 Potential for Agriculture\
    \ Sustainability in Drylands"
  abstract: 'Frequent land degradation problems in drylands make necessary the adoption
    of effective and low cost restoration strategies for a sustainable development
    of these areas. However, water scarcity and low soil fertility inherent to drylands
    make difficult implementation of traditional restoration techniques based on plant
    cover establishment. Recent studies point to the viability of cyanobacteria and
    their secreted exopolysaccharides (EPS) as an eco-friendly biotechnology technique
    for restoration of arid degraded soils. However, cyanobacteria utilization is
    limited due to lack of knowledge regarding the factors involved in the success
    and failure of inoculated cyanobacteria. The general objective of Cyano4REST  is
    cover the gap in knowledge on the relationships between the characteristics of
    the polysaccharidic matrix produced by cyanobacteria in the soils and its role
    in affecting soil hydraulic properties, soil stability and CO2 fluxes in biocrusts.
    The specific objectives are; 1) Identification and culture of cyanobacteria species
    present in biocrusts from different arid and semiarid regions; 2) Chemical and
    macromolecular characterization of the EPS secreted by cyanobacteria species and
    their influence on biocrust development; 3) Analysis of the influence of cyanobacteria
    inoculation on soil properties and CO2 fluxes on different textured soils; 4)
    Cyanobacteria inoculation on soils under field conditions and analysis of their
    influence on soil fertility and stability, soil moisture, and CO2 fluxes. This
    project represent a significant step forward the development of successful strategy
    for soil restoration based on the artificial inoculation of cyanobacteria. Cyano4REST
    will thus increase the European research visibility in the development of new
    biotechnological techniques to promote sustainable development, ensure the protection
    of the environment and combat climate change, one of the priority areas of the
    H2020 program.
