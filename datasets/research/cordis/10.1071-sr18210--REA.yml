  title: Effect of long-term irrigation and tillage practices on X-ray CT and gas
    transport derived pore-network characteristics
  abstract: "The PROTINUS proposal assembles a multi-disciplinary team to combine\
    \ advanced, applied and theoretical research to create a new standard in imaging,\
    \ analysing, modelling and predicting the interactions between soil structure\
    \ and soil functions. Soil structure impacts a whole range of services soil renders\
    \ to ecosystems, including for example contaminant filtering, carbon storage,\
    \ root growth, and microbiological diversity. By using modern imaging, image analysis\
    \ and modelling techniques, we will develop an integrated approach to perform\
    \ experiments in soil physics, bio-chemistry, to reconstruct soil structure in\
    \ 3D and to model soil processes. The evaluated models will be used for predicting\
    \ the different services soil renders to ecosystems in a dynamic way and for testing\
    \ classical theory, where soil structure is not directly taken into account. To\
    \ do so we will bring together the theoretical and practical expertise of the\
    \ involved researchers, infrastructure of the partnering institutes, soil samples\
    \ and databases. The first stage will investigate today\u2019s best practise in\
    \ experimental soil science and imaging, data analysis and modelling. Our findings\
    \ will enable our second stage approach where synergies between the different\
    \ disciplines will be explored. The third stage will provide the cornerstone of\
    \ a new unified methodology meant to modify practise and outcomes of current experimental/imaging,\
    \ analysis and modelling approaches. Our final stage will look at the changes\
    \ brought to each of the specific research area\u2019s practises and how it impacts\
    \ the understanding of soil structure and its functions. It is expected that our\
    \ proposal will foster bilateral collaborations within Europe and with our overseas\
    \ partners through local and international funding, shared database and infrastructure\
    \ management, and lead to the creation of a sustainable international network\
    \ of researchers, infrastructure and institutes.\n"
