  title: 'Numbers in Space: Measuring Living Standards and Regional Inequality in
    the Soviet Union'
  abstract: "The landscape of post-Soviet Central Asia (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrygzstan,\
    \ Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan) is littered with the physical remnants of Soviet development,\
    \ both positive \u2013health clinics and schools \u2013 and negative - decaying\
    \ factories, polluted soil, and dried out rivers. Less visible are Soviet development\u2019\
    s political, intellectual, and institutional legacies.  Yet just as post-socialist\
    \ states and international development organizations have been forced to deal\
    \ with the physical legacies of socialism, their approaches to economic development,\
    \ welfare provision, and governance has been shaped by the socialist past. After\
    \ the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the newly independent states of Central Asia\
    \ invited international institutions and foreign donors to help them achieve prosperity\
    \ and transition to a market economy. At the time, most development institutions\
    \ and national governments subscribed to the so-called \u201CWashington Consensus\u201D\
    \ which emphasized financial discipline, minimum state regulation, and open borders.\
    \ This project proposes to study the influence of Central Asian economists, activists,\
    \ specialists, and government officials who straddled the Soviet/post-Soviet divide\
    \ by going to work in national and international development institutions after\
    \ independence. By studying these individuals and the legacies of their work will\
    \ allow us to investigate how ideas and practices of economic development and\
    \ welfare provision were shaped and reshaped at the local and international level.\
    \ The project will uncover how international development transformed post-Soviet\
    \ Central Asia, and how the encounter with post-socialist states transformed paradigms\
    \ and practices of international development. The research will thus make an innovative\
    \ scholarly contribution to understanding the legacy of socialism, the history\
    \ of economic development, and the the global history of development.\n"
