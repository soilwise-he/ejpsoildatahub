  title: Review on Environmental Sustainability Assessment Methodologies in a Perspective
    of Halophyte-Based Bio-Refinery
  abstract: 'One of the most important challenges of the 21st century is to meet the
    world''s demand for sustainably produced biomass for both food and the growing
    bio-products sector. Increased use of fresh water for agriculture and loss of
    farmland due to salinity are related concerns. Salicornia europaea (S. europaea)
    is grown commercially in the EU for its fresh tips, which are edible as salad
    (marsh samphire). It is a halophyte plant and can grow on saline lands without
    requiring freshwater for irrigation. When grown as a vegetable only the fresh
    tips are used while the woody part of the plant is considered a residue. Today,
    European farmers are using part of the fibrous residue for soil amendment and
    drying the fibers to produce herbal salt. However, the amount of residue to food
    product is large (approximately 80%) and the salt content of the residue is a
    problem when used for soil amendment, as it returns the salt to the soil. There
    is a great wish from Salicornia farmers to increase the value of this fraction
    in line with the principles of circular economy. The woody residue part of Salicornia
    has been investigated as a source of pharma- and nutraceutical products due to
    its high content of phytochemicals e.g. hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA). To help increase
    Salicornia farming there is a wish to valorize these residues via biochemicals
    and bioenergy production. The project will also examine the combination of aquaculture
    and Salicornia farming creating synergies such as formulation and test of phyto-chemicals
    rich functional fish feed and formulation and test of protein and lipids rich
    fish feed. The outcomes of this study will enable Salicornia farmers and aquaponics
    farms to utilize all fractions of the produced biomass and produce value added
    HCAs, functional fish feed, and bioenergy. This will create new circular industries
    with co-production of food, pharma, and bioenergy from this new sustainable type
    of crop with very little or no production of waste streams.
