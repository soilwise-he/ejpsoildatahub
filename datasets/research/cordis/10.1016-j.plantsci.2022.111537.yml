  title: Deficient copper availability on organoleptic and nutritional quality of
    tomato fruit
  abstract: 'Copper (Cu) is a vital micronutrient acting as a double-edged sword in
    living beings because it is an essential redox-active cofactor in biological processes
    but is toxic when in excess. In humans, Cu is acquired by diet and its deficiency
    or excess causes important diseases. Plants are also sensitive to Cu bioavailability
    in soil and their nutritional deficiencies or excesses are transferred to consumers.
    Therefore, deciphering the regulatory mechanisms underlying Cu uptake and distribution
    to edible products is crucial to prevent deficient or toxic Cu levels in horticultural
    crops that may ultimately affect human health. Furthermore, in Europe, around
    20% of the arable land is classified as Cu deficient, which has been compensated
    by using Cu-enriched fertilizers. However, the EU warns that this practice implies
    high environmental costs and compromises food security for consumers. TOMACOP
    will study the effects of Cu deficiency on plant growth and development and on
    fruit nutritional status and quality by using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), one
    of the most important crops worldwide. The characterization of Cu homeostasis
    components and the identification of tissue-specificities in the molecular mechanisms
    regulating Cu uptake will provide important clues for future biotechnological
    improvements aimed to solve the challenge facing EU agriculture.
