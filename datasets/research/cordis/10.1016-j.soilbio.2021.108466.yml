  title: Improved global-scale predictions of soil carbon stocks with Millennial Version
    2
  abstract: "Soil organic matter is the largest land carbon (C) pool, vulnerable to\
    \ land-use change and climate change. Soil C models are used to assess current\
    \ organic C stocks and make predictions under future conditions. These models\
    \ are typically developed to make predictions over centennial timescales. Given\
    \ the \u20184 per mil\u2019 initiative, there is now a critical need for annual-to-decadal\
    \ soil C stock predictions to evaluate land management decisions and hold participants\
    \ accountable to stated goals. The project proposes a new soil model framework\
    \ to make predictions at annual-to-decadal timescales by developing a Bayesian\
    \ forecasting model from a deterministic soil carbon model with the capacity to\
    \ ingest multiple data types, propagate uncertainty from data and parameters into\
    \ predictions, and update predictions when new data become available. The main\
    \ focus is probabilistic prediction of soil C changes under land use and climate\
    \ change for the next two decades. Specifically, the project plans build a forecasting\
    \ model version of the Millennial model, recently developed by the researcher\
    \ with University colleagues. The Millennial model is an evolution of the commonly\
    \ used soil C model Century \u2013 also incorporated in the global land surface\
    \ model (ORCHIDEE) of the host institution (LSCE) - but in contrast to Century,\
    \ Millennial includes soil pools that correspond directly to measurements. First,\
    \ we will develop the Bayesian calibration of modeled temperature response against\
    \ warming experiment data, using the Millennial model to integrate measurements\
    \ from the multi-national, collaborative whole-soil warming experiments FORHOT\
    \ and BBSFA. Then, we will develop the Bayesian calibration of the modeled land\
    \ management response against field data with different amounts and quality of\
    \ added litter. We will then incorporate this new model into ORCHIDEE to predict\
    \ soil C storage for near term land-based mitigation objectives of the Paris Climate\
    \ Agreement.\n"
