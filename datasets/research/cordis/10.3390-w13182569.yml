  title: "Integrated Water Quality Management Model for the Rural Transboundary River\
    \ Basin\u2014A Case Study of the Sutla/Sotla River"
  abstract: 'Natural/Small Water Retention Measures (NSWRMs) can help mitigate the
    conflicts between agricultural water uses (e.g. plant production, animals) and
    other human and environmental demands for water, including drinking water or maintaining
    environmental flow. This is crucial, since these conflicts will be probably exacerbated
    by an increasing number of extreme events such as droughts and heavy rainfall.
    A more careful management of head watersheds will significantly contribute to
    a more resilient agriculture and society. Moreover, NSWRMs are contributing simultaneously
    to the achievement of different Sustainable Development Goals and environmental
    targets formulated in several water- and agriculture-related European Union policies.
    Despite a comprehensive set of techniques available to increase water retention
    on both catchment and farm levels, knowledge is still lacking on the effectiveness
    of different scale- and region-specific measures across various soil-climatic
    regions and agricultural systems, especially under changing climate conditions.
    OPTAIN aims to (i) identify efficient techniques for the retention and reuse of
    water and nutrients in small agricultural catchments across Continental, Pannonian
    and Boreal biogeographical regions of Europe, taking into account potential synergies
    with existing drainage-irrigation systems, and - in close cooperation with local
    actors - (ii) select NSWRMs at farm and catchment level and optimize their spatial
    allocation and combination, based on environmental and economic sustainability
    indicators. By building on existing knowledge and addressing these objectives,
    OPTAIN will improve the Technological Readiness Level of NSWRMs for the benefit
    of both humans and ecosystems. All gained knowledge will be translated into a
    learning environment allowing analysis of trade-offs and synergies between multiple
    values/goals in the management and design of NSWRMs.
