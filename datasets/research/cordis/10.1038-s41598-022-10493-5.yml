  title: Synergistic use of siderophores and weak organic ligands during zinc transport
    in the rhizosphere controlled by pH and ion strength gradients
  abstract: 'Zinc (Zn) deficiency in agricultural soils is leading worldwide to the
    production of stunted rice and to human malnutrition.Some rice varieties take
    up Zn even if it is present in soil in low bioavailable amount, but the underlying
    process is unknown.One mechanism proposed includes the secretion of organic ligands
    (i.e. deoxymugineic acid-DMA), its complexation with Zn in soil and the uptake
    of the complex into the plant. Indirect evidence comes from isotopes studies but
    the direct proof (i.e. measure DMA secretion in soil and DMA complexation with
    Zn in competition with other cations) is missing. To this end, we will determine
    the fluxes of DMA secreted by roots. The challenges are to develop an experimental
    system that reproduces Zn deficiency in laboratory and to develop analytical methods
    that enable the identification and determination of the mass fluxes of DMA. We
    propose to use pot and hydroponic experiments with different Zn supply. The Zn
    deficiency in the soil/solution, will allow us to predict the stimulation of DMA
    production. The latest generation of LC-MS/MS with hugely improved sensitivity
    will be used to quantify the concentrations of DMA and Zn-DMA complexes. Moreover,
    we will establish an accurate stability series for Zn and other cations complexing
    with DMA and we will determine the reaction mechanisms and structure of Zn with
    DMA. The stability series will address the question of whether competition by
    other cations prevents the formation of the Zn-DMA complex in soil. Understanding
    the reaction mechanisms of Zn with DMA and establishing its structure will give
    invaluable insights into the stability of the complexes. We will achieve this
    conducting carefully designed laboratory and theoretical chemistry experiments.
    A prompt application of this research will enable plant breeders to select genes
    to enhance crop production in low Zn conditions.
