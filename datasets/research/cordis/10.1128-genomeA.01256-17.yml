  title: Draft Genome Sequences of Three Terrestrial Isoprene-Degrading Rhodococcus
    Strains
  abstract: 'Isoprene is a very important climate-active biogenic volatile organic
    compound with both global warming and cooling effects. Globally, terrestrial plants
    emit huge amounts (~500-750 million tonnes) of isoprene per year. This is approximately
    the same quantity as methane released to the amosphere. Isoprene emissions are
    predicted to rise due to global warming and increased use of isoprene-emitting
    trees (oil palm, poplar) for biofuel production but almost nothing is known about
    its biogeochemical cycle. Microbes are a sink for isoprene and through their activity
    in soils and on the leaves of isoprene-emitting plants, they will be important
    in removal of isoprene in the biosphere before it gets released to the atmosphere.
    The aim of the project is to obtain a critical, fundamental understanding of the
    metabolism and ecological importance of biological isoprene degradation and to
    test the hypothesis that isoprene degrading bacteria play a crucial role in the
    biogeochemical isoprene cycle, thus helping to mitigate the effects of this important
    but neglected climate-active gas. Key objectives are to elucidate the biological
    mechanisms by which isoprene is metabolised, establish novel methods for the study
    of isoprene biodegradation and to understand at the mechanistic level how isoprene
    cycling by microbes is regulated in the environment. Bacteria that metabolise
    isoprene will be isolated from a range of terrestrial and marine environments
    and characterised using a multidisciplinary approach and a wide range of cutting
    edge techniques. We will elucidate the pathways of isoprene metabolism and their
    regulation by characterising genes/enzymes catalysing key steps in isoprene degradation,
    use innovative molecular ecology methods to determine distribution, diversity
    and activity of isoprene degraders and assess the contribution that microbes make
    in the removal of isoprene from the biosphere, thereby mitigating the effects
    of this climate-active compound.
