  title: Data Assimilation and Online Parameter Optimization in Groundwater Modeling
    Using Nested Particle Filters
  abstract: 'Agricultural production in Europe has significantly damaged soil and
    water resources, ecosystem biodiversity, socio-economic well-being and contributed
    to climate change. Expected further intensification of production to ensure food
    safety for population growth must be sustainable to minimise future impacts and
    negative externalities. This ETN addresses these challenges by training 15 early
    stage researchers in cutting edge research skills and innovative approaches to
    manage soil and groundwater impacts from agriculture for sustainable intensification.
    It supports EU policy goals on food security, resource conservation, renewable
    energy and climate change, and the aims of the H2020 Societal Challenge 5 Work
    Programme for sustainable management of the environment and its resources. The
    scientific objectives focus on developing (1) management techniques which mitigate
    environmental impacts of agricultural practices on soil, water and climate systems,
    and support sustainable intensification using new production methods; (2) smart
    environmental monitoring, biotechnology and modelling tools to predict the outcome
    of measures and practices in (1); (3) decision-making tools with sustainability
    indicators to implement sustainable agricultural production methods. This will
    be achieved by linking lab-scale studies of processes with field-scale evaluation
    of novel management concepts, analytical tools and modelling, using state-of-the-art
    methods. The network includes research, advisory and commercial organisations
    from all sectors of the agri-environmental management community, and SMEs to multinational
    firms. Its novel training agenda of workshops and summer schools on technical
    and business skills, international conferences, industry secondments and knowledge
    transfer activities has the specific aim of transferable skills training. This
    is highly relevant for scientific communication, societal impact and entrepreneurship,
    preparing the fellows for careers in many sectors.
