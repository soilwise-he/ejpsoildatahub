  title: 'DRYP 1.0: a parsimonious hydrological model of DRYland Partitioning of the
    water balance'
  abstract: "Prolonged periods of extreme water scarcity induced by drought are detrimental\
    \ to regional economies through crop and livestock loss, threatening food security\
    \ in rural communities, and making politically unstable regions more vulnerable\
    \ to conflict, terrorism, and mass migration. The rural communities of the Horn\
    \ of Africa Drylands (HAD) are extremely vulnerable to food insecurity and associated\
    \ economic losses during drought conditions due to low socio-economic levels and\
    \ low adaptive capacity to climatic shocks, such that frequent and more severe\
    \ droughts in HAD have dramatically reduced soil moisture and affecting drinking\
    \ water reserves, leading to increased food insecurity, livestock loss, and major\
    \ water shortages. DOWN2EARTH is composed of a multidisciplinary project team\
    \ that will deliver state-of-the-art and community relevant climate services that\
    \ focus on water scarcity and its consequences at or near the Earth\u2019s surface\
    \ (hence DOWN2EARTH) to increasingly vulnerable agro-pastoral populations in HAD.\
    \ The project is designed to bolster existing climate services frameworks, improve\
    \ decision support to governments and NGOs in the most vulnerable HAD countries\
    \ (Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia), and to improve community-centric adaptation and\
    \ resilience to climate change. The project will; assess the socio-economic dimensions\
    \ and human dynamics of climate change including feedbacks between climatic shocks,\
    \ human behavior, and policy implementation; characterize historical trends and\
    \ future projections of water scarcity, food insecurity, population, and land\
    \ use; develop and enhance multi-level decision-support tools that emphasize the\
    \ translation of climate information into critical land and water information\
    \ required for adaptation and resilience by end users and state/regional governments;\
    \ and strengthen regional climate services through capacity building, citizen\
    \ science, information dissemination, expansion of data networks, and policy implementation.\n"
