  title: Hydrogeological investigations of river bed clogging at a river bank filtration
    site along the River Warta, Poland
  abstract: "The AquaNES project will catalyse innovations in water and wastewater\
    \ treatment processes and management through improved combinations of natural\
    \ and engineered components. Among the demonstrated solutions are natural treatment\
    \ processes such as bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge (MAR) and constructed\
    \ wetlands (CW) plus engineered pre- and post-treatment options. The project focuses\
    \ on 13 demonstration sites in Europe, India and Israel covering a repre-sentative\
    \ range of regional, climatic, and hydrogeological conditions in which different\
    \ combined natural-engineered treatment systems (cNES) will be demonstrated through\
    \ active collaboration of knowledge and technology providers, water utilities\
    \ and end-users. Our specific objectives are \u2022 to demonstrate the benefits\
    \ of post-treatment options such as membranes, activated carbon and ozonation\
    \ after bank filtration for the production of safe drinking water \u2022 to validate\
    \ the treatment and storage capacity of soil-aquifer systems in combination with\
    \  oxidative pre-treatments \u2022 to demonstrate the combination of constructed\
    \ wetlands with different technical post- or pre-treatment options (ozone or bioreactor\
    \ systems) as a wastewater treatment option\u2022 to evidence reductions in operating\
    \ costs and energy consumption\u2022 to test a robust risk assessment framework\
    \ for cNES\u2022 to deliver design guidance for cNES informed by industrial or\
    \ near-industrial scale expe-riences\u2022 to identify and profile new market\
    \ opportunities in Europe and overseas for cNESThe AquaNES project will demonstrate\
    \ combined natural-engineered treatment systems as sus-tainable adaptations to\
    \ issues such as water scarcity, excess water in cities and micro-pollutants in\
    \ the water cycle. It will thus have impact across the EIP Water\u2019s thematic\
    \ priorities and cross-cutting issues, particularly on \u2018Water reuse & recycling\u2019\
    , \u2018Water and wastewater treatment\u2019, \u2018Water-energy nexus\u2019,\
    \ \u2018Ecosystem services\u2019, \u2018Water governance\u2019, and \u2018DSS\
    \ & monitoring\u2019.\n"
