  title: Restriction of plant roots in boreal forest organic soils affects the microbial
    community but does not change the dominance from ectomycorrhizal to saprotrophic
    fungi
  abstract: 'Atmospheric concentration of the strong greenhouse gas methane (CH4)
    is rising with an increased annual growth rate. Biosphere has an important role
    in the global CH4 budget, but high uncertainties remain in the strength of its
    different sink and source components. Among the natural sources, the contribution
    of vegetation to the global CH4 budget is the least well understood. Role of trees
    to the CH4 budget of forest ecosystems has long been overlooked due to the perception
    that trees do not play a role in the CH4 dynamics. Methanogenic Archaea were long
    considered as the sole CH4 producing organisms, while new findings of aerobic
    CH4 production in terrestrial vegetation and in fungi show our incomplete understanding
    of the CH4 cycling processes. Enclosure measurements from trees reveal that trees
    can emit CH4 and may substantially contribute to the net CH4 exchange of forests.The
    main aim of MEMETRE project is to raise the process-based understanding of CH4
    exchange in boreal and temperate forests to the level where we can construct a
    sound process model for the soil-tree-atmosphere CH4 exchange. We will achieve
    this by novel laboratory and field experiment focusing on newly identified processes,
    quantifying CH4 fluxes, seasonal and daily variability and drivers of CH4 at leaf-level,
    tree and ecosystem level. We use novel CH4 flux measurement techniques to identify
    the roles of fungal and methanogenic production and transport mechanisms to the
    CH4 emission from trees, and we synthesize the experimental work to build a process
    model including CH4 exchange processes within trees and the soil, transport of
    CH4 between the soil and the trees, and transport of CH4 within the trees. The
    project will revolutionize our understanding of CH4 flux dynamics in forest ecosystems.
    It will significantly narrow down the high uncertainties in boreal and temperate
    forests for their contribution to the global CH4 budget.
