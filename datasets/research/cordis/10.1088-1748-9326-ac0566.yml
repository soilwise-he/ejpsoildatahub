  title: Responses of Arctic cyclones to biogeophysical feedbacks under future warming
    scenarios in a regional Earth system model
  abstract: "CHARTER aims to advance state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge on Arctic biodiversity\
    \ change and social-ecological systems (SES) on four critical fronts; i) Feedbacks;\
    \ To understand transitions in vegetation cover, energy balance and cryospheric\
    \ change at centennial, decadal, and present-day time scales; ii) SES and biodiversity;\
    \ To understand the effects of biodiversity changes on indigenous/local communities\
    \ and traditional livelihoods, e.g. reindeer herding; iii) Modelling; To integrate\
    \ biochemical/permafrost soil carbon exchange, sea ice and albedo into an Earth\
    \ System Model (ESM), and incorporate these into the latest Arctic Regional Climate\
    \ modeling efforts; and iv) Policy; To develop strategies supporting Arctic communities\
    \ with co-benefits and synergies between adaptation, mitigation and policy implications.\
    \ To accomplish these, CHARTER combines expertise from Earth System sciences,\
    \ biodiversity indices and SES research. CHARTER is an ambitious effort to advance\
    \ SOTA modelling of 21st century Arctic change with major socio-economic implications\
    \ and feedbacks for the Cryosphere. We bring together our strongly participatory\
    \ approaches that incorporate indigenous/local communities\u2019 ways of knowing\
    \ regional changes with SOTA research on circumpolar climate dynamics and long-term\
    \ palaeoecological studies. CHARTER collates and processes truly transdisciplinary\
    \ quantitative and qualitative empirical datasets for a holistic view that can\
    \ be modeled. Arctic residents and stakeholders work alongside scientists to identify\
    \ risks and viable adaptation strategies in relation to projected changes and\
    \ future resilience in Arctic SESs. CHARTER combines natural sciences with ESM\
    \ and participatory approaches to leverage the untapped potential for wild ungulate\
    \ and livestock management to regulate global climate feedbacks through biogeoengineering.\
    \ CHARTER\u2019s results will lead to new tools and data for implementing sustainable\
    \ strategies and establish public dialogue on the Arctic.\n"
