  title: Inactivation of an urban wastewater indigenousEscherichia colistrain by cerium
    doped zinc oxide photocatalysis
  abstract: 'In response to the increasing problem of water shortage, the reuse of
    treated urban wastewater is considered the most suitable and reliable alternative
    for sustainable water management and agricultural development. In spite of the
    benefits associated with this practice, major concerns currently exist, related
    to the adverse effects regarding chemical and biological contaminants of emerging
    concern such as antibiotics and mobile antibiotic resistance elements such as
    antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes. These are now considered as
    a serious public health problem by various international organizations and the
    European Commission, because of their spread in the environment, the food chain,
    drinking water, etc. To tackle these problems, scientists with an interdisciplinary
    research/training background are urgently needed. This ETN will train a new generation
    of ESRs to address the risks associated with such contaminants and wastewater
    reuse. Innovative chemical, microbiological, toxicological and modelling tools,
    and novel process engineering will form the scientific and training core of their
    innovative research projects and training. The project will contribute to understanding
    the fate and transmission of antibiotics and resistance from wastewater to the
    environment and humans, through soil, ground/surface water and crops. Relevant
    ELVs will be determined, essential for the development and implementation of regulatory
    frameworks. This project directly tackles these aspects, by bringing together
    a multidisciplinary research team, with the private sector, and policy makers
    and through communication activities towards stakeholders and the wider public.
