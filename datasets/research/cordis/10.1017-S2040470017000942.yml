  title: User requirements for a satellite-based advisory platform
  abstract: "The overall objective of APOLLO is to develop a commercial platform that\
    \ will provide a suite of farm management advisory services specifically designed\
    \ to address the needs of small farmers. APOLLO will use state-of-the-art methodologies\
    \ for the calculation of agricultural parameters based on EO data, taking advantage\
    \ of the improved spatial and temporal coverage of the new Sentinels. APOLLO will\
    \ produce data on agricultural parameters through available EO, meteorological,\
    \ and auxiliary data. Especially for the calculation of soil moisture, SAR images\
    \ will be used for the first time with Sentinel-1, making it possible to obtain\
    \ maps with a spatial and temporal resolution not achievable before. Based on\
    \ the agricultural parameters calculated, a suite of farm management services\
    \ (tillage scheduling, irrigation scheduling, crop growth monitoring, and crop\
    \ yield estimation) will be developed, and will be delivered through a web and\
    \ mobile interface. The service requirements will be elaborated in close collaboration\
    \ with end users. APOLLO services will be cost-effective and affordable, thanks\
    \ to access to free and open Copernicus data, an automated processing chain for\
    \ the delivery of agricultural variables, independence from the need for ground-based\
    \ sensors, and the pioneering use of Sentinel-1 data for estimating soil moisture\
    \ information. The APOLLO platform and business case will be validated through\
    \ pilot testing in Spain, Greece, and Serbia, with the participation of small\
    \ farmers, agricultural consultants, farmers\u2019 associations, and SMEs providing\
    \ farm management services.A business strategy for the take-up of APOLLO will\
    \ be developed, assessing the operational sustainability of the platform based\
    \ on market revenues. According to the preliminary business plan developed, APOLLO\
    \ has the potential for a Return On Investment (ROI) of 18% - 51% in 3 years (for\
    \ the low and high uptake scenario, respectively).\n"
