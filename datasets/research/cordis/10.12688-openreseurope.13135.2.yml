  title: A Google Earth Engine-enabled Python approach for the identification of anthropogenic
    palaeo-landscape features
  abstract: 'The HiLSS Project aims to investigate the relationships between sustainability
    and landscape heritage with particular reference to soil loss and degradation
    over the long term. The project will take a multidisciplinary approach that combines
    archaeology, Historical Landscape Characterisation (HLC), geosciences, and computer-based
    geospatial analysis (GIS - Geographical Information Systems) and modelling (RUSLE
    - Revisited Universal Soil Loss Equation). The research objectives of the HiLSS
    project are to quantify the impact of human activities during the Late Holocene
    in order to create spatial models which can inform the development of sustainable
    conservation strategies for rural landscape heritage.This project will focus on
    two mountainous regions that present historical and cultural similarities but
    located in different climatic zones of Europe (1- Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, Italy;
    2- Northern-mid Galicia, Spain). In previous HLC studies, land-use has been evaluated
    from the perspective of cultural heritage, whereas RUSLE have used it as a proxy
    for the land-cover of an area and its effect on soil erosion. The HiLSS project
    will propose an innovative methodology that combines both the historic/cultural
    values and the environmental values of land-use to inform development of a model
    for the sustainable conservation. By considering the different agricultural land-use
    HLC types in GIS-RUSLE modelling, it will be possible to quantify the effect on
    soil loss for each HLC type and consequently to devise more environmentally sustainable
    management for each type. Environmental sustainability and historic landscape
    conservation are typically treated as two separate fields, but the HiLSS project
    will develop a transformative model for interdisciplinary research, proposing
    a new way to embrace both cultural and natural values as components of the same
    landscape management plans.
