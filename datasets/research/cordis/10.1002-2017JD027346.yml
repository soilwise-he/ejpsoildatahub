  title: "Soil Moisture\u2010Temperature Coupling in a Set of Land Surface Models"
  abstract: 'Droughts cause agricultural loss, forest mortality and drinking water
    scarcity. Their predicted increase in recurrence and intensity poses serious threats
    to future global food security. Several historically unprecedented droughts have
    already occurred over the last decade in Europe, Australia and the USA. The cost
    of the ongoing Californian drought is estimated to be about US$3 billion. Still
    today, the knowledge of how droughts start and evolve remains limited, and so
    does the understanding of how climate change may affect them.Positive feedbacks
    from land have been suggested as critical for the occurrence of recent droughts;
    as rainfall deficits dry out soil and vegetation, the evaporation of land water
    is reduced, then the local air becomes too dry to yield rainfall, which further
    enhances drought conditions. Importantly, this is not just a ''local'' feedback,
    as remote regions may rely on evaporated water transported by winds from the drought-affected
    region. Following this rationale, droughts self-propagate and self-intensify.However,
    a global capacity to observe these processes is lacking. Furthermore, climate
    and forecast models are immature when it comes to representing the influences
    of land on rainfall. Do climate models underestimate this land feedback? If so,
    future drought aggravation will be greater than currently expected. At the moment,
    this remains largely speculative, given the limited number of studies of these
    processes.I propose to use novel in situ and satellite records of soil moisture,
    evaporation and precipitation, in combination with new mechanistic models that
    can map water vapour trajectories and explore multi-dimensional feedbacks. DRY-2-DRY
    will not only advance our fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms triggering droughts,
    it will also provide independent evidence of the extent to which managing land
    cover can help ''dampen'' drought events, and enable progress towards more accurate
    short-term and long-term drought forecasts.
