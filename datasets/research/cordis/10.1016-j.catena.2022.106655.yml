  title: Unravelling the role of soil microflora from micro and macro aggregates in
    plant growth during primary and secondary successions
  abstract: "One of the most challenging tasks in ecology is to reclaim landscapes\
    \ being disturbed by anthropogenic activities. Many human endeavours have been\
    \ put forth for improving microbial activities and their structures, soil organic\
    \ carbon level and plant reestablishment after depleting the top earth. Global\
    \ use of pyrogenic carbon shows promising prospect on C sequestration and soil\
    \ restoration, but there is a noticeable delayed advancement in improving its\
    \ benefits. In accordance to UN Climate Smart Agriculture and UN Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals, this project will seek a novel strategy for soil restoration by using\
    \ pyrogenic carbon and core microbial communities (CBMs), to gain multiple benefits\
    \ including aspects of waste management, C sequestration and plant regeneration.\
    \ The project will make use of unique habitats for CBMs selection at both a long-term\
    \ natural successional post mining site and a well-recorded reclaimed meadow in\
    \ Czech Republic, Central Europe. The main objective of this project is to assess\
    \ if pyrogenic carbon could ensure the function of CBMs during their transplantations\
    \ from donor to recipient soils; 1) disentangle the \u2018refuge\u2019 effect\
    \ of pyrogenic carbon on CBMs from macro-fauna by isotopic analysis, and microbial\
    \ oxidation effect on pore structures and hydrophobicity of pyrogenic carbon,\
    \ and 2) clarify the compositions of CBMs and their functions to responsive plant\
    \ species in undeveloped soils. The transfer of knowledge between the host institution\
    \ and the candidate will pave a solid way for the researcher\u2019s scientific\
    \ career, and future collaborations between the researcher, the host and the secondment\
    \ are foreseen. Altogether, this project will provide a promising potential to\
    \ increase the competitiveness of EU in using bio-wastes and soil inoculants for\
    \ circular economy by bridging in waste management and soil restoration.\n"
