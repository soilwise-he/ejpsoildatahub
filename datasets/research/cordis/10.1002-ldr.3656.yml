  title: Herbivores stimulate respiration from labile and recalcitrant soil carbon
    pools in grasslands of Yellowstone National Park
  abstract: 'Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes the largest C stocks in the terrestrial
    ecosystems, playing critical roles in maintaining agricultural sustainability
    and in potentially mitigating climate change. However, there is a potential conflict
    between SOC storage and agricultural activities, since many traditional intensive
    cultivation methods have led to significant reductions in SOC storage. In this
    project, we will investigate the effects and driving mechanisms of innovative
    cropping systems on biomass production and SOC stocks simultaneously based on
    ongoing long-term unique field experiments on innovative cropping systems available
    at the host department. Multiple research methods will be utilized in this project,
    including data mining of long-term data records, inverse modelling and soil incubation,
    meta-analysis, and structure equation modelling. Our key objective is developing
    innovative cropping systems that allow to protect and increase SOC stocks while
    increasing biomass production under climate change. Results from the current study
    will provide crucial information for policy developments and will contribute to
    the development of sustainable cropping systems for farmers of the future.
