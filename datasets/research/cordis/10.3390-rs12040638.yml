  title: Historical Aerial Surveys Map Long-Term Changes of Forest Cover and Structure
    in the Central Congo Basin
  abstract: 'The African rainforest, is the second largest on Earth, covers ~630 million
    ha and stores up to 66 Pg of carbon and is presently a persistent carbon sink.
    In addition, African rainforest support the forestry sector which contributes
    3-6% of the gross domestic product across the Congo Basin with most foreign export
    directed to Europe. As such, African rainforest currently represents both a local
    and foreign economic driver and provides important ecosystem services through
    the negative feedback on the global carbon cycle. Both remote sensing data and
    tree ring stable isotope measurements have shown that these forests are currently
    being subjected to a long-term drying trend, raising fears over the drought resilience
    of tropical tree species and the persistence and magnitude of this important terrestrial
    carbon sink. Here, we combine eco-physiological and dendrochronological research
    with a model based approach to increase our understanding of the response of African
    tropical tree species under changing climatological conditions across the central
    Congo Basin. We will integrate several data streams including inventory data on
    soil properties and associated leaf traits, wood traits, phenology, retrospective
    dendrochronology and wood core stable isotope and calcium tracer time series,
    in order to constrain a data-informed mechanistic ecosystem model (MuSICA). Using
    a novel tracer experiment we will corroborate the use of a calcium [Ca] tracer
    in tropical tree species for rapid dating and eco-physiological research into
    drought resistance. Accurate model predictions, based upon Ca tracer measurements
    made during this action, will provide estimates of the vulnerability of tree species
    to future drought conditions. Our results will have important policy implications
    as the demise of important tree species could have significant effects on ecosystem
    services, e.g. affecting the carbon balance, as well as a direct economic impact
    on sustainable local and EU timber trade.
