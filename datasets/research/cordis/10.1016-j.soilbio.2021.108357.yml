  title: A critical perspective on interpreting amplicon sequencing data in soil ecological
    research
  abstract: "Microbial turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) is key for the terrestrial\
    \ carbon (C) cycle. Its underlying mechanisms, however, are not fully understood.\
    \ The role of soil microbes for organic matter turnover has so far been studied\
    \ mainly from the point of view of microbial physiology, stoichiometry or community\
    \ composition. I propose to shed new light on it from the perspective of complex\
    \ systems science.Microbial decomposition of organic matter requires the concerted\
    \ action of functionally different microbes interacting with each other in a spatially\
    \ structured environment. From complex systems theory, it is known that interactions\
    \ among individuals at the microscale can lead to an \u2018emergent\u2019 system\
    \ behavior, or \u2018self-organisation\u2019, at the macroscale, which adds a\
    \ new quality to the system that cannot be derived from the traits of the interacting\
    \ agents. Importantly, if microbial decomposer systems are self-organised, they\
    \ may behave in a different way as currently assumed, especially under changing\
    \ environmental conditions.The aim of this project is thus to investigate i) if\
    \ microbial decomposition of organic matter is driven by emergent behaviour, and\
    \ ii) what consequences this has for soil C and nitrogen cycling. Combining state-of-the-art\
    \ methods from soil biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, and complex systems science\
    \ I will\u2022 Investigate mechanisms of spatial self-organization of microbial\
    \ decomposer communities by linking microscale observations from experimental\
    \ microcosms to mathematical, individual-based modelling,  \u2022 Elucidate microbial\
    \ interaction networks across the soil\u2019s microarchitecture by linking microbial\
    \ community composition, process rates and chemical composition of spatially explicit\
    \ soil micro-units at an unprecedented small and pertinent scale. \u2022 Explore\
    \ fundamental patterns of self-organisation by applying the framework of complex\
    \ systems science to high-resolution spatial and temporal data of soil microstructure\
    \ and process rates.\n"
