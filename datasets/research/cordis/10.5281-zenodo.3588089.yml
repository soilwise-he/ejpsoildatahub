  title: "Closing nutrient & carbon loops \u2013 comparison on investigated innovations\
    \ between CIRCULAR AGRONOMICS and NUTRI2CYCLE projects"
  abstract: 'Circular Agronomics (CA) provides a comprehensive synthesis of practical
    solutions to improve the current Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) cycling
    in European agro-ecosystems and related up- and down-stream processes within the
    value-chain of food production. The proposed solutions would constitute a further
    step towards making agriculture an integral part of a circular economy by increasing
    resource efficiency while simultaneously addressing associated environmental challenges
    such as greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions as well as eutrophication of water
    bodies. Along 7 work packages and 6 case-studies, representing locations with
    different biogeographic conditions and environmental challenges typical for the
    European agricultural sector, the objective of CA is to contribute to a development
    towards sustainable, resilient and inclusive economies that are part of circular
    and zero-waste societies. The involved multi-actor and international consortium
    aims (i) To increase the understanding of C, N, P flows and the related potential
    to reduce environmental impacts at farm and regional level under different bio-geographical
    conditions; (ii) To close loops within cropland farming, from livestock to cropland
    farming and to increase the reuse of waste/wastewater from food-industry to improve
    soil fertility and to increase nutrient use efficiency; (iii) To highlight the
    performance of different prototypes of agro-ecological systems and increase sustainability
    of food production in the EU; and (iv) To contribute to the improvement of the
    European Agricultural Policies by providing evidence based, farmer led and consumer
    relevant recommendations for the agri-food chain. Cross-cutting social, economic
    and environmental evaluation ensure the overall sustainability of the investigated
    solution.
