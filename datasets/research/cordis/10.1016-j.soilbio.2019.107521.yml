  title: Soil multifunctionality is affected by the soil environment and by microbial
    community composition and diversity
  abstract: "Soils are considered the last scientific frontiers that harbor one of\
    \ the most diverse microbial communities on Earth. It is hypothesized that this\
    \ diversity allows for redundancy in microbial key processes, thereby ensuring\
    \ ecosystem stability. Much of this functional redundancy is embodied in non-active,\
    \ dormant microorganisms that represent the \u2018microbial seed bank\u2019, which\
    \ is characterized by a high number of low abundant taxa. Based on the recent\
    \ theory of a \u2018dynamic rank-abundance curve\u2019, it is hypothesized that\
    \ the rare dormant organisms can be recruited to participate in a given function\
    \ upon resuscitation with environmental cue(s). In this project I will test this\
    \ hypothesis on a level that matters for ecosystem processes \u2013 the functional\
    \ level \u2013 by an innovative approach combining stable isotope probing (SIP)\
    \ and sequencing with process-level and single-cell activity analysis.By testing\
    \ 4 hypotheses, we will (1) reveal environmental cues that resuscitate dormant\
    \ microorganisms involved in major soil functions and identify the activated microorganisms.\
    \ The activity of the resuscitated communities will be analyzed at the process\
    \ level, as well as at the single-cell by NanoSIMS, thereby allowing us to elucidate\
    \ the impact of dormancy/resuscitation dynamics on targeted processes at the population\
    \ and ecosystem level. (2) We will investigate the genetics of microbial dormancy-resuscitation\
    \ strategies in a natural model environment for dormancy, an arid ecosystem, by\
    \ metatranscriptome analysis of critical dormancy-resuscitation steps. (3) We\
    \ will retrieve genomic information of primarily rare, but after resuscitation\
    \ active, microorganisms involved in important soil processes, as they presumably\
    \ contain so far unknown genomic potential. In summary, this project will generate\
    \ essential knowledge on the stability of microbial key processes and on the diversity,\
    \ the function and the genetics of the dormant majority in terrestrial ecosystems.\n"
