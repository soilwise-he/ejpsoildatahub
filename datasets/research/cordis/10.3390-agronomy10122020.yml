  title: Andean Lupin Phenology and Agronomic Performance under Different Planting
    Dates in a Mediterranean Climate
  abstract: "The Andes Lupin (Lupinus mutabilis, tarwi) grows excellently in marginal\
    \ lands due to it\xB4s excellent foraging characteristics having the ability to\
    \ fix nitrogen, mobilise soil phosphate and have low nutritional requirements\
    \ for cultivation. For the increased biomass needed in Europe in coming years\
    \ and decades we cannot rely on the most fertile lands, which is currently allocated\
    \ to food production, we need to increase the yield from marginal lands. There\
    \ the lupin varieties are preponderant, the one providing highest yield (up to\
    \ 80 ton/ha) is Lupinus mutabilis. Varieties can be chosen for giving this high\
    \ yield of green silage or high yield of seeds contain more than 20% oil, more\
    \ than 40% protein and the remainder carbohydrates are mainly oligosaccharides\
    \ characterized as \u201Cprebiotics\u201D. Andes lupin can be grown as a summer\
    \ crop in N-central Europe conditions and as winter crop in Mediterranean conditions.\
    \  Breeding and cropping research is performed in the LIBBIO project for maximizing\
    \ the yield and value of lupin agriculture in different European marginal lands\
    \ conditions, with respect to both the farmers and biorefineries. Pre-industrial\
    \ processing is developed and optimized for the lupin, properties of the different\
    \ fractions analysed, their advantage for different industrial use evaluated,\
    \ and a few products developed as an example. With respect to environmental impact\
    \ the lupin is expected to be superior. It does not need much fertilizer, it enriches\
    \ the soil with nitrogen and phosphate and is therefore expected to be excellent\
    \ for crop rotation and soil regeneration. These properties will be evaluated\
    \ further in the project along with techno-economic and agricultural viability\
    \ and effect on farm and biorefinery income.\n"
