  title: "Acclimation of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound Emission From Subarctic\
    \ Heath Under Long\u2010Term Moderate Warming"
  abstract: "Arctic is warming at approximately twice the global speed, which could\
    \ result in drastic changes in the arctic biosphere as well as its potential feedbacks\
    \ to the atmosphere.  Several important but uncertain feedbacks are related to\
    \ biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions from arctic plants and\
    \ high organic soils. BVOC influence climate systems through changing atmospheric\
    \ compositions (oxidant and aerosols); however, the magnitudes and directions\
    \ of these feedbacks are still poorly quantified for the Arctic. This project,\
    \ MABVOC, aims to quantify BVOC emissions for the pan-Arctic region by using a\
    \ process-based dynamic ecosystem model (LPJ-GUESS), combined with leaf, soil\
    \ and ecosystem levels observations from the Arctic, and to further predict potential\
    \ changes of emissions under climate change. A series of model developments will\
    \ be proposed in this project to explicitly consider arctic plants emission features\
    \ as well as soil BVOC dynamics. The host group, conducting large and novel field\
    \ observations about arctic BVOC, will provide needed field data and frontier\
    \ understanding that will be implemented in the model. I will combine my expertise\
    \ in arctic ecosystem modelling to numerically link BVOC fluxes with different\
    \ ecosystem processes, which enables me to provide quantifications of different\
    \ factors\u2019 impacts on emissions to the host group. The high degree of complementary\
    \ expertise between the host and I will guarantee the quality and smoothness of\
    \ this project.  The updated emission estimates from the Arctic will pave a way\
    \ for reassessing arctic BVOC-mediated feedbacks to the climate system. Furthermore,\
    \ the proposed model developments in this project will be transferable to the\
    \ larger modelling community to reduce uncertainties in arctic applications. The\
    \ integration of experiences between field investigators and ecosystem modellers\
    \ in this project will lead to a productive and valuable exchange of knowledge\
    \ on both sides.\n"
