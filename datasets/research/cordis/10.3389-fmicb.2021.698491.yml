  title: Current Methods, Common Practices, and Perspectives in Tracking and Monitoring
    Bioinoculants in Soil
  abstract: 'Fungi and bacteria are utilised for the production of microbial-based
    fertilisers and pesticides worldwide. These bioinoculants have a huge potential
    in agriculture because they can help to increase crop yields and quality and allow
    a reduction in the application of chemicals. While the effectiveness of bio-inoculants
    as bio fertilisers or biopesticides is widely tested for crop yield and pathogens
    control, little is known about the effect of bioinoculants on microbial assemblages
    in the non-rhizospheric soil of agroecosystems. A sudden artificial introduction
    of a fungal species in soil could create a substantial impact on the biodiversity
    of endemic microbial species and local community functions, as well as lead to
    changes in the food webs and nutrients availability. ALIENinSoil will, therefore,
    assess the impact of a fungal inoculum, the globally-used biofertiliser Trichoderma
    afroharzianum T22, on microbial assemblages of a model soil system. The project
    will apply an innovative rapid metagenomic approach based on long-read Oxford
    Nanopore Technology to assess the effects of the fungal inoculum on soil microbial
    communities and functions in a laboratory-based microcosms experiment. Thus, this
    project will use innovative and cutting-edge techniques to understand 1) to what
    extent the native microbial community richness and relative abundance is influenced
    by a competitive fungal strain introduced to soil; 2) whether or not the keystone
    microbial taxa are resilient to the disturbance by the introduced fungus 3) how
    far the bioinoculant impacts the functions of soil microorganisms. With this action,
    I want to acquire new in-depth knowledge necessary to stimulate innovation in
    the field of soil bioinoculants and agriculture by way of competitive technology
    transfer. Oxford Nanopore sequencing has great potential to be used for real-time
    diagnostics in agricultural surveys and the development of indicators for monitoring
    soil biodiversity and functionality.
