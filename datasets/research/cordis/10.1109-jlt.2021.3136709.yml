  title: Magnetic-Based Polydimethylsiloxane Cap for Simultaneous Measurement of Magnetic
    Field and Temperature
  abstract: "The key research goal of the project \u201CAdvanced 2D-material integrated\
    \ photonics technologies for bio sensing (NanoIP-BioS)\u201D is to enhance the\
    \ leadership and research capability of the Marie Curie Fellow Dr Bing Sun, via\
    \ implementing a highly challenging and innovative research project focused on\
    \ the development of high sensitive and selective photonic biosensors by exploring\
    \ two-dimensional (2D)-nanomaterial, i.e. graphene oxide (GO), black-phosphorus\
    \ (BP) and MXene, and fibre microsensor structures for applications in food and\
    \ water safety, environmental monitoring, and healthcare sectors. 2D-material\
    \ have received significant attentions due to their unique mechanical, electronic,\
    \ optical and chemical properties. Especially, black-phosphorus and MXene are\
    \ a new family of 2D transition-metals that are analogous to graphene oxide. Because\
    \ of their easy availability, hydrophilic behaviour, and tunable chemistry, graphene\
    \ oxide, black-phosphorus and MXene have been recently explored for environmental\
    \ pollution remediation such as heavy metal ions detection in water, soil, air\
    \ and so on. This project will exploit new emerging opportunities with the integration\
    \ of photonic technologies (fibre gratings, fibre tapers, photonic crystal fibres,\
    \ fibre lasers) and advanced 2D-material (GO , MXene , BP ) to develop a range\
    \ of new, highly sensitive, label-free, rapid and promising performance photonic\
    \ biosensors to address EU and WHO raised issues in water and food safety and\
    \ general public health care. The Fellow Dr Bing Sun from Nanjing University of\
    \ Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), China, will be trained in the fast growing\
    \ photonics science, technology and application area at the host - Aston Institute\
    \ of Photonic Technologies (AIPT, supervisor; Prof Lin Zhang, Female), Aston University,\
    \ UK, with further two EU academic institutes (Aalto University Finland, Valencia\
    \ University Spain) and two industry companies (Arden Photonics UK and VTT Finland).\n"
