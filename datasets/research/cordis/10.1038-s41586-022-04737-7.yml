  title: Tropical tree mortality has increased with rising atmospheric water stress
  abstract: 'Tropical forests represent key terrestrial ecosystems for carbon stocks
    and biodiversity. The dynamics of carbon storage in forests are primarily driven
    by tree performance in terms of mortality and growth. But climate change is rapidly
    altering tree performance, with important consequences for carbon cycle, climate
    regulation and biodiversity. Yet, we are still lacking accurate predictions of
    the response of tropical forest in terms of their composition, dynamics and functions
    to altered climate. While demographic approaches have traditionally focused on
    how individual performance vary with ontogeny or size, trait-based approaches
    have often focused on how morphological or physiological properties of individuals
    (traits) change with abiotic and biotic factors and links to performance. Though
    the link between traits and performance influences population dynamics and subsequent
    community structure and ecosystem functions, we still understand very little about
    the drivers shaping the trait-performance relationship. With tropical forests
    facing rapidly changing abiotic and biotic conditions with global changes, we
    need a better mechanistic understanding of tropical tree growth and mortality
    response to the interplay of traits with abiotic and biotic factors. The proposed
    project will yield a major contribution to this goal by using state-of-the-art,
    powerful modelling approaches with unprecedented demographic data spanning over
    40 years and  leaf and wood economics and hydraulics traits of over 700 tropical
    tree species distributed in 74 forest plots along broad soil and climatic gradients
    on four continents. Our results will bring a mechanistic understanding of how
    the interplay of species traits, tree size, climate, soil, and biotic interactions
    impact tree growth and mortality rates in tropical forests, while disentangling
    region-specific from pantropical effects.
