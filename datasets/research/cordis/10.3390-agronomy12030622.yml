  title: 'Innovative Living Mulch Management Strategies for Organic Conservation Field
    Vegetables: Evaluation of Continuous Mowing, Flaming, and Tillage Performances'
  abstract: "IWMPRAISE aims to support the implementation of Integrated Weed Management\
    \ (IWM). IWMPRAISE will demonstrate that adoption of IWM supports more sustainable\
    \ cropping systems both agronomically and environmentally, which are resilient\
    \ to external impacts without jeopardising profitability or the steady supply\
    \ of food, feed and biomaterials. IWMPRAISE aims to develop, test and assess management\
    \ strategies delivered across whole cropping systems for four contrasting management\
    \ scenarios representing typical crops in Europe. The specific objectives are\
    \ to 1) quantify and address current socio-economic and agronomic barriers to\
    \ the uptake of IWM 2) develop and optimise novel alternative weed control methods\
    \ and create a \u2018tool box\u2019 of validated IWM methods 3) design, demonstrate\
    \ and assess the performance and environmental and economic sustainability of\
    \ IWM strategies and 4) make results available to end users. The development of\
    \ IWM strategies are supported by WPs delivering practical knowledge and tools\
    \ as well as knowledge and tools for assessing and disseminating the strategies,\
    \ ensuring a vertical integration of the project. One WP is devoted to to the\
    \ complex interaction between soil tillage, weed management and soil fertility.\
    \ IWMPRAISE provides advances beyond the state-of-the-art within several areas\
    \ ensuring that the overall goal of the project, to provide practical solutions\
    \ to the end users, will be fulfilled. IWMPRAISE combines activities centred around\
    \ R & D providing the tools for developing IWM strategies with activities that\
    \ adopt the \u201Cinteraction innovation model\u201D involving end users and other\
    \ actors in a partnership with public research institutes and private SMEs adopting\
    \ a truly multi-actor approach. IWMPRAISE combines innovation potential for novel\
    \ and sustainable weed management methods with implementation potential and will\
    \ therefore address and provide impact within all areas listed in the call.\n"
