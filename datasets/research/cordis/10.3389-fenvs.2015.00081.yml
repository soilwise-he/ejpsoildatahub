  title: 'Making the Most of Our Land: Managing Soil Functions from Local to Continental
    Scale'
  abstract: "LANDMARK is a pan-European multi-actor consortium of leading academic\
    \ and applied research institutes, chambers of agriculture and policy makers that\
    \ will develop a coherent framework for soil management aimed at sustainable food\
    \ production across Europe.The LANDMARK proposal builds on the concept that soils\
    \ are a finite resource that provides a range of ecosystem services known as \u201C\
    soil functions\u201D. Functions relating to agriculture include; primary productivity,\
    \ water regulation & purification, carbon-sequestration & regulation, habitat\
    \ for biodiversity and nutrient provision & cycling. Trade-offs between these\
    \ functions may occur; for example, management aimed at maximising primary production\
    \ may inadvertently affect the \u2018water purification\u2019 or \u2018habitat\u2019\
    \ functions. This has led to conflicting management recommendations and policy\
    \ initiatives. There is now an urgent need to develop a coherent scientific and\
    \ practical framework for the sustainable management of soils.LANDMARK will uniquely\
    \ respond to the breadth of this challenge by delivering (through multi-actor\
    \ development);1. LOCAL SCALE; A toolkit for farmers with cost-effective, practical\
    \ measures for sustainable (and context specific) soil management.2. REGIONAL\
    \ SCALE - A blueprint for a soil monitoring scheme, using harmonised indicators;\
    \ this will facilitate the assessment of soil functions for different soil types\
    \ and land-uses for all major EU climatic zones.3. EU SCALE \u2013 An assessment\
    \ of EU policy instruments for incentivising sustainable land management.There\
    \ have been many individual research initiatives that either address the management\
    \ & assessment of individual soil functions, or address multiple soil functions,\
    \ but only at local scales. LANDMARK will build on these existing R&D initiatives;\
    \ the consortium partners bring together a wide range of significant national\
    \ and EU datasets, with the ambition of developing an interdisciplinary scientific\
    \ framework for sustainable soil management.\n"
