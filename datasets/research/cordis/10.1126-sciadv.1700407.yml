  title: Early formation of planetary building blocks inferred from Pb isotopic ages
    of chondrules
  abstract: "The objectives of this proposal, PRISTINE (high PRecision ISotopic measurements\
    \ of heavy elements in extra-Terrestrial materials; origIN and age of the solar\
    \ system volatile Element depletion), are to develop new cutting edge high precision\
    \ isotopic measurements to understand the origin of the Earth, Moon and solar\
    \ system volatile elements and link their relative depletion in the different\
    \ planets to their formation mechanism. In addition, the understanding of the\
    \ origin of the volatile elements will have direct consequences for the understanding\
    \ of the origin of the Earth\u2019s water. To that end, we will approach the problem\
    \ from two angles; 1) Develop and use novel stable isotope systems for volatile\
    \ elements (e.g. Zn, Ga, Cu, and Rb) in terrestrial, lunar and meteoritic materials\
    \ to constrain the origin of solar system\u2019s volatile element depletion 2)\
    \ Determine the age of the volatile element depletion by using a novel and original\
    \ approach; calculate the original Rb/Sr ratio of the Solar Nebula by measuring\
    \ the isotopic composition of the Sun with respect to Sr via the isotopic composition\
    \ of solar wind implanted in lunar soil grains.The stable isotope composition\
    \ (goal #1) will give us new constraints on the mechanisms (e.g. evaporation following\
    \ a giant impact or incomplete condensation) that have shaped the abundances of\
    \ the volatile elements in terrestrial planets, while the timing (goal #2) will\
    \ be used to differentiate between nebular events (early) from planetary events\
    \ (late). These new results will have major implications on our understanding\
    \ of the origin of the Earth and of the Moon, and they will be used to test the\
    \ giant impact hypothesis of the Moon and the origin of the Earth\u2019s water.\n"
