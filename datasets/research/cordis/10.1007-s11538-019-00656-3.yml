  title: Multiple Scale Homogenisation of Nutrient Movement and Crop Growth in Partially
    Saturated Soil
  abstract: 'We rely on soil to support the crops on which we depend. Less obviously
    we also rely on soil for a host of ''free services'' from which we benefit. For
    example, soil buffers the hydrological system greatly reducing the risk of flooding
    after heavy rain; soil contains very large quantities of carbon, which would otherwise
    be released into the atmosphere where it would contribute to climate change. Given
    its importance it is not surprising that soil, especially its interaction with
    plant roots, has been a focus of many researchers. However the complex and opaque
    nature of soil has always made it a difficult medium to study.In this ERC research
    program I will develop a state of the art image based model of the physical and
    chemical properties of soil and soil-root interactions, i.e., a quantitative,
    model of the rhizosphere based on fundamental scientific laws. This will be realised
    by a combination of innovative, data rich fusion of structural and chemical imaging
    methods, integration of experimental efforts to both support and challenge modelling
    capabilities at the scale of underpinning bio-physical processes, and application
    of mathematically sound homogenisation/scale-up techniques to translate knowledge
    from rhizosphere to field scale. The specific science questions I will address
    with these techniques are; (1) how does the soil around the root, the rhizosphere,
    function and influence the soil ecosystems at multiple scales, (2) what is the
    role of root-soil interface micro morphology and mycorrhizae on plant nutrient
    uptake, (3) what is the effect of plant exuded mucilage on the soil morphology,
    mechanics and resulting field and ecosystem scale soil function and (4) how to
    translate this knowledge from the single root scale to root system, field and
    ecosystem scale in order to predict how the climate change, different soil management
    strategies and plant breeding will influence the soil fertility.
