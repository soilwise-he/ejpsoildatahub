  title: 'Climate change and N2O emissions from South West England grasslands: A modelling
    approach'
  abstract: 'Agricultural soils are the dominant source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a
    potent greenhouse gas as well as a major cause of ozone layer depletion. Recent
    findings show that combinations of plants with complementary root traits can increase
    nitrogen (N) uptake leading to lower N2O emissions. Based on the microbiology
    behind soil N2O emissions and on plant-trait based ecology, this project aims
    to build on this finding and develop a novel N2O mitigation strategy. We aim to
    reveal how plants and plant interactions via their traits and trait combinations
    can be used to reduce N2O emissions in a context of climate change related disturbances
    (drought and intense rainfall). Starting with microcosm incubations using monocultures
    of different plant species, we will quantify the relative importance of specific
    plant traits as means to regulate N2O emissions. An ensemble of inter- and multi-disciplinary
    techniques will be applied to analyse the ecological and agronomical plant characteristics
    of potential relevance as well as the plant-specific microbiological communities
    of importance for the N-cycle. Subsequently, greenhouse mesocosm experiments will
    be used to expand the acquired knowledge to cover interactions between plants
    and stresses induced by climate change factors. A meta-analysis of published and
    unpublished datasets will allow further elucidation of specific and interactive
    mechanisms, differentiated by environmental and management factors and to include
    studies over longer time frames. Finally, the generated results will be used to
    calibrate and validate a process-based model in order to extrapolate our findings
    to regional levels. Deliverables will be peer-reviewed papers, new experimental
    data on a new N2O mitigation strategy, improved model tools to simulate mitigation
    and reports to policy makers and stake holders on a N2O mitigation strategy that
    concurrently maintains / increases agricultural production. Overall, ECONOMY will
    guide future N2O mitigation policy.
