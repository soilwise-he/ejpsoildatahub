  title: 'Fungal communities associated with almond throughout crop development: Implications
    for aflatoxin biocontrol management in California'
  abstract: "Aflatoxins (AF), the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds among the\
    \ mycotoxins, are mainly produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus.\
    \ Because these fungi are common soil residents of almond and pistachio orchards,\
    \ these nuts are one of the main sources of human exposure to AF. The consumption\
    \ of almond and pistachio has increased in recent years in the European Union\
    \ (EU) due to their positive effects on the consumers\u2019 health. Spain has\
    \ the largest area (587.000 ha) under almond cultivation after USA and its pistachio\
    \ growing-area is exponentially expanding. Contaminated batches of Spanish nuts\
    \ by AFs have been frequently detected. Application of atoxigenic strains of A.\
    \ flavus has successfully reduced crop AF-contamination in the USA and Africa.\
    \ This biological control strategy uses endemic atoxigenic A. flavus strains,\
    \ considered best adapted, to displace the AF-producing fungi. Unfortunately,\
    \ EU farmers do not have the benefit of this type of biological control technology\
    \ since there are not registered atoxigenic strains in this area. The aim of current\
    \ project is to; i) improve substrate and application methods of atoxigenic A.\
    \ flavus; ii) select new biological control agents for their patent and future\
    \ registration in EU and USA; and iii) construct mechanistic models of risk for\
    \ AF-contamination. The expected results will have a positive impact improving\
    \ food safety and the environment and securing economic benefits to EU farmers\
    \ and agri-food industries. In addition, this project supports capacity building,\
    \ provides the foundation to the fellow in pursuing his independent scientific\
    \ career and strengthens collaboration with research groups from EU and USA, three\
    \ small-medium enterprises (SEMs), and a spin-off company.\n"
