  title: Tracing the Biotransformation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Contaminated
    Soil Using Stable Isotope-Assisted Metabolomics
  abstract: 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are major soil pollutants causing
    special concern due to their high recalcitrance and (geno)toxicity. Despite the
    extensive knowledge gathered on microbial PAH degradation, current biorestoration
    technologies are still not sufficiently effective to decontaminate contaminated
    soils. One of the main characteristics that constrain PAH biodegradability in
    the environment is their low bioavailability for natural microbial communities,
    and the concomitant limited degradation rates. In addition, at PAH-polluted sites,
    other toxicologically relevant polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), such as oxygenated
    PAHs (oxy-PAHs) and nitrogen heterocyclic PAHs (N-PAHs), are generally present,
    their fate and, in the case of oxy-PAHs, formation being normally neglected. As
    a result, the success of bioremediation and its ecotoxicological assessment are
    often limited. NETPAC aims to identify the microbial communities and functions
    relevant for PAC biodegradation, and their adaptations to low bioavailability
    conditions, to further exploit them in novel and more sustainable approaches for
    biologically mediated restoration of PAH-impacted soils. Molecular microbial ecology
    and analytical chemistry methods in combination with stable isotope tracers will
    allow a systems biology insight into the complex microbial metabolic networks
    dealing with PAH-biodegradation and bioavailability in situ, by integrating genomics,
    transcriptomics and metabolomics data. Diagnostic tools will be developed and
    applied to monitor a lab-scale Green remediation approach based on enhanced natural
    attenuation, and to identify the natural microbial adaptations to promote the
    degradation of the expected low bioavailability residue. Understanding these processes
    will provide us with tools to assess biodegradation occurrence and, as a final
    outcome, predict the success of bioremediation thus reducing its uncertainties,
    one of the main drawbacks of this technology.
