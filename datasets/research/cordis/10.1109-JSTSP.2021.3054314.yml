  title: Tensor Decomposition Learning for Compression of Multidimensional Signals
  abstract: 'Earth Observation (EO) is undergoing a radical transformation due to
    the massive volume of observations acquired by remote sensing and in-situ sensor
    networks. While satellites provide coarse-resolution, yet global-scale monitoring
    of environmental processes, in-situ sensor networks acquire high-accuracy localized
    measurements. Extracting information from spaceborne and ground based instruments
    requires innovative solutions which will allow the autonomous integration of diverse
    in nature and scale observations in order to provide high-quality geophysical
    parameter estimation. CALCHAS will demonstrate cutting edge technologies targeting
    three major factors towards the vision of fully automated multi-source EO data
    understanding, namely (i) the fusion of observations from different sources and
    modalities, (ii) the efficient aggregation of the sampling scales associated with
    spaceborne and in-situ measurements, and (iii) the analysis of time-series of
    dynamic observations. To that end, the paradigm-shifting signal processing and
    learning framework of Deep Learning will be utilized and extended through powerful
    mathematical tools and appropriate methodologies like supervised and generative
    learning, dramatically extending the current scope of single source data analysis.
    The developed framework will be employed for analyzing time-series of measurements
    from active and passive microwave and multispectral spaceborne imaging instruments
    (SMAP, SMOS and Sentinels), and in-situ sensor measurements, targeting the high-accuracy
    spatial and temporal resolution enhancement for observations and soil moisture
    estimation. The merits of the developed technology will be demonstrated in two
    intelligent water management case studies, namely optimized irrigation management
    and water pipeline leakage detection.
