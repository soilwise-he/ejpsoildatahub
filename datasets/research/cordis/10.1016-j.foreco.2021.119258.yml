  title: Carbon allocation dynamics in conifers and broadleaved tree species revealed
    by pulse labeling and mass balance
  abstract: "Trees are unique in that responses at the organism level, being upscaled\
    \ to forest canopies, bear large effects on the cycling and distribution of water\
    \ and carbon in regional and global scales. Hence, tree carbon allocation dynamics\
    \ are central not only to tree eco-physiology but also to global biogeochemistry.\
    \ While tree aboveground carbon fluxes have been extensively studied, belowground\
    \ fluxes, such as root respiration, growth and exudation have been mostly overlooked\
    \ due to poor access to the root system. This project is set to address this knowledge\
    \ disparity by answering key questions concerning belowground carbon flow.In one\
    \ line of research, we will study the trees' \u201Cin-house\u201D management of\
    \ carbon flow, inspired by our recently achieved first comprehensive tree carbon\
    \ balance calculation, which indicates that carbon reserves serve as a buffer\
    \ that accommodates large fluctuations in carbon supply and demand. This will\
    \ be complemented by an exploration of the inter-tree carbon supply network of\
    \ mycorrhizal fungi routes, an investigation prompted by our discovery that mature\
    \ trees in a mixed forest transfer unprecedented amounts of carbon among each\
    \ other via fungal networks. Computational models will be applied to identify\
    \ the evolutionary requirements for the development of belowground carbon transfer\
    \ in a mycorrhizal network.We will dive into the highly complex soil system not\
    \ in an artificial medium system \u2013 but in a mixed forest site, complemented\
    \ by greenhouse experiments simulating forest tree communities. To trace below-ground\
    \ carbon transport, we will apply our novel methodology of continuous, in vivo,\
    \ combined measurement of 13CO2 carbon allocation and flux rate.This novel \u2018\
    rhizosphere expedition\u2019 will decipher the key belowground carbon transport\
    \ processes, shedding light on the extent to which trees and fungi regulate them\
    \ and facilitating predictions of carbon storage in changing climate and forests.\n"
