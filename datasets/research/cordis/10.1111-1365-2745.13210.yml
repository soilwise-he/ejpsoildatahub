  title: 'Evidence of functional species sorting by rainfall and biotic interactions:
    A community monolith experimental approach'
  abstract: "Gypsum soils occur worldwide and represent natural laboratories of evolution\
    \ and ecology. The unusual mineral content of gypsum soils is a significant barrier\
    \ to the growth of most plants, and yet these soils host highly diverse endemic\
    \ floras that have evolved independently on five continents. Nevertheless, these\
    \ ecosystems are poorly understood compared to those of other unusual substrates.\
    \ Little is known about the conservation status of gypsum floras, the potential\
    \ impact of climate change on them, and their responses to mitigation and restoration.\
    \ We propose an integrated global study of the ecology and evolution of plant\
    \ and lichen life on gypsum, including eight gypsum-rich regions from four continents\
    \ that differ in geological origin, climate, and flora. We will 1) assess the\
    \ plant and lichen diversity of gypsum; 2) investigate the evolutionary origins\
    \ and assembly of these floras; 3) evaluate potential adaptive mechanisms on gypsum,\
    \ the functional structure of gypsum plant and lichen communities, and the processes\
    \ regulating gypsum ecosystem function; 4) analyse the responses of gypsum communities\
    \ to global change drivers and explore how gypsum ecosystem restoration/conservation\
    \ may help mitigate the effects of global change; 5) promote the study of gypsum\
    \ ecosystems; and 6) communicate the ecological and conservation value of these\
    \ ecosystems to the public. With the involvement of gypsum experts from 18 academic\
    \ and non-academic organizations from 11 countries, this project provides an innovative,\
    \ integrative, and interdisciplinary approach to address key questions in gypsum\
    \ ecosystem ecology, evolution, and management. The project thus strengthens existing\
    \ international collaborative networks and consolidates Europe\u2019s leadership\
    \ in gypsum ecosystem research, including management and conservation plans and\
    \ the identification of traits for crop improvement on gypsum soils, enhancing\
    \ its attractiveness as a leading destination for related R&D\n"
