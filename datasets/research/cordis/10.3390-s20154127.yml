  title: Smart Multi-Sensor Platform for Analytics and Social Decision Support in
    Agriculture
  abstract: "SARMENTI develops a multisensor, low power IoT secure node to provide\
    \ decision support to farmers by monitoring in real-time and in situ soil nutrients\
    \ and gaseous emission. From this data measured on a daily basis over crop lifecycles,\
    \ the farmer will timely perform appropriate actions regarding fertilisation,\
    \ with direct impact on crop growth, soil & water quality and farmer income.The\
    \ SARMENTI system will embed electrochemical sensors to measure e.g. NOx, POx,\
    \ NH4, K, urea, pH, moisture, temperature. They will stay ideally during the crop\
    \ lifecycle in the soil with packaging issues to protect them from their environment.\
    \ A hygroscopic membrane will attract water from the soil, avoiding integration\
    \ of a power hungry active pump usually used to exact water from a soil sample.\
    \ SARMENTI will also monitor N2O (may appear in the nitrate cycle) and CH4 (generated\
    \ by decomposition of manure under anaerobic conditions) just above the ground.\
    \ These gases are greenhouse ones with higher warming potential than CO2.SARMENTI\
    \ is part of the IoT (e.g. LoRa, BLE connexion). Data integrity is guaranteed\
    \ by developing a secure node via combination of attack detection and automatic\
    \ countermeasures application.Partners bring SoA prototypes of electrochemical\
    \ and gas sensors and communication submodules, know-how in security for IoT nodes,\
    \ and expertise in Agriculture. SARMENTI will further improve the prototypes (power,\
    \ usage duration, hygroscopic membrane, packaging, sensitivity, selectivity) and\
    \ integrate them with advanced processing in a connected secured device. Cloud\
    \ Decisions support will allow evaluate the overall solution, SARMENTI demonstrator\
    \ being tested in real fields.SARMENTI directly addresses ICT-7 challenge; \u201C\
    develop and validate new generation of cost-effective ESS ...\u201D, RIA aim;\
    \ \u201Cdemonstrate ESS bringing intelligence ... integration of sensor systems,\
