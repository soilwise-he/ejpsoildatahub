  title: Root anatomy and soil resource capture
  abstract: 'Plant-associated microorganisms influence plant growth by means of the
    transformation of nutrients in the root-soil interphase. Nitrogen fertilization
    is a primary economic and environmental component of intensive maize production.
    Root phenotypes show a remarkable yet scarcely explored diversity at the architectural
    and anatomical levels of organization. Such natural variation in root phenotypes
    has been hypothesized to be related to adaptation under edaphic nutrient stress.
    The rhizosphere and rhizoplane microenvironments are microbial hotspots that may
    be influenced by the root phenotype. Contrasting phenotypes may have differences
    in root exudate localization and oxygen availability, two factors that have important
    effects on the composition and function of rhizosphere bacteria. In the context
    of the plant microbiome, previous studies have found effects of planting site,
    soil properties, compartmentalization (bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, endosphere),
    agricultural management, and fertilization regimes on root-associated microbial
    communities of agriculturally relevant plants. However, the root phenotype has
    yet not been evaluated as possible source of variation for the plant-associated
    microbiome and to link this information with nutrient uptake efficiency. This
    proposal aims at filling this gap by combining state-of-art root phenotyping,
    deep molecular genetic assessment of the microbiome, and 15N stable isotope tracing
    to assess the influence of maize root phenotypes on the root-associated microbiome
    and its combined effect on fertilizer nitrogen uptake efficiency under low nitrogen
    availability. Such information will be useful to inform future plant breeding
    programs targeting root phenes and microbiomes and reduce the reliance on agrochemicals
    in the context of sustainable agriculture.
