  title: The RESEARCH project. Soil-related hazards and archaeological heritage in
    the challenge of climate change
  abstract: "Europe has rich and diverse cultural heritage resources, which include\
    \ urban and rural landscapes, comprising standing monuments and archaeological\
    \ remains. Nowadays Europe\u2019s Cultural Heritage (CH) is at risk, endangered\
    \ by environmental processes and anthropogenic pressures. Physical and chemical\
    \ destruction and degradation of structures and artefacts amplify the natural\
    \ deterioration and reduce the ability of the soil to preserve CH. In addition\
    \ to physical damages, the intensive human activities and the effects of climate\
    \ changes are responsible of the increase of soil erosion affecting structure\
    \ stability and producing significant negative consequences on the conservation\
    \ of the archaeological artefacts. In this scenario, authorities in charge to\
    \ CH preservation have a strong requirement for systematic, effective, usable\
    \ and affordable tools and services to monitor the degradation process to enable\
    \ preventive maintenance and to reduce the cost of the restoration. The broad\
    \ spectra of Satellite Earth Observations (EO) provide the ideal platform to undertake\
    \ a wide range of effective, cost-efficient and up-to-date programmable analysis,\
    \ as a support to traditional tools. RESEARCH addresses the design and development\
    \ of a multi-task platform, combining advanced remote sensing technologies with\
    \ GIS application for mapping and long term monitoring of archaeological CH in\
    \ order to identify changes due to climate changes and anthropic pressures. The\
    \ EO processing chain will address the major risks affecting CH including the\
    \ degradation due to soil erosion, land movement and vegetation as well as risks\
    \ due to anthropic pressure. RESEARCH will coordinate the existing expertise and\
    \ research efforts of seven beneficiaries into a synergetic plan of collaborations\
    \ and exchanges of personnel to offer a comprehensive transfer of knowledge and\
    \ training environment for the researchers in the specific area.\n"
