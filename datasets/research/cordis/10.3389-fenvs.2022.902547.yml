  title: 'Editorial: Terrestrial Ecosystem Nitrogen Fluxes via the Atmosphere-Land
    System'
  abstract: "Ecosystems located in the Mediterranean Basin are projected to experience\
    \ important changes in the rainfall dynamics and to increase its nitrogen (N)\
    \ inputs as a result of the ongoing global change. Despite it is known that multiple\
    \ environmental changes can interact in their impacts on ecosystem services producing\
    \ non-additive effects that are unpredictable from single-factor studies, no research\
    \ has been performed to disentangle the effects of the interactive global change\
    \ drivers on soil processes in Mediterranean ecosystems to date. What are the\
    \ synergistic effects of climate change and N inputs on soil processes in Mediterranean\
    \ ecosystems? What is the role of the soil biological crust and its components\
    \ in modulating resistance and resilience of soil processes to the synergistic\
    \ effects of increased N and climate change? How ecosystem services are influenced?\
    \ Answering those questions will have highly relevant implications on environmental\
    \ policy and prediction of global change scenarios, with the ultimate societal\
    \ objective of improving ecosystem management in Mediterranean ecosystems. Med-N-Change\
    \ also has a clear potential on the economy since recovering damaged ecosystems\
    \ services is much costlier than increasing their resilience to pressure. The\
    \ strength of Med-N-Change lies in an innovative approach that couples microcosm\
    \ manipulative experiments and the exploitation of a network of long-term N-addition\
    \ experiments in three ecosystems across the Mediterranean basin. This project\
    \ merges together well established research methods and elements of originality\
    \ in a multidisciplinary approach combining ecology, biogeochemical processes,\
    \ physiology and omics technology. Med-N-Change directly addresses two of the\
    \ cross-cutting priorities established by the H2020 Work Programme \u2013 sustainable\
    \ development and climate action \u2013 and thus reinforces the European competitiveness\
    \ in N deposition and climate change research.\n"
