  title: Scoping the potential usefulness of seasonal climate forecasts for solar
    power management
  abstract: "The modelling community achieved steady progress in dynamical climate\
    \ prediction using Earth System models and the last decade has seen an accelerated\
    \ development for the land surface component. This has led to predictions that\
    \ are now considered useful for some societal applications over \u201Chot-spot\u201D\
    \ land areas such as the Euro-Mediterranean. However, forecasts performance over\
    \ land is still substantially weaker compared with ocean, due to the lack of observations,\
    \ which has hampered the development of well-constrained land processes models.\
    \ While benefiting from daily verification, the models used for the prediction\
    \ of the short time-scales (from weather to seasons) include only that part of\
    \ the surface variability for which observations are available and that can be\
    \ modeled/initialized to positively contribute to the forecasts (verification-based\
    \ approach). As a consequence, they unavoidably lack some processes such as those\
    \ related to ecosystems and their variability. On the other hand, longer time-scales\
    \ (interannual to centennial) models used for climate variability/change research\
    \ contain comprehensive vegetation and soil schemes intended to represent as many\
    \ processes as possible, even those that are still poorly constrained or understood.\
    \ Through the synergy between process-based and verification-based approaches\
    \ the ambitious objective of this project is to obtain a practicable seamless\
    \ development across scales of the land modelling applied to Earth System predictions.\
    \ The main goal will be to obtain verifiable land processes models to enhance\
    \ the performance of the predictions across scales and to demonstrate unprecedented\
    \ useful applications for the energy sector. A fundamental contribution to fill\
    \ in the gap between short- and long-term Earth System predictions will come from\
    \ the emerging availability of reliable land surface observations from remotely\
    \ sensed satellite campaigns that will provide novel observational constraints\
    \ to land processes models.\n"
