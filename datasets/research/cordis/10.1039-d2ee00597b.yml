  title: 'A plant-like battery: a biodegradable power source ecodesigned for precision
    agriculture'
  abstract: "Wireless electronic systems (nodes) used in precision agriculture (PA)\
    \ can bring solutions to a grand challenge that Europe is facing; producing more/better\
    \ food despite shrinking agricultural zones while also limiting pollution by reducing\
    \ the amount of agrochemicals used. Nevertheless, severe constraints apply to\
    \ conventional nodes that must be deployed in vast agricultural fields; i) they\
    \ are powered by batteries that must be replaced or recharged; ii) they cannot\
    \ be left in the soil because of the toxic metals/materials they intrinsically\
    \ contain. With the aim to set new standards for nodes used in PA, the GREAT-4PA\
    \ project proposes to redefine completely the core electronic components of game-changing\
    \ nodes having unique and unprecedented attributes. Specifically, this proposal\
    \ focuses on developing green autonomous nodes; namely self-powered biodegradable/compostable\
    \ nodes having the ability to physically disappear after a period of stable operation\
    \ so they could be left in the soil after use with zero environmental impact.\
    \ Further, the GREAT-4PA project proposes to go beyond the usual sensing capabilities\
    \ of nodes by adding actuation functionalities to create green smart transducers\
    \ which could deliver agrochemicals locally (e.g., near the plant roots). The\
    \ project involves two of the most prominent figures in the field of paper-based\
    \ microfluidic fuel cells and biodegradable batteries (Dr. Neus Sabat\xE9 and\
    \ Dr. Juan Pablo Esquivel, IMBCNM-CSIC, Spain). To maximise the outcomes and potential\
    \ impact of the proposed research, two additional actions are planned; i) a partnership\
    \ with the Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA); ii) a secondment within Fuelium,\
    \ a Spanish company specialised in the development and commercialization of paper-based\
    \ batteries. The completion of such a multidisciplinary project could open up\
    \ research avenues. It will also lay the foundation for long-term collaborative\
    \ efforts with partner organisations in academia and industry.\n"
