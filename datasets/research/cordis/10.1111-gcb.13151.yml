  title: Canopy leaf area of a mature evergreen Eucalyptus woodland does not respond
    to elevated atmospheric [CO 2 ] but tracks water availability
  abstract: "Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, increasing temperature and altered\
    \ precipitation patterns dramatically impact the terrestrial biosphere with important\
    \ consequences for all biogeochemical cycles. Predictions of carbon (C) and water\
    \ exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere require detailed mechanistic\
    \ understanding of how plants control water loss and C gain through their stomatal\
    \ pores. Currently, global circulation models incorporate formulations of stomatal\
    \ conductance (gs) based on stomatal optimisation theory. However, these models\
    \ ignore gs regulation; (1) during night time, despite clear evidence for significant\
    \ nocturnal transpiration, (2) in non-vascular plants and (3) during leaf development\
    \ and senescence. To reduce the uncertainty associated with current C and water\
    \ fluxes in models, we need to incorporate robust predictions of gs in response\
    \ to novel environmental conditions (higher temperature, decreased water availability\
    \ and elevated CO2). To fill these gaps, USIFlux, will develop a novel tracing\
    \ technique to measure gs during the dark, when fluxes are an order of magnitude\
    \ smaller than during the day. To do so, we will combine measurements of COS (carbonyl\
    \ sulphide) uptake with CO18O fluxes and changes in the oxygen isotope composition\
    \ (\u03B418O) of water in leaves. We will relate the response of gs at night to\
    \ changes in gs during the day and in response to drought and elevated CO2. These\
    \ measurements will be coupled to an experiment to investigate stomatal regulation\
    \ during leaf ontogeny and in different life forms. Here, we will challenge the\
    \ stomatal optimisation theory in life forms lacking active stomatal control (mosses\
    \ and brackens) and during leaf development, when leaf construction costs constrain\
    \ the optimisation of C gain. Empirical formulations arising from these experiments\
    \ will be incorporated into large-scale soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models\
    \ to explore their impact at larger scales.\n"
