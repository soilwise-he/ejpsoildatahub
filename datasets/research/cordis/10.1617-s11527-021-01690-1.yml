  title: Self-healing of bio-cementitious mortar incubated within neutral and acidic
    soil
  abstract: 'Concrete is the most used construction material worldwide for infrastructure
    projects. Due to deterioration, regular maintenance works are necessary to seal
    the concrete cracks and restore durability. In Europe, infrastructures such as
    tunnels and earth retaining walls alone cost approximately 5 billion EUR per year.
    Self-healing strategies (particularly bacterial-based self-healing) are regarded
    as a promising solution to reduce the high maintenance and repair cost of concrete
    infrastructures. It is believed if self-healing concrete had been used for all
    these structures, up to 120 million EUR could be saved annually on their maintenance.
    The research to date has tended to focus on the self-healing process in air or
    water environment. However, infrastructures (i.e. bridges, buildings, tunnels)
    are built on or in the ground, where part of their concrete structures are inevitably
    embedded in soil environment with all sorts of ground conditions such as different
    types of soil, saturation regimes, and chemical exposures. It is not clear if
    the process of self-healing is efficient within concrete elements exposed to such
    complicated ground conditions. The project aims to explore the efficiency of the
    bacterial-based self-healing (bio-hydrogels) in underground concrete structures.
    By using a novel interdisciplinary approach, the research combines state-of-the-art
    technologies applied in materials/concrete, geotechnical engineering, and microbiology
    to conduct a series of lab-scale experiments on mortar specimens incubated within
    various soil environments. Purpose-built experimental tools are used to investigate
    the effect of several factors including the type of soil, saturation regime and
    class of (chemical) exposures, on the bio-self-healing process. The outcomes of
    this research are highly relevant to the construction industry and the knowledge
    produced by the project will have an economic, financial and societal impact in
    EU and other regions.
