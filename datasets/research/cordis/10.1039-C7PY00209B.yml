  abstract: "Food production is predicated on the application of nitrogen fertilisers,\
    \ which can contribute significantly to the production of greenhouse gasses and\
    \ eutrophication of agroecosystems. The use of nitrogen fertilisers must, therefore,\
    \ be optimised.The recent development of transparent soils in my group gives great\
    \ scope to unravel the processes involved in the reactive transport of nutrients\
    \ in soil and their interaction with the soil biota. My team will combine principles\
    \ of optics, chemical engineering, the physics, chemistry, and biology of soils,\
    \ and plant biology to image and characterise nitrogen movement in soil at the\
    \ micro-scale. We will develop a new generation of transparent soil analogues\
    \ that measure the biological and chemical status of soils. This will enable,\
    \ for the first time, to characterise transport at the surface of soil particles\
    \ and to elucidate the role of root\u2013particle\u2013particle contacts, exudation\
    \ and microbial transformation on the bioavailability of nitrate and ammonium.\
    \ The legacy of the research will be knowledge, concepts, model soil systems and\
    \ imaging approaches to understand and predict nutrient bioavailability in soil\
    \ with an emphasis on nitrification as a model for nitrogen movement in soil.\
    \ Transparent soils and imaging technologies will be patented and could pave the\
    \ way for 3D chemical sensors, and have application in crop breeding and precision\
    \ phenotyping. Understanding of nutrient movements in soil will lead to substantial\
    \ progress in the development of more efficient fertilisers. New model soil systems\
    \ could be used to better understand the spread of soil-borne diseases, the bio-remediation\
    \ of contaminated soils and the mechanisms underlying soil biodiversity and activity.\n"
