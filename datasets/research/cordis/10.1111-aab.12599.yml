  title: Coexistent Mediterranean woody species as a driving factor of Phytophthora
    cinnamomi infectivity and survival
  abstract: 'Global change is a complex phenomenon that involves several factors such
    as climate change, the alteration of the nitrogen cycle, biological invasions
    or changes in land use. Although each of these factors has been individually studied
    in detail in the last years, it is still poorly known how they could interact
    to affect biotic communities and the ecosystem processes that they control. The
    general objective of this proposal is to advance in the understanding of the direct
    and indirect effects of climate change on biotic communities and invasive pathogens
    interactions in forest systems. This interaction has been largely ignored so far,
    but its consideration is crucial to understand how abiotic and biotic stress factors
    together determine forest health and stability. Specifically, CCPaMe aims to;
    1) Determine the direct effects of climate change on the exotic pathogen Phytophthora
    cinnamomi. It will be identified potential non-additive effects of rainfall exclusion
    and warming on its abundance and infected capacity by field and growth chamber
    experiments. 2) Determine the indirect effects of climate change on soil microorganisms
    and P. cinnamomi ecology. It will be determined the effects of climate change
    on the hosts susceptibility to P. cinnamomi and on the abundance, diversity and
    composition of soil organisms community (bacteria, fungi, archaea and actinomycete)
    and their implications for P. cinnamomi functionality; modification of its infective
    capacity and the alteration of pathogen interactions with other soil microbes.
    CCPaMe results will provide key insights to address current challenges regarding
    climate change effects and exotic pathogen control on forest systems and the conservation
    and protection of forest resources. Moreover, they will allow an improvement of
    our predictive capacity of the socio-economic consequences of future P. cinnamomi
    outbreaks, serving as a guide for the design of up-to-date management and mitigation
    policies.
