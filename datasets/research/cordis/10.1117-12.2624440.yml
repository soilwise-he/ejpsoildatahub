  title: Perfluorinated polymer fibre Bragg grating sensors for distributed low-dose
    clinical X-ray measurements
  abstract: 'The POSPORI project is dedicated to accelerating the deployment and use
    of polymer optical fibre Bragg grating (POFBG) sensing technology for prolonged
    overseeing the robustness of civil infrastructures. The two key research objectives
    are to develop optical fibre sensing systems to assess the stability of (i) reinforced
    concrete and (ii) reinforced soil structures, which are the key elements for safe
    construction in civil engineering. The project seeks to take a significant step
    beyond the current technology readiness level and enhance the creative and innovative
    potential of experienced researcher (Andreas Pospori) in the field of optical
    fibre sensors.
