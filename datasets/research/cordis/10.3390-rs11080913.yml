  title: 'Multispectral Contrast of Archaeological Features: A Quantitative Evaluation'
  abstract: "Ancient roads cross-culturally reflect motivations and needs behind social,\
    \ economic, political and religious relations of past societies; they imposed\
    \ spatial order on agricultural production, enabled transportation of bulk-goods,\
    \ mediated hegemonic power, and facilitated urban fabric. Everyday actions of\
    \ past individuals must have had contributed to the formation of roads. And, in\
    \ return roads must have had sustained individual (and societal) connectivity.\
    \ Therefore, considered not only as the container of action, but also the action\
    \ itself, the road has much more to say on the ancient movement praxis.  GeoMOP\
    \ investigates Early Bronze Age roads (also called hollow ways) in Upper Mesopotamia.\
    \ At this space-time continuum, the movement praxis of the political economy contributed\
    \ to the formation of roads. In realization of this, GeoMOP will construct an\
    \ exceptionally detailed typology of hollow ways. The methodology axiomatizes\
    \ that variations in the volumes of ancient movement resulted in quantifiable\
    \ differences in soil compaction which in return variably changed soil composition\
    \ and structure. GeoMOP will explore these differences via satellite remote sensing\
    \ under the sensor fusion paradigm. In following, an Agent Based Model will be\
    \ constructed to estimate numbers of moving agents (e.g. herd animals and wheeled\
    \ carts).Results of the study will far surpass the current archaeological knowledge\
    \ on locations and dimensions of hollow ways \u2014the container, and will build\
    \ an analytical model for the ancient traffic \u2014the action. In return, movement\
    \ praxis will provide details of EBA political economy; including land ownership,\
    \ urban-rural relationships, and nodes of economic complexity. In particular,\
    \ GeoMOP will investigate questions, such as; if the spatial configuration and\
    \ use intensity of roads can describe variations in economies and reflect conflicting\
    \ economic interests of different social groups.\n"
