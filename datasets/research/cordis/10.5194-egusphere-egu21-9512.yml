  abstract: "The main objective of EJP SOIL is to create an enabling environment to\
    \ enhance the contribution of agricultural soils to key societal challenges such\
    \ as climate change adaptation and mitigation, sustainable agricultural production,\
    \ ecosystem services provision and prevention and restoration of land and soil\
    \ degradation.The EJP SOIL will build a sustainable European integrated research\
    \ community on agricultural soils and will develop and deploy a roadmap on climate-smart\
    \ sustainable agricultural soil management.The EJP SOIL roadmap is based on a\
    \ knowledge framework with 4 interacting components. Knowledge development is\
    \ set out in project calls with internal and external partners. Knowledge sharing\
    \ & transfer is framed in capacity building for young scientists, enhancing general\
    \ public awareness and fostering societal understanding and appreciation of agricultural\
    \ soil management and its contribution to society. Knowledge harmonization, storage\
    \ & organization supports harmonised soil information and reporting practices.\
    \ Knowledge application deals with ways to overcome barriers for adoption of novel\
    \ practices in a European context, co-developing adequate tools and providing\
    \ evidence-based recommendations for EU policies.EJP SOIL activities in interaction\
    \ with stakeholders, MSs and DG AGRI will pursue the long-term goal of promoting\
    \ farmers as stewards of land and soil resources and support policy development\
    \ and deployment, in particular the CAP and Climate policies. The EJP SOIL addresses\
    \ 6 expected impacts with targeted activities in response to societal, scientific,\
    \ policy and operational challenges. A first annual workplan based on the roadmap\
    \ is provided as part of the proposal.The EJP Soil consortium unites a unique\
    \ group of 26 leading European research institutes and universities in 24 countries.\
    \ The consortium has developed this proposal in close collaboration with its programme\
    \ owners and has secured over 40M\u20AC in co-funding and 10M\u20AC for external\
    \ calls over 5 years.\n"
