  title: Multi-omics and potential applications in wine production
  abstract: "A diverse, complex, and poorly characterised community of microorganisms\
    \ lies at the heart of the wine \u2013 an industry worth over \u20AC220 billion\
    \ globally. These microorganisms play key roles at all stages of the viniculture\
    \ and vinification processes, from helping plants access nutrients from the soil,\
    \ driving their health through protection against pathogens, to fermentation processes\
    \ that transform the must into wine with its complex array of aromas and flavours.\
    \ Given this importance, an improved understanding of the microbial community\
    \ and its interplay will have significant effects on the industry. In recent years,\
    \ 'Next Generation' DNA sequencing has revolutionised many areas of biology, including\
    \ microbiology, through conferring the ability to characterise microbes on the\
    \ deep community scale, through both \u2019shotgun\u2019 and \u2019deep amplicon\u2019\
    \ sequencing approaches. To exploit this power for the benefit of the wine industry,\
    \ we propose MICROWINE, a 15 ESR Marie Curie Actions European Training Network.\
    \ The network is constructed as a close collaboration between industry and academic\
    \ partners, around the theme of the microbial community\u2019s role in the wine\
    \ production process. Through combining microbial metagenomic sequencing with\
    \ powerful computation analyses, with metadata generated using techniques such\
    \ as metabolomics and geochemistry, we will study the action of microbes from\
    \ the plant protection and nutrition, through to wine fermentation process, using\
    \ samples collected from both Europe and beyond. We will further train the ESRs\
    \ across a wide range of relevant disciplines, and maximise information transfer\
    \ through multiple host and academic-industry cosupervision and secondments. In\
    \ this way, we anticipate contributing to the strength and scientific progress\
    \ of the wine industry through training of a cohort of leading, interdisciplinary\
    \ and tightly interconnected scientists at the forefront of modern microbiological,\
    \ genomic, computational and related techniques.\n"
