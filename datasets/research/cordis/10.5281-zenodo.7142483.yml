  title: Co-culture of human type I and type II pneumocyte cell lines as a model of
    alveolar epithelium
  abstract: 'The main goal of PlasticsFatE (Plastics Fate and Effects in the Human
    Body) is to improve our present understanding of the impact of micro- and nano-plastics
    (MP/NP) and associated additives/adsorbed contaminants (A/C) in the human body.
    Human exposure to MP/NP may result from the widespread use of plastic products
    and their release to the environment, where they degrade to MP/NP particles. But
    plastics particles reach natural systems also as secondary by-products, e.g.,
    from tyre wear or abrasion of textiles. As a consequence, these particles are
    found in food, drinking water, air and environmental media (food chain, soils).
    Despite recent efforts to assess the real dimension of human risks associated
    with MP/NP, our current knowledge is still insufficient. One of the reasons is
    the lack of reliable and validated methods that are able to generate the science-based
    data we need. PlasticsFatE will address this challenge and associated uncertainties
    by implementing a comprehensive measurement and testing program (test the test),
    including inter-laboratory studies, to improve and validate the performance and
    applicability of available methods and tools to MP/NP. The tested and validated
    approaches will be used to (1) identify and detect MP/NP and A/C in a variety
    of complex matrices, such as food (vegetables, fruits, beverages, fish etc.),
    human tissues and consumer products (tooth paste, beauty products), as well as
    relevant environmental media (air, drinking water, soils), and to (2) assess their
    (also long-term) fate and toxicity in the human body by using advanced cell culture
    and organ models that simulate real exposure to MP/NP in the respiratory and gastro-intestinal
    tract. The newly developed innovative approaches will be integrated into a novel
    risk assessment strategy specifically designed for MP/NP to provide the policy
    relevant and scientifically sound data needed to support the health-relevant aims
    of European strategies for plastics. PlasticsFatE is part of the European MNP
    cluster on human health.
