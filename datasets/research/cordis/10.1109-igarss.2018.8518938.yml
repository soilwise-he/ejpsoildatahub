    Towards Operational Mapping'
  abstract: "In the emerging Copernicus Earth monitoring era, Europe provides Earth\
    \ Observation (EO) data from Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) on a free and\
    \ open data policy basis. In response of the EO Work programme \u2018EO-3-2016;\
    \ Evaluation of Copernicus Services\u2019, Sentinels Synergy for Agriculture (SENSAGRI)\
    \ aims to exploit the unprecedented capacity of S1 and S2 to develop an innovative\
    \ portfolio of prototypes agricultural monitoring services. When used alone either\
    \ optical or radar sensors allow the mapping of crop types. However more robust,\
    \ accurate, frequently updated and comprehensive crop maps are expected from the\
    \ seldom exploited synergy of both types of measurements. The same holds when\
    \ dealing with crop status, health and stresses. Experimental studies have demonstrated\
    \ that fusion of optical and radar data opens up prospects for enhanced monitoring\
    \ capabilities. SENSAGRI will exploit the synergy of optical and radar measurements\
    \ to develop three prototype services capable of near real time operations; (1)\
    \ surface soil moisture (SSM), (2) green and brown leaf area index (LAI) and (3)\
    \ crop type mapping. These prototypes shall provide a baseline for advanced services\
    \ that can boost the competitiveness of the European agro-industrial sector. SENSAGRI\
    \ proposes four advanced proof-of-concept services; (i) yield/biomass, (ii) tillage\
    \ change, (iii) irrigation and (iv) advanced crop maps. The algorithms will be\
    \ developed and validated in four European agricultural test areas in Spain, France,\
    \ Italy and Poland, which are representative of the European crop diversity, and\
    \ their usefulness demonstrated in at least two non-European countries. In order\
    \ to refine the specifications of the products and to iteratively assess the services,\
    \ actors of the agricultural sector will be involved using a Living Lab approach.\
    \ The combination of user-centered approach and of state-of-the-art algorithms\
    \ will establish a sound foundation for deciding of a new Copernicus land service.\n"
