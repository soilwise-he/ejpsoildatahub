  title: "Time-lapse monitoring of root water uptake using electrical resistivity\
    \ tomography and mise-\xE0-la-masse: a vineyard infiltration experiment"
  abstract: "GROWING is a project dealing with the use of minimally invasive methods\
    \ for roots monitoring, with the specific aim of improving water use in arboriculture,\
    \ viticulture and agronomy.  The aim of GROWING is to develop our capability of\
    \ understanding, through measuring and modeling, the actions of the root system\
    \ on water state and fluxes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This is particularly\
    \ critical in areas of water scarcity, such as the Mediterranean region. GROWING\
    \ is based upon three scientific pillars; (a) an advanced plant root phenotyping\
    \ technology using geophysical methods, overcoming current limitation in imaging\
    \ roots under field working conditions; (b) a coupled above and below-ground monitoring\
    \ using geophysical, plant physiology and atmospheric measurements and (c) a data\
    \ assimilation scheme that uses the data above to construct a hydrogeophysical\
    \ model of water distribution in soil and exchanges with the atmosphere.The scientific\
    \ developments above will then foster the design of new tools and services for\
    \ arboriculture, viticulture and agronomy with the ambition to transfer innovative\
    \ knowledge to stakeholders, farmers, and winemakers in particular. The ground\
    \ breaking nature of GROWING lies in the pooling of human, technical, and data\
    \ resources, in order to better understand the hydric stress and roots response\
    \ under a range of soil and agricultural practices.In order to warrant effective\
    \ dissemination of the project\u2019s results, I will work both with academic\
    \ partners, the university in Padua (UNIPD) and the Lawrence Berkeley National\
    \ Lab (LBNL) during the outgoing phase, and with farmers and stakeholders thanks\
    \ to private companies\u2019 collaboration (FruitionSciences, Noble research institute).\
    \ A two- way knowledge transfer is expected, with novel practical solutions to\
    \ be developed in order to make non-invasive geophysical methods a state-of-the-art\
    \ practice particularly in high-value crops.\n"
