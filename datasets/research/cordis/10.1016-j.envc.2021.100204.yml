  title: Studying temporal variations of indoor radon as a vital step towards rational
    and harmonized international regulation
  abstract: 'Radon is an important carcinogenic factor causing lung cancer. To reduce
    this risk legislators limit the annual average indoor radon (AAIR) concentration
    in buildings. However, the reliable assessment of AAIR is a problem, because indoor
    radon has significant temporal (daily, weekly and seasonal) variations. Despite
    the AAIR is tested in many countries for several decades, none of national regulations
    (the measurement protocol in USA, ISO and IAEA recommendations), provide an assessment
    of the AAIR uncertainty depending on the test duration. This allows neither optimizing
    the test duration, nor correct comparing the AAIR with reference levels. Thus,
    the main goal of the project is the assessment of the AAIR uncertainty based on
    the results of measurements with different duration and the development of reliable
    criteria for comparing the AAIR and reference levels. To accomplish this goal
    we propose to make; (a) preliminary short-term measurements in at least 180 buildings
    in Haifa to identify at least 12 experimental rooms with a high radon level, (b)
    complete annual radon monitoring in these rooms, also measuring the concentration
    of soil radon and its flow under single building. Based on the original algorithm
    to process monitoring data, the radon temporal variation coefficient values (depending
    on the measurement duration) will be obtained and verified. This coefficient is
    the main source of AAIR uncertainty. In addition, the degree of influence of environmental
    factors on indoor radon behavior (correction factor) will be determined. Using
    the correction factor can significantly reduce the AAIR uncertainty. The results
    of this study will help to; (a) apply in practice the principle of AAIR control
    firstly proposed by us, (b) revise the international standard (ISO), (c) develop
    a strategy to identify buildings with high radon, (d) assess the exposure doses
    from radon and create a map of radon hazard zones in Haifa (IL), (e) develop the
    career of the researcher.
