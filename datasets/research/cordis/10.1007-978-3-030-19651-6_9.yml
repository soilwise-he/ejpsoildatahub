  title: Precise Positioning and Heading for Autonomous Scouting Robots in a Harsh
    Environment
  abstract: "European agriculture is facing numerous challenges such as population\
    \ growth, climate change, resource shortages or increased competition. Besides,\
    \ the area of land available for agriculture is declining, rural areas become\
    \ depopulated and farming population is aging. Today\u2019s challenge is to produce\
    \ \u201Cmore with less\u201D.Greenhouses protect crops from adverse weather conditions\
    \ allowing year-round production. Integrated crop management approaches provide\
    \ better control over pests and diseases. However, the intensification of greenhouse\
    \ crop production creates favorable conditions for devastating infestation that\
    \ can cost a 25% of the potential income. Greenhouse crop production is growing\
    \ throughout the world, generating 46,377\u20AC/ha across Europe.GreenPatrol aims\
    \ at developing an innovative and efficient robotic solution for Integrated Pest\
    \ Management in crops, which has the ability to navigate inside greenhouses while\
    \ performing early pest detection and control tasks in an autonomous way.  Main\
    \ developments will be focused on;- Precise positioning to provide accurate and\
    \ detailed pest maps in greenhouses (light indoor environments)- Perception with\
    \ visual sensing for on-line pest detection, including reasoning mechanisms for\
    \ efficient action selection- Strategies for manipulation and motion planning\
    \ based on pest monitoring feedback.Galileo capabilities are considered a fundamental\
    \ technology for the proposed solution as it provides better performance against\
    \ the multipath and signal degradation present in greenhouses.GreenPatrol will\
    \ achieve a remarkable reduction of production losses and chemicals usage, as\
    \ well as an increase in quality and competitiveness, leading to more sustainable\
    \ farming and enhanced food safety and soil and water protection.The project includes\
    \ a validation stage where the prototype will be tested in real environment to\
    \ reach TRL7. GreenPatrol will be commercially exploited. Its business plan shows\
    \ profits starting in year 3.\n"
