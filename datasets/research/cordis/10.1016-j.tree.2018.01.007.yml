  title: Towards the Integration of Niche and Network Theories
  abstract: 'Current rates of biodiversity loss threaten the delivery of a range ecosystem
    services critical to human welfare. To maintain ecosystem multifunctionality there
    is a broad consensus that biodiversity must be conserved or restored, but a key
    aspect of this, which is still poorly recognized, is that ecosystem services can
    only persist over space and time if ecological communities are stable (i.e. species
    within communities do not go locally extinct). However, the mechanistic connections
    between the maintenance of species diversity and the stability of multiple ecosystem
    functions have yet to be established. Such ecological knowledge is basic to understanding
    the social and economic benefits of management actions on biodiversity. BioFUNC
    aims to investigate the effects of the mechanisms maintaining species diversity
    (niche and fitness differences) on the stability of multiple ecosystem functions.
    To accomplish this we aim to take a multidisciplinary approach by combining recent
    advances in ecological theory with plant population models and observational and
    field experiments, along with structural equation modelling and meta-analytical
    techniques. Two lines of related research will be pursued; 1) an investigation
    of the effects of species traits on species coexistence in spatially and temporally
    variable environments, and 2) an investigation of the effects of species coexistence
    mechanisms on the stability of ecosystem functioning in space and time. BioFUNC
    is a collaborative project between IRNAS-CSIC (Spain, beneficiary) and IPS-University
    of Bern (Switzerland, partner), which foresees three key results. First, developing
    a toolbox for predicting when ecosystems services are transient or stable. Second,
    disentangling direct and indirect effects of climate, soil and species traits
    on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Third, predicting the sign and magnitude
    of a change in multiple ecosystem functions due to the loss of diversity or changes
    in species composition
