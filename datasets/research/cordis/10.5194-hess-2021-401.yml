  abstract: "Science-based, sustainable management is needed to preserve the diverse\
    \ and essential services provided by freshwaters. In natural and semi-natural\
    \ areas, up to 90% of the total river length is in headwaters (i.e. small streams).\
    \ Water quality in these \u201Clungs of the landscape\u201D is controlled primarily\
    \ by soils adjacent to streams, i.e. riparian zones (RZs). Within RZs, the dominant\
    \ source layer (DSL), a localized hotspot, contributes most of the solute and\
    \ water fluxes to streams. However, the relative importance of DSL hydrological\
    \ and biogeochemical processes controlling freshwater quality varies across ecoregions.\
    \ The overall aim of RIPARIONS is to develop a unified knowledge framework based\
    \ on DSL hydrological and biogeochemical functions across Europe to predict material\
    \ transfer from soils to surface waters and consequent effects on water quality.\
    \ Specifically, RIPARIONS will extend the DSL conceptual model developed in the\
    \ boreal ecoregion by testing its applicability in two contrasting (sub-humid\
    \ and a semi-arid) Mediterranean catchments. First, DSLs will be identified via\
    \ hydrological site characterization using digital elevation models and on-site\
    \ measurements. Biogeochemical investigations will link DSL processes and stream\
    \ solute processing to assess stream water quality. Modelling of climate change\
    \ impacts on DSL position and subsequent effects on future water quality will\
    \ be assessed. Finally, a synthesis and integration of this work with previous\
    \ and ongoing work in boreal and temperate sites will create a unified framework\
    \ predicting RZ function and water quality across European ecoregions based on\
    \ the DSL concept. While the Water Framework Directive mandates protection of\
    \ RZs to maintain ecological status of rivers, it does not state how to manage\
    \ them. RIPARIONS will fill this gap by identifying hotspots of water movement/processing\
    \ within RZs (i.e. DSLs) that are the most influential for freshwater chemistry,\
    \ and thus the most in need of protection\n"
