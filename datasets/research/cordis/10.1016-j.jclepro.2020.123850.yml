  title: Waste derived biochar as an alternative filler in biocomposites - Mechanical,
    thermal and morphological properties of biochar added biocomposites
  abstract: "The Organic-PLUS project has the overall aim of providing high quality,\
    \ trans-disciplinary, scientifically informed decision support to help all actors\
    \ in the organic sector, including national and regional policy makers, to reach\
    \ the next level of the EU\u2019s organic success story. By doing so organic food\
    \ systems can be more true to organic principles but equally to the EU Bioeconomy\
    \ agenda. Organic-PLUS objectives are to; 1) identify and valorise contentious\
    \ inputs currently used in European agriculture 2) provide specific technical\
    \ solutions to minimise or phase-out their use 3) provide environmental, social\
    \ and economic assessments of phase-out scenarios 4) disseminate and broker knowledge,\
    \ ideas and results to maximise impact. We use a trans-disciplinary research approach;\
    \ the consortium includes 11 universities and 15 multi-actors from 9 EU and 3\
    \ associated countries. We combine scientists from many academic disciplines with\
    \ advisors, farmers and other stakeholders in participatory research design. Organic-PLUS\
    \ has three large \u2018topical\u2019 workpackages called PLANT (researching alternatives\
    \ to copper and mineral oils), LIVESTOCK (researching alternatives to synthetic\
    \ vitamins, antibiotics and novel animal bedding) and SOIL (researching alternatives\
    \ to peat, animal-derived fertilisers and plastic mulch). The topical work is\
    \ supported by IMPACT (researching consumer conceptions of contentious inputs\
    \ and disseminating knowledge together with stakeholders) and by MODEL (using\
    \ sustainability assessment methodology to deliver phasing-out scenarios). The\
    \ LEAD workpackage is also responsible for managing the International Scientific\
    \ and the European Industry advisory boards ensuring impact to industry and policy\
    \ development. The results of the project are disseminated through peer-reviewed\
    \ and farmer-facing publications, social media, on-farm events and international\
    \ conferences and we will also ensure impact through citizen juries and engagement\
    \ with policy makers.\n"
