  title: Modelling microbial adaptations to nutrient limitation during litter decomposition
  abstract: "Quoting T. Dobzhansky, \u201Cnothing in biology makes sense except in\
    \ the light of evolution\u201D. This idea could shed new light on how soil microbes\
    \ access, transform, store, and release their most important resources \u2013\
    \ carbon and nutrients. We know that these microbial processes have global-scale\
    \ impacts, including climate regulation and provision of nutrients to plants,\
    \ but how microbes respond to changes in resources remains challenging to understand\
    \ and quantify with models. In fact, current models cannot reliably reproduce\
    \ carbon and nutrient storage and fluxes when soils are disturbed by land use\
    \ changes or environmental fluctuations (especially of soil moisture). To address\
    \ these urgent challenges and improve predictability of carbon and nutrient cycling,\
    \ I propose a novel theory based on the premise that microbial use of soil resources\
    \ is optimized by natural selection. This approach will provide a holistic explanation\
    \ of microbial processes and yield models that are more reliable than traditional\
    \ ones because they account for microbial adaptation. After testing this optimality\
    \ hypothesis, I will answer the broader and globally relevant question \u2013\
    \ are land use and climatic changes increasing retention or loss of soil carbon\
    \ and nutrients?The project will achieve four objectives;1)\tDetermine the optimal\
    \ strategies of resource use by soil microbes2)\tFill knowledge gaps on microbial\
    \ processes by constructing new databases3)\tTest the optimality theory using\
    \ the new databases 4)\tIntegrate the optimality theory into a land surface model\
    \ to scale up results and assess impacts of land use and climatic (specifically\
    \ hydrologic) changes on carbon and nutrient storage and fluxesThese theoretical\
    \ advances will spur a new generation of soil models that translate the outcomes\
    \ of natural selection into reliable predictions of land use and climate change\
    \ effects on global ecosystems.\n"
