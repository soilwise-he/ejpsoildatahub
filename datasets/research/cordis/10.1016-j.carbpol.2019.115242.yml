    application'
  abstract: "This Marie Sklodowska Curie Individual Fellowship will bring an outstanding\
    \ experienced researcher to work in Europe and be mentored by a world leading\
    \ expert in low energy building technologies. Over the past 20 years, the Incoming\
    \ Research Fellow, Prof Fatang Jiang has specialised in biodegradable materials\
    \ and been an active technology entrepreneur by successfully commercialising his\
    \ research outcomes including polysaccharide sponges and aerogels, edible desiccants,\
    \ biodegradable and structure controllable superabsorbents for water retention,\
    \ and innovative water activity measurement. The proposed project has been carefully\
    \ chosen to match the researcher's experience in bio-sources materials with the\
    \ host scientists\u2019 expertise in low energy building technologies to produce\
    \ some innovative outcomes and create new benefits to the society in Europe. The\
    \ project aims to develop an environmentally-friendly bio-sources aerogel as the\
    \ support core for vacuum insulation panels (BioCore VIP). Thermal insulation\
    \ is a primary approach to reduce the buildings\u2019 energy demand. Aerogel,\
    \ particularly encapsulated in vacuum panel with a multilayer film, is a super\
    \ insulation material with an extremely low thermal conductivity and hence can\
    \ obtain the required thermal resistance with a very small thickness, which is\
    \ desirable commercially in order to minimise the effect of insulation on the\
    \ building usable space. Development of the proposed aerogel requires comprehensive\
    \ scientific knowledge including material preparation, freeze-drying, heat transfer\
    \ and buildings\u2019 energy analysis. Combination of the expertise between the\
    \ Incoming Researcher and the host team matches this requirement perfectly. In\
    \ addition to the scientific goals, the Incoming Researcher will contribute his\
    \ expertise on polysaccharide aerogel and soil water retention to provide training\
    \ for researchers, students and industrial contacts by hosting seminars, giving\
    \ lectures and participating in outreach activities.\n"
