  title: Phosphorus-acquisition strategies of canola, wheat and barley in soil amended

  abstract: 'European crop production is to remain competitive while reducing environmental
    impacts, requiring development and uptake of effective soil improvingcropping
    systems. The overall aim of SOILCARE is to identify and evaluate promising soil-improving
    cropping systems and agronomictechniques increasing profitability and sustainability
    across scales in Europe. A trans-disciplinary approach will be used to evaluate
    benefits anddrawbacks of a new generation of soil improving cropping systems,
    incorporating all relevant bio-physical, socio-economic and political aspects.Existing
    information from literature and long term experiments will be analysed to develop
    a comprehensive methodology for assessingperformance of cropping systems at multiple
    levels. A multi-actor approach will be used to select promising soil-improving
    cropping systems forscientific evaluation in 16 study sites across Europe covering
    different pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Implemented croppingsystems
    will be monitored with stakeholder involvement, and will be assessed jointly with
    scientists. Specific attention will be paid to adoption ofsoil-improving cropping
    systems and agronomic techniques within and beyond the study sites. Results from
    study sites will be up-scaled to theEuropean level to draw general lessons about
    applicability potentials of soil-improving cropping systems and related profitability
    and sustainabilityimpacts, including assessing barriers for adoption at that scale.
    An interactive tool will be developed for end-users to identify and prioritize
    suitablesoil-improving cropping systems anywhere in Europe. Current policies and
    incentives will be assessed and targeted policy recommendations willbe provided.
    SOILCARE will take an active dissemination approach to achieve impact from local
    to European level, addressing multiple audiences,to enhance crop production in
    Europe to remain competitive and sustainable through dedicated soil care.
