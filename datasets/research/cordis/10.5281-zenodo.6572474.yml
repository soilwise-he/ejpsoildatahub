  title: 'Micro Raman analysis of micro and nanoplastics in drinking water: from number
    to mass'
  abstract: "Micro and nanoplastics have recently been found in our soil, tap water,\
    \ bottled water, beer and even in the air we breathe, with a growing concern about\
    \ the potential health risks they pose to us. Whether that is through ingesting\
    \ the harmful bacteria they pick up when coming from wastewater plants, or just\
    \ through injury and death of cells through contact, possibly through absorbtion\
    \ of nanoplastics by cells, we really don\u2019t know. Which is why there is an\
    \ urgent need for more research on their toxicity and also why a new EC drinking\
    \ water directive is to be published in 2019 stating that water companies will\
    \ need to measure concentrations of microplastics from within two years for positive\
    \ release and inspection.  However, even though a standard measurement method\
    \ will be published in 2019 for water, its necessary use of exisiting and expensive\
    \ scientific laboratory equipment, such as microscopy and FTIR or Raman spectroscopy,\
    \ will make it prohibitively expensive for in line use for many companies across\
    \ Europe especially considering its need for highly trained personnel. There is\
    \ therefore a need to develop suitable technologies for a robust, easy to use\
    \ and low cost industrial instrument,  whose measurements will correspond directly\
    \ to the aforementiond standard, as well as train engineers for method development\
    \ and operation.  Given these multiple technical and analytical challenges, and\
    \ that global production of plastic, that can take hundreds of years to biodegrade,\
    \ is expected to triple by 2050; we propose a timely four year Initial Training\
    \ Network to train multiple Early State Researchers throughout various scientific\
    \ areas. Consisting of some of Europes greatest experts in their fields it will\
    \ provide tomorrows talent with the skills and knowledge to tackle possibly one\
    \ of mankinds greatest threats to its existence whilst they jointly develop the\
    \ technologies for the industrial instrument in collaboration with end-users and\
    \ equipment manufacturers.\n"
