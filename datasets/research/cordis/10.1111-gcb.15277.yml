  title: "Low phosphorus supply constrains plant responses to elevated CO 2 : A meta\u2010\
    analysis"
  abstract: "Nutrient availability plays a pivotal role in the response of terrestrial\
    \ ecosystems to increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate change. The global role\
    \ of nutrients is only poorly understood quantitatively, limiting the predictive\
    \ understanding of terrestrial biosphere - climate feedbacks. The first generation\
    \ of global nutrient-carbon cycle models shows strongly diverging estimates of\
    \ the nutrient effect, resulting from lacking integration of ecosystem observations\
    \ and fundamental uncertainties in the representation of governing processes.\
    \ The objective of QUINCY is to clarify the role of the interacting terrestrial\
    \ nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and their effects on terrestrial C allocation\
    \ and residence times as well as terrestrial water fluxes. QUINCY will create\
    \ a novel, predictive framework founded on the principle of resource optimisation,\
    \ shifting the paradigm of terrestrial biosphere modelling towards an active biological\
    \ control of matter flows. QUINCY\u2019s main themes are (i) the effects of nutrient\
    \ availability on plant photosynthesis and respiration, explicitly taking the\
    \ energy requirement of nutrient acquisition into account, and (ii) the effects\
    \ of vegetation-soil interactions, namely rhizosphere processes, on plant nutrient\
    \ availability and soil C turnover. To corroborate these theoretical concepts,\
    \ QUINCY will synthesise existing and ongoing ecosystem monitoring and manipulation\
    \ studies. To specifically test emerging hypotheses on the effects of rhizosphere\
    \ priming on soil C storage and plant nutrition - and to provide currently lacking\
    \ data for soil-vegetation models - QUINCY will establish a tree mesocosm, elevated\
    \ CO2 experiment. The novel model concepts will be consistently integrated to\
    \ form a new general terrestrial biosphere model. For the first time, QUINCY will\
    \ be able to address the multiway interactions of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus\
    \ and water cycles globally in a theoretically well-founded way commensurate with\
    \ ecosystem observations.\n"
