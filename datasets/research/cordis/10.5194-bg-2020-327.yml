  title: Evaluating stream CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; outgassing via
    Drifting and Anchored flux chambers in a controlled flume experiment
  abstract: 'Despite the ubiquity of expansion and retraction dynamics of flowing
    streams, the large majority of biogeochemical and hydrological studies conceive
    river networks as static elements of the landscape, and a coherent framework to
    quantify nature and extent of drainage network dynamics is lacking. The implications
    of this phenomenon extend far beyond hydrology and involve key ecological and
    biogeochemical function of riparian corridors. The proposed research project will
    move beyond the traditional paradigm of static river networks by unravelling,
    for the first time, physical causes and biogeochemical consequences of stream
    dynamics. In particular, the project will undertake the following overarching
    scientific questions; 1) what are the climatic and geomorphic controls on the
    expansion/contraction of river networks? 2) what is the length of temporary streams
    and what is their impact on catchment-scale biogeochemical processes and stream
    water quality across scales? These challenging issues will be addressed by developing
    a novel theoretical framework complemented by extensive field observations within
    four representative sites along a climatic gradient in the EU. Field measurements
    will include long-term weekly mapping of the active drainage network and daily
    hydro-chemical data across scales. The experimental dataset will be used to develop
    and inform a set of innovative modelling tools, including an analytical framework
    for the description of spatially explicit hydrologic dynamics driven by stochastic
    rainfall and a modular hydro-chemical model based on the concept of water age,
    able to account for the variable connectivity among soil, groundwater and channels
    as induced by stream network dynamics. The project will open new avenues to quantify
    freshwater carbon emissions - crucially dependent on the extent of ephemeral streams
    - and it will provide a robust basis to identify temporary rivers and maintain
    their biogeochemical function in times of global change.
