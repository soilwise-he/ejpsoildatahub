  title: Protein-rich legume and pseudo-cereal crop suitability under present and
    future European climates
  abstract: "PROTEIN2FOOD\u2019s aim is to develop innovative, cost-effective and\
    \ resource-efficient plant proteins \u2013rich food sources with positive impact\
    \ on human health, the environment and biodiversity. The quality and quantity\
    \ of protein from selected highly nutritious seed crops (quinoa, amaranth and\
    \ buckwheat), and legumes with high protein quantity (lupin, faba beans, pea,\
    \ chickpea, lentil) will be significantly enhanced  by using a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach that will include genetic, agronomic, food process engineering, sensory,\
    \ socio-economic,  and environmental assessment.Research is expected to improve\
    \ the quality of plant proteins, produced in Europe, and of the sustainability\
    \ of their production and processing. Through a better understanding of the; i)\
    \ genetic mechanisms driving the protein formation and accumulation in the seed,\
    \ ii) plant performance towards biotic and abiotic stresses, and iii) protein\
    \ interactions with other components in the food matrix and its sensory repercussions\
    \ in the final food products, this research should lead to the development of\
    \ adapted plant protein sources with positive impact on environment and biodiversity\
    \ as well as human health. Expected results in the project are; i) enhance the\
    \ protein production by 25% through new effective breeding techniques and optimised\
    \ crop management with an increase by 10% of the EU\u2019s arable land destined\
    \ to protein-crop production, using also marginal soils, ii) accelerate protein\
    \ transition from animal-based protein to plant based protein in Europe with clear\
    \ impact on reduction of carbon footprint, iii) increase EU agro-biodiversity\
    \ by introducing promising high quality crops and legumes. Further, activities\
    \ will support the prototypes of new protein-rich-protein food with exceptional\
    \ market potential. Finally, we will improve the EU\u2019s visibility in the area\
    \ of food processing and technology through high impact factors scientific publications.\n"
