  title: Abscisic Acid Coordinates Dose-Dependent Developmental and Hydraulic Responses
    of Roots to Water Deficit
  abstract: "Plants have to constantly adjust their water status during development\
    \ and in response to very changing environmental conditions, recently increased\
    \ by climate change. By exploring the soil and taking up water, plant roots play\
    \ a crucial role in these processes. Drought exerts deep effects on root functions\
    \ by altering root cell water permeability (hydraulics) and modulating the growth\
    \ and architecture of the root system. Water channel proteins named aquaporins\
    \ adjust root hydraulics in response to many stimuli, including drought stress.\
    \ Auxin plays, together with abscisic acid (ABA), a pivotal role in root growth\
    \ and development and regulates aquaporins during lateral root formation (LRF).\
    \ The present project proposes a frame for integrating these effects by exploring\
    \ functional links between root architecture, aquaporins and hydraulics, phytohormones,\
    \ and modelling. Responses to water stress will be studied from the elementary\
    \ level of LRF up to the whole root level to identify complex interactions and\
    \ signalling pathways. The Arabidopsis root was chosen as a model for accelerated\
    \ discovery, as it allows a unique combination of developmental biology, genomics,\
    \ biophysics and mathematical modelling, with the purpose to transfer this knowledge\
    \ to crops. This novel and multidisciplinary project will be carried out by a\
    \ researcher with a strong scientific expertise on agriculture and plant molecular\
    \ physiology which perfectly matches the proposed project. The latter will be\
    \ implemented within a consolidated group and an internationally recognized institution\
    \ (Aquaporin team, BPMP, CNRS/INRA/SupAgro/UM2 Montpellier, France). This combination\
    \ provides a unique scientific platform for the research training of the applicant\
    \ and the development of frontline research in plant science. The overall project\
    \ will be strongly beneficial for the development of the applicant\u2019s independent\
    \ research career and will definitely strengthen his scientific profile.\n"
