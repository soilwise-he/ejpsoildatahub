  title: 'Mathematical Reconstruction of Land Carbon Models From Their Numerical Output:
    Computing Soil Radiocarbon From 12C Dynamics'
  abstract: "The overall goal of 14Constraint is to enhance the availability and use\
    \ of radiocarbon data as constraints for process-based understanding of the age\
    \ distribution of carbon in and respired by soils and ecosystems.  Carbon enters\
    \ ecosystems by a single process, photosynthesis.  It returns by a range of processes\
    \ that depend on plant allocation and turnover, the efficiency and rate of litter\
    \ decomposition and the mechanisms stabilizing C in soils. Thus the age distribution\
    \ of respired CO2 and the age of C residing in plants, litter and soils are diagnostic\
    \ properties of ecosystems that provide key constraints for testing carbon cycle\
    \ models.  Radiocarbon, especially the transit of \u2018bomb\u2019 14C created\
    \ in the 1960s, is a powerful tool for tracing C exchange on decadal to centennial\
    \ timescales. 14Constraint will assemble a global database of existing radiocarbon\
    \ data (WP1) and demonstrate how they can constrain and test ecosystem carbon\
    \ cycle models.  WP2 will fill data gaps and add new data from sites in key biomes\
    \ that have ancillary data sufficient to construct belowground C and 14C budgets.\
    \  These detailed investigations will focus on the role of time lags caused in\
    \ necromass and fine roots, as well as the dynamics of deep soil C. Spatial extrapolation\
    \ beyond the WP2 sites will require sampling along global gradients designed to\
    \ explore the relative roles of mineralogy, vegetation and climate on the age\
    \ of C in and respired from soil (WP3).  Products of this 14Constraint will include\
    \ the first publicly available global synthesis of terrestrial 14C data, and will\
    \ add over 5000 new measurements.  This project is urgently needed before atmospheric\
    \ 14C levels decline to below 1950 levels as expected in the next decade.\n"
