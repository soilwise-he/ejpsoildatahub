    over a decade.'
  abstract: "Objectives; Provide currently unavailable geo-information on weather,\
    \ water and climate for sub-Saharan Africa by enhancing satellite-based geo-data\
    \ with innovative in situ sensors and developing related information services\
    \ that answer needs of African stakeholders and the GEOSS community.Concept; A\
    \ systematic feedback loop to reciprocally validate in situ measurements and satellite\
    \ data in one integrated model. Over 500 in situ measurement stations using citizen\
    \ science. State of the art advancement & Innovation potential; Building on and\
    \ pushing further recent advances in sensor and communication technology to provide\
    \ cheaper and more robust in situ measurements covering a wider area at a higher\
    \ resolution in sub-Saharan Africa.Working with tech-hubs in Europe and Africa\
    \ to feed creation and growth of European and African start-ups that develop sensors\
    \ and geo-services, delivering complete value chains from sensor to customer-ready\
    \ information delivery.Impact on call expectations;  -Integration of in situ components\
    \ into models based on GEOSS and Copernicus data-OGC compliant science-grade geo-data\
    \ (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) delivered to GEOSS, incl. near-real time\
    \ statistically characterized soil moisture data from Africa that can be used\
    \ operationally (not currently available) and radar derived soil moisture measurements\
    \ also available under cloudy conditions, or vegetation overgrowth-at least 20\
    \ new products for use in food, water, energy security, climate change and resilience\
    \ to natural hazards validated and ready for large-scale implementation by consortium\
    \ partners and external stakeholders-based on at least 10 innovative, cost efficient,\
    \ robust, sensors, including fast neutron coun-ter, track\xACing of convective\
    \ storms with consumer lightning sensors and accelerometer for tree-crown weighing-(Bio-degradable)\
    \ sensors reduced to one tenth to one hundredth of their current price, extremely\
    \ low-maintenance, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.\n"
