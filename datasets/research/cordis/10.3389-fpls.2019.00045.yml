  title: Construction of a High-Density Genetic Map and Identification of Loci Related
    to Hollow Stem Trait in Broccoli (Brassic oleracea L. italica)
  abstract: 'The project deals with the urgent need to provide climate-resilient cultivars
    addressed to organic vegetable production systems. These new cultivars will benefit
    organic growers, and the organic seed industry, providing much needed security
    both under current and future scenarios of climate change. In this project, we
    will exploit the genetic variation of broccoli, kohlrabi, bean and tomato for
    enhanced productivity, by exploiting up-to-date knowledge of genome structure
    and function. This work will be enhanced by the active involvement of farmers,
    advisory services, research institutes, breeding companies and food processors
    from diverse geographical/climatic contexts in Europe and Non-EU countries. The
    selection of pre-breeding/ breeding lines for the three species will be undertaken
    in organic vegetable farming systems, utilizing an annual crop rotation scheme.
    New cultivars will be selected for efficiency when grown under water, temperature,
    and nitrogen stress, for resistance to some pests and diseases, for desirable
    product quality traits such as taste, visual appearance, post-harvest performance.
    The Stakeholder Board will contribute to the expected outcomes of the project.
    Crop genetic diversity will be broad as we will be utilizing several landraces
    (LRs) and crops wild relatives (CWRs) provided by partners for the foreseen pre-breeding
    and breeding activities. We will adopt an innovative approach, where plant traits
    related to the roots-zone, and to root-growth, and architecture that enable a
    better interaction with organic soil and its microbiome, are sought to benefit
    the end-users. This approach will ensure that the available genetic resources
    and bred-germplasm, combined with the best on-farm management practices will enhance
    resource use efficiency and productivity. The germplasm from this project will
    act to pump-prime the production of new seed for the organic growing sector and
    will also serve as a model for the enhancement of other crops.
