  title: Methodological perspectives on the application of compound-specific stable
    isotope fingerprinting for sediment source apportionment
  abstract: 'This international RISE programme brings together EU, North American,
    African and Asian scientists to deliver a powerful tool for sediment management.
    Siltation of river channels, lakes and reservoirs presents a credible threat to
    river basin ecosystem service provision and water security. River silt originates
    in the catchment and the primary driver for mobilisation and translocation downstream
    is agriculture where loss of soil from slopes threatens food security. Knowledge
    of sediment source, transfer and residence time dynamics is critical to inform
    management for future food and water security and cutting-edge nuclear techniques
    have been developed in a joint UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and International
    Atomic Energy Agency Coordinated Research Programme to trace river silt back to
    source. However, the game change in isotopic biogeochemical tracer sophistication
    has led to a step change in data complexity. While these datasets capture real
    world complexity in time and space, the conventional statistical approaches to
    quantify sediment provenance from the tracer data do not. This severely limits
    the power of isotopic techniques for sediment source apportionment. Advances in
    ecological source apportionment models based on Bayesian statistics, however,
    present opportunity. New models, i.e. MixSIAR, have been shown to appropriately
    address such variability in a quantitative way and, if tailored to river basin
    sediment tracer data offer to address the above challenge. The central goal is
    to marry together the strengths of isotopic sediment tracer technology in the
    EU with ecological source apportionment models developed by North American scientists
    to deliver a powerful tool to combat threats to global food and water security.  The
    tool will be showcased through its application in water-supply catchments where
    diffuse sediment and nutrient pollution from agriculture threatens food, water
    and, through siltation of of HEP dams, energy security.
