  title: A Hybrid High-Order Method for Multiple-Network Poroelasticity
  abstract: 'Understanding subsurface geological processes is crucial for the prevention
    of environmental damage and the development of renewable alternatives for energy
    generation. The key for the successful assessment of subsurface activities is
    the ability to perform accurate numerical simulations able to predict the effects
    of soil exploitation. Envisioned research activities will focus on the design
    and analysis of advanced nonconforming polyhedral discretisation methods for simulating
    fault mechanics and fracture propagation in poroelastic media. The main goal is
    to provide an efficient mathematical and numerical framework to evaluate and prevent
    risks related to several human geological activities. In this project, we aim
    at developing and analysing new nonconforming polyhedral finite element methods
    able to tame the mathematical and numerical challenges that have to be accounted
    for in geomechanical modelling; the geometric complexity arising from the presence
    of various layers and fractures, the strong coupling between the flow and the
    mechanics, and the possible rough variations of the physical parameters. In this
    context, for inner interface and moving discontinuities problems, such as fault
    slip and fracture growth, the versatility of polyhedral finite element methods
    allows to successfully tame the geometric complexity as well as facilitate mesh
    adaptivity and provide a greater robustness with respect to mesh distortions.
    The research will target the investigation of the models describing fault mechanics
    and the interaction between propagating fractures and fluid flow. The computational
    performance of the proposed discretisation schemes will be assessed on a complete
    panel of realistic test cases.
