  title: 'A systematic comparison of commercially produced struvite: Quantities, qualities
    and soil-maize phosphorus availability'
  abstract: 'SUSFERT addresses the massive usage of mineral fertilisers in EU agriculture,
    which are largely based on non-renewable resources, but are required in intensive
    crop production for meeting demands for food and feed. SUSFERT will develop multifunctional
    fertilisers for phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) supply, which will fit into existing
    production processes and common EU agricultural practice.The SUSFERT innovation
    combines bio-based and biodegradable coatings, probiotics, the renewable P-source
    struvite, and nutrigels in at least four novel sustainable P and Fe fertiliser
    products, which may partly or fully replace unsustainable and resource-intense
    conventional ones. SUSFERT will test novel organic formulations, microgranules,
    granules, soil improvers, nutrigels and liquid fertilizer products in field trials,
    evaluate them regarding economic potential and environmental sustainability, ensure
    regulatory compliance and establish industry-scale production processes (TRL 7-8).
    Technological concepts include 1) probiotics based on P and Fe solubilizing Bacilli
    and Actinobacteria; 2) microbial siderophore (Fe chelator) produced in a demonstration
    plant; 3) enzymatic modification of the by-product lignin for cost effective,
    biodegradable controlled release coatings and product stabilization and 4) demonstration
    of  struvite, a renewable P-source from wastewater, as a partial substitute of
    mineral P. Five industrial, four SME and three academic partners will contribute
    expertise along the whole value chain in biotechnology, microbiology, large-scale
    fermentation, fertiliser production and sales. We will fit the SUSFERT products
    into the regulatory and policy context for conventional and organic agriculture
    in various pedo-climatic conditions in Europe and prepare rapid market entry post-project.
