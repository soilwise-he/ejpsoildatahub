  title: Comparison of Scenedesmus acuminatus and Chlorella vulgaris cultivation in
    liquid digestates from anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper industry and municipal
    wastewater treatment sludge
  abstract: "The Advanced Biological Waste-to-Energy Technologies (ABWET) EJD provides\
    \ education and research at PhD level on environmental technologies that convert\
    \ waste materials into bioenergy, training doctoral candidates to think globally\
    \ and work in multidisciplinary research teams. This makes ABWET alumni attractive\
    \ for European universities and industry, able to contribute to solving the global\
    \ challenges of waste management, energy scarcity and sustainable development.\
    \  ABWET is centred around environmental technologies for treatment of waste,\
    \ with a focus on anaerobic treatment processes, valorisation of the digestate\
    \ and biofuel clean-up. ABWET focuses on fundamental and applied research of different\
    \ treatment technologies as well as on the development of innovative recovery\
    \ and reuse technologies with enhanced market potential. A strong industrial participation\
    \ will bring a close connection to practical problems. ABWET provides its doctoral\
    \ candidates training through research stipulated in a PhD proposal and through\
    \ education detailed in an Individual Training and Supervision Plan, whereas a\
    \ career development plan provides guidance on career paths, the labour market\
    \ and professional development.  The ABWET EJD aims to continue the successful\
    \ Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Environmental Technologies for Contaminated Soils,\
    \ Sediments and Solid Waste (ETeCoS3), which developed a joint PhD education and\
    \ research curriculum with joint selection, supervision and PhD defence procedures.\
    \ The current three ETeCoS3 beneficiaries issue a fully joint PhD degree in Environmental\
    \ Technology, recognised by the respective academic boards. ABWET will expand\
    \ the degree awarding consortium with a 4th beneficiary, Tampere University of\
    \ Technology \u2013 Finland. A special Work Package is dedicated to adapt the\
    \ ETeCoS3 consortium agreement and streamline the PhD graduation requirements\
    \ so that ABWET graduates will receive a joint doctoral degree issued by the 4\
    \ beneficiaries.\n"
