  title: Understanding the Upgrading of Sewage Sludge-Derived Hydrothermal Liquefaction
    Biocrude via Advanced Characterization
  abstract: 'The objective of the NextGenRoadFuels project is to apply advanced HTL
    technology and subsequent upgrading to a selected range of low value/cost, concentrated
    biogenic residues from urban activity, in order to obtain cost competitive, sustainable
    drop-in quality synthetic gasoline and diesel fuels. From a highly efficient and
    validated baseline HTL process chain designed for lignocellulosics, new innovative
    process steps will be designed and existing steps optimized to address the additional
    challenges encompassed by such feedstocks, exemplified by sewage sludge, food
    waste and construction wood waste (termed urban feedstocks), with the objective
    to reach similar performance as for lignocellulosics.  The main optimization targets
    are - To establish fundamental pretreatment process and parameters to provide
    highest possible organic dry matter content in feedstock slurry and efficiently
    remove valuable inorganics that can have added value as organic fertilizers and/or
    soil improvers.  - To establish HTL processing parameters giving highest possible
    carbon and energy yields to oil phase - To establish efficient upgrading schemes
    to bring the HTL intermediate bio-crude to drop-in gasoline and diesel fuels -
    To close material and energy streams to and from the individual process steps
    in order to obtain maximum internal utilization and minimal environmental impact
    - To establish MFSP scenarios demonstrating cost-competitiveness, socio-economic
    benefits and superior LCA and GHG reduction effects in a pan-European as well
    as global perspective.  Specific targets of the NextGenRoadFuels project are to
    demonstrate the potential to convert more than 100 M tons urban feedstock per
    year into almost 500,000 barrels per day of drop-in diesel and gasoline fuels
    (more than 10 % of the current use in the EU), at a cost of approximately 50-60
    Euro-cent per liter. This will generate 50,000 direct and 300,000 indirect jobs
    within the EU, and reduce GHG emissions by more than 70%.
