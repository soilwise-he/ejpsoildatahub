  title: Products of Hexavalent Chromium Reduction by Green Rust Sodium Sulfate and
    Associated Reaction Mechanisms
  abstract: 'Thousands of sites across Europe are polluted with toxic metals and organic
    solvents; many more exist worldwide. As EU population grows, clean water will
    determine the quality of life and economic stability. Most sites remain contaminated
    because existing technology is costly and disruptive. Society needs an innovative
    way to decontaminate soil and groundwater directly underground. In METAL-AID,
    we will develop new technologies through fundamental knowledge.We are a consortium
    of experts in natural materials, contaminant reactivity, groundwater treatment
    and environment policy, spread over 4 consulting firms, 6 universities and a government
    agency. We will train 14 early stage researchers (ESRs) through integrated, intersectoral
    research, using advanced technology, ranging from nanometre to field scale. ESRs
    will gain technical, business and personal skills, as they push a promising soil
    and groundwater remediation technology toward commercialisation. To meet the METAL-AID
    goals, the ESRs will;1) Test known layered double hydroxide (LDH) and redox active
    green rust (GR) reactants that show promise for remediating toxic metals and chlorinated
    compounds and invent new ones;2) Derive thermodynamic and kinetic data, essential
    for safety assessment modelling;3) Quantify reactant effectiveness and reacted
    phase stability and compare these with natural analogues;4) Inject the new reactants
    at field sites operated by our beneficiaries.METAL-AID begins at technology readiness
    level, TRL 1 and runs to TRL 6, implementation. The government agency will provide
    guidance so our new technology complies with regulations and has promised R&D
    funding after the ETN ends, to carry it into full commercialisation. The ESRs
    will be trained to tackle challenges of concern to society, to communicate across
    sector boundaries and with the public, in a network that will last long after
    the project ends. We will provide a pool of scientists for roles in EU''s knowledge
    based economy.
