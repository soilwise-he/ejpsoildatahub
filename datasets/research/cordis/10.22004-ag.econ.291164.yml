  title: 'Bumper Crop or Dearth: An Economic Methodology to Identify the Disruptive
    Effects of Climatic Variables on French Agriculture'
  abstract: 'Humans rely for their food on agricultural products. Agricultural production
    relies on soil, climate, agricultural inputs, and farmers. The importance of climate
    and soil inputs has been recently reconsidered in agricultural production. However,
    the quantification of the impact of climate change on agricultural production
    has been conducted with regression methods that impose undesired assumptions on
    the obtained results. If it is true that climate is changing, an estimation of
    climate change impacts on agriculture free of undesired assumptions is the key
    to understanding a strategy towards a sustainable future. Going beyond the methodological
    approaches proposed in previous studies, in this action I bridge the gap between
    production economics and the agronomic and climate economics literature.The first
    contribution of this action will merge farm accountancy datasets with climatic
    and soil characteristics at the most disaggregate geographical level possible
    (at least NUTS3 or smaller location). The second contribution of this action will
    methodologically reconsider the impact of climate change on plant growth. The
    third contribution of this action proposes a generalized decomposition method
    that, either with econometric or nonparametric methods, can attribute changes
    in productivity and profitability to different groups of inputs and outputs, among
    which are soil and climate inputs. The fourth contribution evaluates the production
    practices of the farmers and shows how much climatic and soil inputs are implicitly
    valued.
