  title: 'Valuing diversification benefits through intercropping in Mediterranean
    agroecosystems: A choice experiment approach'
  abstract: 'With the long-term view of increasing diversification and biodiversity
    in Europe and fostering sustainable development of bioeconomy, the Diverfarming
    consortium come together to develop and deploy innovative farming and agribusiness
    strategies. Diverfarming will increase the long-term resilience, sustainability
    and economic revenues of agriculture across the EU by assessing the real benefits
    and minimising the limitations, barriers and drawbacks of diversified cropping
    systems under low-input agronomic practices that are tailor-made to fit the unique
    characteristics of six EU pedoclimatic regions (Mediterranean south and north,
    Atlantic central, Continental, Pannonian and Boreal), and by adapting and optimising
    the downstream value chains organization. This approach will provide; i) increased
    overall land productivity; ii) more rational use of farm land and farming inputs
    (water, energy, machinery, fertilisers, pesticides); ii) improved delivery of
    ecosystem services by increments in biodiversity and soil quality; iii) proper
    organization of downstream value chains adapted to the new diversified cropping
    systems with decreased use of energy; and iv) access to new markets and reduced
    economy risks by adoption of new products in time and space. The diversified cropping
    systems will be tested in field case studies for major crops within each pedoclimatic
    region. In the end, Diverfarming focuses on research and innovation for rural
    development, with emphasis on developing new framework systems and business models
    adapted to the rural context of each pedoclimatic area of the EU, to foster sustainable
    growth through adoption of diversification, sustainable practices and efficient
    use of resources.
