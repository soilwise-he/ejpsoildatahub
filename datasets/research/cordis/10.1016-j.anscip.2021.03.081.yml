  title: 80. Effect of breed and ruminal fraction on rumen bacterial and archaeal
    populations in sheep
  abstract: 'Although microorganisms dominate almost every ecological niche in our
    planet, it has only been during the past 10-15 years that we have begun to gain
    insights into the composition and function of microbial communities (microbiomes)
    as a consequence of major advances in High Throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies.
    These approaches have allowed a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes for the
    first time. Following initial curiosity-driven investigations of microbiomes using
    HTS technologies, the field has evolved to harness the insights provided, leading
    to the development of a new multi-billion euro industry focused on characterisation
    and modulation of microbiomes. The vast majority of this investment has been in
    the clinical space. In contrast, far less is known about microbiomes across complex
    food chains, making it difficult to harness food-chain microbiome data for the
    development of more sustainable food systems and to yield innovative products
    and applications. This is despite the evident importance of microbes throughout
    the food chain. MASTER will take a global approach to the development of concrete
    microbiome products, foods/feeds, services  or processes with high commercial
    potential, which will benefit society through improving the quantity, quality
    and safety of food, across multiple food chains, to include marine, plant, soil,
    rumen, meat, brewing, vegetable waste, and fermented foods. This will be achieved
    through mining microbiome data relating to the food chain, developing big data
    management tools to identify inter-relations between microbiomes across food chains,
    and generating applications which promote sustainability, circularity and contribute
    to waste management and climate change mitigation. We will harness microbiome
    knowledge to significantly enhance the health and resilience of fish, plants,
    soil, animals and humans, improve professional skills and competencies, and support
    the creation of new jobs in the food sector and bioeconomy.
