  title: Optimum cleaning schedule of photovoltaic systems based on levelised cost
    of energy and case study in central Mexico
  abstract: "Soiling (i.e. the accumulation of dust on photovoltaic modules) is an\
    \ issue affecting photovoltaic (PV) systems worldwide and causes significant economic\
    \ losses. An appropriate cleaning schedule can raise the energy yield of the PV\
    \ modules and reduce the operating costs, increasing the revenues and, at the\
    \ same time, limiting the need of non-renewable energy generation. NoSoilPV aims\
    \ to tackle this issue by developing a smart method capable of quantifying the\
    \ soiling accumulated on the PV modules in real time without the need of expensive\
    \ additional hardware. Moreover, through the analysis of historical precipitation\
    \ datasets and the use of weather prediction models, the algorithm developed in\
    \ this project will predict the economic impact of soiling and notify at which\
    \ time artificial cleanings should be performed in order to minimize costs and\
    \ maximize the energy production.NoSoilPV will be conducted by Dr. Leonardo Micheli\
    \ within the Centre for Advanced Studies in Energy and Environment (CEAEMA) of\
    \ the University of Ja\xE9n (Spain). CEAEMA is an ideal environment for this project,\
    \ which involves PV performance analysis, weather and dust prediction modelling\
    \ and machine learning techniques, because of the high quality research conducted\
    \ in PV and in all the multidisciplinary aspects of the project. NoSoilPV aims\
    \ to answer a number of unsolved questions in soiling and to provide the community\
    \ a useful tool to increase the energy production and the economic revenues. The\
    \ project will support the EU in its effort to increase the clean energy share\
    \ and to maximize material efficiency, leading to an increase in PV energy yield,\
    \ without the installation of new modules or systems. In addition, this fellowship\
    \ will favor the EU reintegration of Dr. Micheli and will give him the opportunity\
    \ to enhance his career as an independent researcher.\n"
