  title: "Quantifying Non\u2010Thermal Silicate Weathering Using Ge/Si and Si Isotopes\
    \ in Rivers Draining the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field, USA"
  abstract: "Enhanced thawing of the permafrost in response to warming of the Earth\u2019\
    s high latitude regions exposes previously frozen soil organic carbon (SOC) to\
    \ microbial decomposition, liberating carbon to the atmosphere and creating a\
    \ dangerous positive feedback on climate warming. Thawing the permafrost may also\
    \ unlock a cascade of mineral weathering reactions. These will be accompanied\
    \ by mineral nutrient release and generation of reactive surfaces which will influence\
    \ plant growth, microbial SOC degradation and SOC stabilisation. Arguably, weathering\
    \ is an important but hitherto neglected component for correctly assessing and\
    \ predicting the permafrost carbon feedback. The goal of WeThaw is to provide\
    \ the first comprehensive assessment of the mineral weathering response in permafrost\
    \ regions subject to thawing. By addressing this crucial knowledge gap, WeThaw\
    \ will significantly augment our capacity to develop models that can accurately\
    \ predict the permafrost carbon feedback.Specifically, I will provide the first\
    \ estimate of the permafrost\u2019s mineral element reservoir which is susceptible\
    \ to rapidly respond to enhanced thawing, and I will assess the impact of thawing\
    \ on the soil nutrient storage capacity. To determine the impact of increased\
    \ mineral weathering on mineral nutrient availability in terrestrial and aquatic\
    \ ecosystems in permafrost regions, the abiotic and biotic sources and processes\
    \ controlling their uptake and release will be unraveled by combining novel geochemical\
    \ techniques, involving the non-traditional silicon, magnesium and lithium stable\
    \ isotopes, with soil mineral and physico-chemical characterisations. I posit\
    \ that this groundbreaking approach has the potential to deliver unprecedented\
    \ insights into mineral weathering dynamics in warming permafrost regions. This\
    \ frontier research which crosses disciplinary boundaries is a mandatory step\
    \ for being able to robustly explain the role of mineral weathering in modulating\
    \ the permafrost carbon feedback.\n"
