  title: Systems knowledge for sustainable soil and land management
  abstract: "Soil health is vital for the delivery of food, energy, and biomaterials,\
    \ as well as climate action, ecosystem services and biodiversity. Pressure on\
    \ land and soil is growing due to competing demands for land and biobased products.\
    \ A sustainable soil management that satisfies the increasing demand and avoids\
    \ soil degradation requires coordinated R&I. This project will employ a multi-actor\
    \ approach to create an effective framework for action in the wider area of soil\
    \ health and land management by coordinating efforts and pooling resources, by\
    \ developing a coherent portfolio of R&I activities and by identifying criteria\
    \ for Living Labs and lighthouses to demonstrate solutions.  The CSA will bring\
    \ together the main players in soil health and management in a transdisciplinary\
    \ approach. Planned activities include the analysis of the needs for R&I on soil\
    \ and land management as expressed through stakeholder/citizen consultation and\
    \ ongoing research projects, the identification of gaps, priority areas and types\
    \ of action for intervention including Living Labs and lighthouses. The action\
    \ fields sprawl from agriculture and forestry to spatial planning, land remediation,\
    \ climate action, and disaster control. Outcomes and results will be -\tA stakeholder-based,\
    \ co-created roadmap for R&I to support the Horizon Europe Mission in the area\
    \ of Soil Health and Food.-\tImproved coordination with existing activities in\
    \ Europe and globally, thereby raising visibility and effectiveness of R&I funding.-\t\
    Identification of and learning from existing and potential Living Labs and lighthouses\
    \ for testing and demonstrating solutions in order to simultaneously satisfy competing\
    \ demands of soil use.With its activities, the CSA will support the EC and the\
    \ Mission Board of the Horizon Europe Mission in the area of Soil Health and Food\
    \ in delivering the objectives.\n"
