  title: Pathogens Suppress Host Transcription Factors for Rampant Proliferation
  abstract: 'Fungi have a devastating impact on human nutrition and health. Each year,
    fungal pathogens provoke enormous agricultural losses in crop plants and contaminating
    food with harmful mycotoxins. The soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum
    infects plant root and vascular tissue, causing wilt disease in over a hundred
    different crops, including both dicots and monocots. A particular aggressive strain
    of this pathogen, tropical race 4, is threatening banana plantations worldwide.
    Currently, there is little information on the crucial biotrophic infection stage
    of vascular pathogens, from penetration of root to colonization of xylem vessels.
    Fusarium provides an excellent model to investigate the cell-specific sensing
    and adaptation and suppression of plant immunity related to early infection stages.
    The host group has recently reported the chemotrophic sensing mechanism used by
    this pathogen, and identified host plant signals perceived by Fusarium in the
    soil. Moreover, their work revealed a combined action of enzymes involved in fungal
    cell wall remodelling and plant cell wall degradation which contributes in virulence
    of this pathogen. In this project, we aim to identify the cell-specific virulence
    genes that F. oxysporum uses to colonize a dicot host (Arabidopsis) versus monocot
    (Banana) that has a fundamentally distinct vascular tissue architecture. We will
    use dual RNA-Seq coupled with Laser capture microdissection (LCM) to identify
    core compatibility components in both the pathogen and the plant, that are essential
    for establishing wilt disease. This will lead to identification and characterization
    of potential targets in this interaction that could be used to develop novel resistance
    strategies in ongoing banana breeding efforts. This project will thus advance
    fundamental knowledge of how a fungus senses and colonizes such a broad host range,
    while creating new opportunities for crop protection by dissecting the interaction
    at a cell-type specific resolution.
