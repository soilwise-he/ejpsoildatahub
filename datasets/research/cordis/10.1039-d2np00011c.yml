  abstract: "The prosperity of plants and human beings is dependent on the outer layer\
    \ of soil that makes up our planet\u2019s shell. Curiously, a significant portion\
    \ of plants' most precious elements, carbon and nitrogen, is secreted by roots\
    \ into soil in the form of chemically-rich exudates. This is not merely 'dumping'\
    \ of waste but rather the chemical language of plants, used in their underground\
    \ communication with billions of detrimental and beneficial microorganisms. Yet,\
    \ an important question remains to date; How do plants control and manipulate\
    \ root metabolism and exudation in time and space to fine-tune this complex underground\
    \ web of interactions to their benefit? The proposed project takes on this challenging\
    \ question and aims to decipher the newly discovered process we term 'SIREM',\
    \ for 'Systemic Induced Root Exudation of Metabolites'. SIREM is a fundamental\
    \ feature of rhizosphere interactions, in which biotic stimuli occur locally and\
    \ exudation in systemic parts of the root \u2018conditions\u2019 the rhizosphere\
    \ environment to maintain plant fitness. SIREM objectives include; (i) dissecting\
    \ the SIREM signaling pathways, focusing primarily on the mobile signal(s) and\
    \ receiving proteins at the systemic root; (ii) discovery of the exudation machinery\
    \ and its genetic control; and (iii) establishing the role of SIREM signaling\
    \ and exudation-metabolites in shaping the rhizosphere microbiome. The unconventional\
    \ integration of approaches in SIREM underscores the unique combination of our\
    \ team's expertise in plant metabolism, computational biology, microbiome exploration\
    \ and the application of cutting-edge analytical and molecular technologies for\
    \ high-resolution spatial-temporal profiling. Outcomes of the project will have\
    \ wide-ranging impacts on understanding systemic signaling and metabolic and transport\
    \ systems in plants and are anticipated to drive the new biotechnological concept\
    \ of 'Exudation Agriculture'.\n"
