  title: 'Smoothed millennial-scale palaeoclimatic reference data as unconventional
    comparison targets: Application to European loess records'
  abstract: 'The practice of tuning different climate proxies prevents the observation
    of regional response times of terrestrial archives to global changes. Thus, it
    is imperative to develop correlation protocols based on absolute chronologies.
    Loess-palaeosol deposits are continental archives of Quaternary paleoclimates
    and loess is generally considered an ideal material for the application of luminescence
    dating. The agreement obtained for 10-20 ka ages using different techniques has
    given us confidence in using the state of the art measurement protocols for young
    deposits, as confirmed by comparison with independent age control. INTERTRAP proposes
    detailed investigations of loess samples from three continents collected in close
    proximity to the transition to the recent soil, with the purpose of obtaining
    a temporal quantification of the ending of the Late Tardiglacial and the beginning
    of the Holocene. However, a series of recent luminescence investigations carried
    out on quartz of different grain sizes extracted from Romanian and Serbian loess
    yielded severe age discrepancies for ages >~40 ka. While the cause of this observation
    is hitherto not fully explained, our ongoing studies on Chinese loess prove that
    it is a general effect, potentially affecting deposits worldwide, and raising
    doubts on previous chronologies. Methodological studies within INTERTRAP will
    develop an integrated approach using optically stimulated luminescence, thermoluminescence
    and electron spin resonance investigations. This part of the study aims at unravelling
    the mechanism responsible for the observed discrepancies and developing innovative
    trapped charge dating measurement protocols based on quartz that will yield reliable
    ages for and beyond the last interglacial glacial cycle.
