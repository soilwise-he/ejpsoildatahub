  title: Methane oxidation processes in sediment of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas
    indicated from microbial lipids and carbon isotope composition
  abstract: 'Arctic permafrost (PF) as vulnerable carbon stock to global warming is
    increasingly receiving attention due to significant importance in global climate
    change. Immense carbon stock is held in surface soils on land, coastal Pleistocene
    Ice Complex Deposit and sediment of shallow subsea in Arctic. Under global warming,
    the emission of greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 from PF could further intensify global
    warming; however, the key link between thawing PF and greenhouse gas emission
    -microbial degradation remains poorly understood. Microbial degradation of organic
    matter and its response to thawing is conducive to understanding the biogeochemical
    carbon cycle and even the future prediction of greenhouse gases in Arctic. To
    better understand microbial mediation on PF-carbon feedback to global warming,
    this proposal aims to quantitatively estimate the microbial activity and metabolism
    in different types of PF (inland, coastal Ice Complex Deposit and marine sediment
    of subsea PF) from the northeast Siberian via multidisciplinary techniques including
    microcosm incubation, lipid-based stable isotope probing, modelled metabolic flux
    analysis and metabolomics. This proposal will improve the understanding of microbial
    ecosystem in response to thawing PF and their roles in biogeochemical carbon cycle
    in Arctic.
