  title: 2D Dynamic Directional Amplification (DDA) in Phononic Metamaterials
  abstract: "IINSPIRE aims to foster a new generation of highly qualified researchers\
    \ and engineers, which will create a critical mass kernel, able to implement a\
    \ holistic and novel soil-foundation-structure concept for the efficient protection\
    \ of structures from all ground induced hazards, including earthquakes and all\
    \ other sources of low-frequency noise and vibration excitations. This concept\
    \ offers a drastic breakthrough over the existing approaches in crucial aspects;A)Wave\
    \ inhibition capabilities over broadband low-frequency excitation in all three\
    \ spatial directions B)General applicability to broad classes of structures and\
    \ infrastructures C)Simple, reliable and resilient design,  leading to easy and\
    \ low-cost implementation and maintenanceINSPIRE mainly relies on recent innovative\
    \ scientific and technological concepts, mainly developed within the broad concept\
    \ of meta-materials.  The notion of \u201Cmeta-materials\u201D refers to natural\
    \ or artificial materials or structures which exhibit extraordinary properties\
    \ for inhibiting or conditioning wave propagation in all spatial directions over\
    \ broad frequency bands.  Quite recently, the feasibility of the application of\
    \ meta-material concepts has been also demonstrated for seismic and infrasound\
    \ waves. These general developments of metamaterials will be further enriched\
    \ and advanced through novel absorption and isolation concepts, such as negative\
    \ effective mass and stiffness\n"
