  title: 'Societal importance of Antarctic negative feedbacks on climate change: blue
    carbon gains from sea ice, ice shelf and glacier losses'
  abstract: "The Arctic Ocean receives a vast amount of organic carbon via runoff\
    \ from surrounding glaciers and thawing permafrost soils. This dissolved organic\
    \ matter (DOM) comprises one of the world\u2019s largest active carbon pools,\
    \ i.e. can be respired to CO2 by heterotrophic organisms. Yet our understanding\
    \ of how well this terrestrial carbon is degraded in the marine environment is\
    \ poor. As recent climate warming accelerates the input of carbon to the coastal\
    \ Ocean it becomes more urgent to study this matter as it may play a major part\
    \ in determining whether the Arctic Ocean becomes a sink or a source of CO2 in\
    \ the future. In the saltwater-freshwater interface of coastal environments, the\
    \ salinity change causes the charge of the DOM molecules to change causing about\
    \ 10-20% of this carbon pool to aggregate/flocculate into larger particles. Bacteria\
    \ are the main degraders of DOM, however, with flocculation, a great proportion\
    \ of the carbon becomes available to larger heterotrophic organisms, such as pelagic\
    \ protists and benthic filter feeders. Via these flocs the carbon enters the food\
    \ web at a higher level and escapes the microbial loop. This path is however rarely\
    \ considered. The overall aim of this project is to improve the knowledge on the\
    \ response of heterotrophic organisms to terrestrial organic carbon supply (both\
    \ from glaciers and soils) with focus on the coastal ecosystems of Greenland.\
    \ I will track the degradation paths of both DOM and flocculated DOM using a combination\
    \ of controlled laboratory studies and field studies using radioisotope tracers.\
    \ The project \u2018FlocDOM\u2019 proposes a much-needed effort for a holistic\
    \ ecological approach to assess the effects of increased runoff in the Arctic\
    \ and to quantify for the first time the salt-induced aggregation, subsequent\
    \ mineralization and burial of various terrestrial DOM pools in the Arctic.\n"
