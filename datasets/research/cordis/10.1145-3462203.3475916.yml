  title: Environmental Intelligence for more Sustainable Infrastructure Investment
  abstract: "Time is running out to achieve a more sustainable development.  Post\
    \ COVID-19 economic stimuli need to deploy a green new deal (GND) that ReSETs\
    \ economic systems to create secure and meaningful employment whilst protecting\
    \ nature for people, for climate change and flood mitigation, temperature regulation,\
    \ pollution prevention and soil and biodiversity conservation.  This green new\
    \ deal needs to harness safe, renewable technologies and nature-based solutions.\
    \  A business as usual (BAU) post-COVID stimulus would embed employment, economic\
    \ and environmental precarity in what is now fundamentally an unsustainable and\
    \ unequitable model.RESET aims to leverage developments in spatial modelling,\
    \ artificial intelligence and interoperable environmental sensing to better understand\
    \ pathways to RESET agricultural and urban development across Europe for sustainability.\
    \ For agriculture we will examine BAU versus an alternative trajectory of regenerative\
    \ agriculture and rewilding.  For cities we will examine BAU vs a more telecommuting\
    \ focused trajectory of  lowered densities, re-greening, traffic reduction to\
    \ reduce (air, water, noise) pollution and improve the quality of urban life.\
    \  In all cases we will examine impacts on employment, environment and economy.We\
    \ focus on farmland and urban land uses as understudied environments and as key\
    \ for sustainable development. We will build upon the success of our previous\
    \ work in developing spatial policy support systems and accompanying user-led\
    \ design processes, to further develop and integrate advanced environmental sensor\
    \ networks with a focus on per-person individualised employment, economic and\
    \ environmental outcomes of investments. This will require environmental and social\
    \ intelligence to an unprecedented degree bringing together environmental modelling,\
    \ advanced sensor research, social science and stakeholders\u2019 engagement,\
    \ and artificial intelligence to go way beyond conventional environmental impact\
    \ assessment approaches.\n"
