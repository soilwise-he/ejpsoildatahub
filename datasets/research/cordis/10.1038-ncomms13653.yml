  title: Massive remobilization of permafrost carbon during post-glacial warming
  abstract: "The enormous quantities of frozen carbon in the Arctic, held in shallow\
    \ soils and sediments, act as \u201Ccapacitors\u201D of the global carbon system.\
    \ Thawing permafrost (PF) and collapsing methane hydrates are top candidates to\
    \ cause a net transfer of carbon from land/ocean to the atmosphere this century,\
    \ yet uncertainties abound. Our program targets the East Siberian Arctic Ocean\
    \ (ESAO), the World\u2019s largest shelf sea, as it holds 80% of coastal PF, 80%\
    \ of subsea PF and 75% of shallow hydrates. Our initial findings (e.g., Science,\
    \ 2010; Nature, 2012; PNAS; 2013; Nature Geoscience, 2013, 2014) are challenging\
    \ earlier notions by showing complexities in terrestrial PF-Carbon remobilization\
    \ and extensive venting of methane from subsea PF/hydrates. The objective of the\
    \ CC-Top Program is to transform descriptive and data-lean pictures into quantitative\
    \ understanding of the CC system, to pin down the present and predict future releases\
    \ from these \u201CSleeping Giants\u201D of the global carbon system.The CC-Top\
    \ program combines unique Arctic field capacities with powerful molecular-isotopic\
    \ characterization of PF-carbon/methane to break through on;The \u201Cawakening\u201D\
    \ of terrestrial PF-C pools; CC-Top will employ great pan-arctic rivers as natural\
    \ integrators and by probing the \u03B413C/\u039414C and molecular fingerprints,\
    \ apportion release fluxes of different PF-C pools.The ESAO subsea cryosphere/methane;\
    \ CC-Top will use recent spatially-extensive observations, deep sediment cores\
    \ and gap-filling expeditions to (i) estimate distribution of subsea PF and hydrates;\
    \ (ii) establish thermal state (thawing rate) of subsea PF-C; (iii) apportion\
    \ sources of releasing methane btw subsea-PF, shallow hydrates vs seepage from\
    \ the deep petroleum megapool using source-diagnostic triple-isotope fingerprinting.Arctic\
    \ Ocean slope hydrates; CC-Top will investigate sites (discovered by us 2008-2014)\
    \ of collapsed hydrates venting methane, to characterize geospatial distribution\
    \ and causes of destabilization.\n"
