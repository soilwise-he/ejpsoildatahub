  title: Multi-dimensionality as a path forward in plant-soil feedback research
  abstract: 'Terrestrial ecosystems are important in providing key services to humankind,
    but under global warming the provisioning of such ecosystem services is at risk.
    However, there is little consensus on how the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems
    will change under projected scenarios of global warming, or when we will reach
    or surpass thresholds and tipping points. This is largely because most studies
    have failed to unravel ecosystem responses to increasing temperatures in terms
    of the underlying non-linear responses of plants, soil organisms, and their communities.
    Since plants and their associated soil organisms (i.e., pathogens, mutualists,
    and decomposers) can vary in their responses to temperature change, global warming
    may disrupt or decouple interactions among coexisting and co-evolved species.
    This may have unforeseen consequences for key ecosystem functions, such as carbon
    and nutrient cycling.THRESHOLD will use a novel cross-disciplinary approach to
    advance our fundamental knowledge of how non-linear temperature responses transcend
    different levels of ecological organization. Specifically, this project aims to;1)
    Establish a global network of forest-tundra and forest-alpine ecotone sites, to
    assess how responses of ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling to global warming
    will be pushed across thresholds and tipping points.2) Perform mesocosm experiments
    under different temperatures, to estimate how ecosystem process responses to global
    warming can be predicted from the reordering of plant and soil communities, as
    well as from the functional traits that they possess and express.3) Reveal how
    community responses to warming and extreme temperatures can be predicted from
    the physiological responses of their component species.To achieve these aims,
    this work will utilize a powerful approach that harnesses an array of cutting-edge
    tools, and it will advance our conceptual understanding in an area of urgent importance
    for ecology and society.
