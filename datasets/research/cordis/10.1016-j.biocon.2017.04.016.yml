  title: "Genetic consequences of landscape change for rare endemic plants \u2013\
    \ A case study of Rhinanthus osiliensis"
  abstract: 'Diffuse losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural areas contribute
    significantly to eutrophication of waterways, lakes, estuaries and coastal zones
    and water pollution is a growing and serious problem across much of the world.
    The role of wetlands in improving surface water quality is well known. The capacity
    of wetlands to improve water quality is dependent on a large number of parameters
    that have been widely studied, such as vegetation cover or type, water retention
    time, climatic variables, and also their size and spatial arrangement in the watershed.
    However, the question where wetlands should be located in agricultural catchments
    to achieve the most effective nutrient removal at the catchment level has not
    been clearly resolved. This project aims to determine the optimal sizing and location
    for wetlands in agricultural catchments to reduce nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus)
    loads in catchments. The study consist of two parts performed on study areas with
    different landscape and climatic conditions. Firstly, potentially suitable wetland
    restoration/creation sites are identified by using high quality data and geospatial
    analysis techniques. Secondly, evaluation of the effectiveness of wetland nitrogen
    and phosphorus removal from surface waters at various potential locations indicated
    by the geospatial analyses under different hydrological regimes and land use scenarios
    will be done by using modelling with CLUES (Catchment Land Use for Environmental
    Sustainability model) and SWAT (Soil and Water and Assessment Tool). Important
    role in the study is also on using and integrating different datasets and modelling
    approaches.
