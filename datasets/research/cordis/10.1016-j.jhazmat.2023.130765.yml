  title: 'Fragmentation and depolymerization of microplastics in the earthworm gut:
    A potential for microplastic bioremediation?'
  abstract: "Plastics have become a key component of modern agriculture, both directly,\
    \ through their use in production systems, such as greenhouse cover films and\
    \ silage bags, and indirectly, such as through the application of sewage sludge\
    \ or compost. However, we know almost nothing about the fate of this plastic and\
    \ its impact on soil functions. The SOPLAS ETN will address this critical knowledge\
    \ gap, while delivering significant advances in understanding the plastic cycle\
    \ within soil and supporting the development of environmental policies, agricultural\
    \ practices and industrial opportunities related to mitigating the impact of plastics\
    \ on the environment. More specifically, SOPLAS will; (i) adapt and optimise existing\
    \ tools to detect and quantify macro- and microplastic input into agricultural\
    \ soils; (ii) improve understanding of the degradation mechanisms of conventional\
    \ and biodegradable plastic, as basis of optimizing used plastic materials and\
    \ identifying remediation pathways; (iii) determine the impact of microplastic\
    \ on soil functions and soil health; (iv) identify pathways for microplastic export\
    \ from agricultural soils to freshwater ecosystems; and (v) analysis farmers\u2019\
    \ and consumers\u2019 willingness to reduce the input of plastic material into\
    \ agricultural soils. To address these project aims and train a new generation\
    \ of leading experts understanding the nexus of plastic-agriculture-soil, SOPLAS\
    \ will bring together a truly multidisciplinary team of academic and industry\
    \ experts, comprising economists, agronomists, hydrologists, soil scientists,\
    \ microbiologists and chemists, using the most advanced state-of-the-art approaches\
    \ in their respective fields. The training network will facilitate a dialogue\
    \ between researchers, industry and practitioners with as ultimate goal to advance\
    \ the sustainable use of plastics in European agriculture.\n"
