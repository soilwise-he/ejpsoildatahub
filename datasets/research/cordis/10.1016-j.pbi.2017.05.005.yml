  title: Small peptide signaling pathways modulating macronutrient utilization in
    plants
  abstract: 'Plants in the legume (Fabaceae) family are able to fix atmospheric N2
    under N-limiting conditions, thereby diminishing the need for N-fertilization.
    N2-fixation has a high requirement for photosynthates and ATP, and is thus tightly
    controlled by both the N-availability in the soil and P-level in the plant. Increasing
    the P-uptake through formation of branched root system and abundant root hairs
    will increase the N2-fixing capacity and thereby improve the overall nutrient
    use efficiency (NUE). Small signalling peptides are a largely un-characterized
    group of regulatory molecules in plants that induce signal transduction pathways
    upon binding to their complementary receptor signalling modules. Even in the most
    studied model plant Arabidopsis thaliana only a few of the more than one thousand
    putative SSPs have been characterized. Very recent work has revealed unique roles
    of SSPs in alteration of the root system architecture in response to nutrient
    availability, including the formation of root hairs under P-limiting conditions.
    Hence, a deeper understanding of the functional roles of SSPs appears to be of
    key importance for improving NUE.  This project aims at advancing our knowledge
    of SSPs involved in the adaptation to nutrient limiting conditions in legumes
    beyond current state-of-the-art. This will be achieved using a novel bottom-up
    bioinformatic approach and unique mutant populations. The scientific objectives
    are (i) to identify the receptor signalling module and the down-stream target
    genes in the signal transduction pathway of a newly discovered P-responsive SSP
    essential for root hair formation, and (ii) to discover unknown N- and P-responsive
    SSPs in the roots and nodules of the legume model species Medicago truncatula
    with the aim of (iii) investigating the effect of SSPs on improving NUE. The proposed
    work will substantially advance our understanding of the functions in which SSPs
    are involved and will open up for new solutions aimed at improving NUE.
