  title: 'Laser Weeding with Small Autonomous Vehicles: Friends or Foes?'
  abstract: "A growing global population demands increasing food production, which\
    \ requires increasing use of pesticides and fertilizers. About 130 million tons\
    \ of herbicides per year are used in Europe alone that persist in the environment,\
    \ destroy non-target plants and beneficial insects for the soil and produce health\
    \ effects in animals and humans \u2013cancer, birth defects and endocrine disruption.\
    \ Moreover, existing herbicides become more and more ineffective due to the evolution\
    \ and spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. Substitution of herbicides by mechanical\
    \ automatic systems is under study, but mechanical solutions contribute to deteriorate\
    \ the soil properties, harm beneficial soil organisms and provide poor results\
    \ for in-row weeding.WeLASER solution focuses on non-chemical weed management\
    \ based on applying lethal doses of energy on the weed meristems using a high-power\
    \ laser source. An AI-vision system discriminates crops from weeds and detects\
    \ the position of the weed meristems to point the laser on them using a laser\
    \ scanner. An autonomous vehicle carries these systems all over the field. A smart\
    \ controller coordinates these systems and uses IoT and cloud computing techniques\
    \ to manage agricultural knowledge. This technology will provide a clean solution\
    \ to the weeding problem and will help to decrease significantly the chemicals\
    \ on the environment. The required technologies for building this system and the\
    \ number of actors needed to push it close to market demands the participation\
    \ of ten experienced groups not easily found at the national level. Moreover,\
    \ the cost of this high-technological equipment exceeds the funding levels of\
    \ national organizations and claims the collaboration of large governmental institutions.\
    \ Thus, with the EC help, WeLASER will put to work a large group of actors and\
    \ stakeholders to advance in achieving the demanded productivity in agriculture\
    \ while making the environment more sustainable and enhancing health to animals\
    \ and humans.\n"
