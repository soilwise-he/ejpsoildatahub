  title: Pyrolysed waste materials show potential for remediation of trichloroethylene-contaminated
    water
  abstract: "Waste disposal and treatment is a major source of contamination of soils,\
    \ surface and groundwater, and accounts for 35% of the 1.1 million contaminated\
    \ sites in Europe. Leaching of the organic solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) into\
    \ groundwater has been identified as a primary issue with unlined landfills ,\
    \ affecting up to 70% of leachates tested. Mainly used as a metal degreaser and\
    \ dry-cleaning reagent, TCE is difficult to treat; current treatment methods,\
    \ such as anaerobic digestion  or air stripping , are ineffective and/or expensive.\
    \ This project will investigate the use biochar, or other appropriate media, for\
    \ treatment of TCE contaminated water via two technologies - permeable reactive\
    \ interceptors (PRIs) and permeable contaminant retaining filter (PCRF) bags.\
    \ This novel, low-cost solution will address the requirements of European Union\
    \ (EU) legislation, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The project\
    \ will be based at the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) with supervision\
    \ by Dr Mark Healy (GeoEnvironmental Engineering Research Group \u2013 GENE) and\
    \ support from Dr Florence Abram (Functional Environmental Microbiology - FEM).\
    \ As the applicant has experience in TCE treatment from a microbial background,\
    \ this highly novel, interdisciplinary proposal will compliment and strengthen\
    \ her existing skillset by approaching this technology from an engineering perspective,\
    \ with support from a research group that has a strong track record in this research\
    \ area. With detailed career development assistance, multiple opportunities to\
    \ further her strong publication record, access to numerous and varied fora for\
    \ dissemination of results and support for IP exploitation, this proposal will\
    \ have a significant impact in reintegrating the applicant back into the EU research\
    \ community from her current research position in New Zealand.\n"
