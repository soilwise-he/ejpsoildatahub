  title: Connectivity and pore accessibility in models of soil carbon cycling
  abstract: 'Bacterial dispersal is a key driver of pollutant turnover in contaminated
    soils. Flagellated bacteria able to degrade organic pollutants hold tactic responses
    to a variety of stimuli and reach pollutant hotspots, enhancing the access to
    poorly bioavailable carbon sources by steepening pollutant concentration gradients
    at interfaces. However, bacterial motility in porous media is often restricted
    due to high cell deposition rates and adhesion to soil particles, and in this
    sense, the modulating role of biological and chemical effectors is decisive. The
    aim of BIOTAC is the study of the mechanisms operating with flagellated bacteria
    for bioavailability enhancements and, therefore, a faster turnover of persistent
    organic pollutants in soils, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a
    pesticide, lindane. We will study, at the microorganism scale, the role of bacterial
    taxis in chemical gradients (chemotaxis), as well as other tactic responses (repellence,
    surface taxis) in pollutant bioavailability, modelling and integrating them with
    other microbial adaptations (i.e. biofilm formation and the production of biosurfactants).
    We will develop strategies to improve bacterial transport to pollutant sources,
    using carefully selected biological and chemical effectors (respectively including,
    mycelial networks and organic compounds -root exudates, humic acids, and fertilizers),
    that favour flagella-mediated taxis, and co-mobilization of immotile degrading
    strains. The originality and innovation of the project lies on the macroscale
    projection of the microscale mechanisms underlying the access of self-propelled
    bacteria to limitedly available contaminants through an enhanced dispersal. Through
    experimental and modelling approaches, aiming at balancing biosorption and colloidal
    transport of the pollutants against biodegradation rates, the project will perform
    a risk and benefit analysis of the new bioremediation technology.
