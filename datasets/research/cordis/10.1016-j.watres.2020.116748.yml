  title: Electro-bioremediation of nitrate and arsenite polluted groundwater
  abstract: 'The ELECTRA project is a EU-China RTD joint initiative that will deliver
    2 innovative sets of novel electromicrobiology based environmental biotechnologies,
    facilitating/improving electron transfer during microbial degradation processes.
    Our approach will accelerate the elimination of several classes of pollutants
    and mixtures thereof in contaminated wastewater, groundwater, sediment and soil.
    The first set of biotechnologies employs bioelectrochemical systems requiring
    low energy input and no chemical addition. The second set comprises biotechnologies,
    which necessitate no energy input and minimal chemical amendment using electromicrobial
    concepts. ELECTRA biotechnologies will build on recent groundbreaking advances
    in biotechnology to develop them for environmental bioremediation applications
    and test the 4 most advanced technologies during field trials under various environmentally
    relevant conditions in both Europe (4 sites with contaminated wastewater, groundwater,
    soil, and sediment) and China (4 sites; mirroring tests concept) to prove their
    efficiency and robustness. The ELECTRA project deliberately addresses the accelerated
    elimination of compounds representative of hydrocarbons and derivatives, emerging
    pollutants, metals and nutrients and mixtures thereof in environmentally relevant
    concentration as a wise and careful approach taking into account the real problem
    of contaminations by organic and inorganic pollutants as well as nutrients. ELECTRA
    is a consortium of European and Chinese partners for a 4-year project. The EC-funded
    consortium gathers 17 partners from 6 EU countries,1 Associated Country. 1 large
    Chinese company is part of the EC consortium without claiming any funding from
    the EC since NSFC finances only fundamental research and does not allow for the
    inclusion of companies as partners in NSFC projects. This company has a key/essential
    role in replicating field test experiments from European sites to Chinese sites.
    The NSFC-funded consortium is constituted by five research institutions acting
    as international partners.
