  title: Microbial inputs at the litter layer translate climate into altered organic
    matter properties
  abstract: "The role of plants in the global methane (CH4) cycle remains poorly understood.\
    \ Plants can emit CH4 from aerobic methane production (AMP), microbial methanogenesis\
    \ within plants (MMP), and the export soil methane (SM) via plant tissues. These\
    \ plants-associated CH4 emissions may be quantitatively significant (15-65% of\
    \ all natural CH4 emissions) but remain poorly constrained. So far, field studies\
    \ have only quantified the sum of all these plant-atmosphere CH4 fluxes, limiting\
    \ the degree to which each process can be mathematically described and incorporated\
    \ into CH4 budgets and models. I am an experienced stable isotope biogeochemist.\
    \ The MSCA fellowship will allow me to work a world leading group focused on the\
    \ measurement and modeling of plant-atmosphere trace gas fluxes. Together, we\
    \ will (a) develop a method to separately quantify AMP, MMP, and SM emissions\
    \ from plants based on the CH4 isotope values (\u03B413C, \u03B42H, and \u0394\
    14C) and methanol co-emissions (MeOH;CH4), and (b) apply this method to  methane\
    \ emissions from boreal forest trees at the SMEAR II research site in Southern\
    \ Finland.Reaching these goals will require (1) adapting stem and shoot enclosure\
    \ chambers to collect CH4 for offline analysis; (2) identifying characteristic\
    \ CH4 isotope and MeOH;CH4 values of AMP, MMP, and SM; (3) measuring isotope and\
    \ MeOH;CH4 values of plant CH4 emissions at SMEAR II, and (4) developing a Bayesian\
    \ petitioning model for plant CH4 emissions.\n"
