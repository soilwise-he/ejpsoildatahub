  abstract: 'TUdi is conceived as a transformative project, integrating 15 academic
    and SME partners, to develop, upscale and disseminate soil restoring strategies
    in three major agricultural systems (cereal based rotations, tree crops and grasslands),
    different farm typologies and environmental conditions in Europe, China and New
    Zealand. Aimed to lead the way in improving soil health across EU, China and New
    Zealand, it rests on two pillars; 1) a network of 42 cooperating stakeholder organisations
    for defining, implementing and upscaling soil restoring strategies in multiple
    farms; b) a network of 66 long-term experiments and monitored farms in the participating
    countries. From them, TUdi will identify soil degradation situations, proven strategies
    for restoring soil health, and barriers and possibilities for its adoption at
    farm level, including gender dimensions. This bottom-up approach will develop
    a set of digital tools, compatible with platforms for optimizing CAP implementation
    in Europe, to predict the impact of these strategies on nutrient and water balance,
    yield, cost-benefit and farm operations. They will guide farmers in implementing
    strategies to restore soil health by overcoming barriers for adoption, with rigorous
    cost-benefit analyses central to farmer appraisal. Solutions will be scaled up
    over a large number of farms through partners engaged in the cooperators network,
    including training of stakeholders, developing technical materials and elaborating
    policy briefs. It will be complemented by communicating project challenges and
    results to society, raising awareness of the relevance of healthy soils for sustainable
    development. Providing a blueprint for development and dissemination of soil restoring
    strategies at large scale, it will contribute to key initiatives like the EU and
    China Research Agenda for Agriculture and EU Mission on Soil Heath and Food. Training
    farmers, staff and early career scientists in sustainable soil use will result
    in lasting legacy.
