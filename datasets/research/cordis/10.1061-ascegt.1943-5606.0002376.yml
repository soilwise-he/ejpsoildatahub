  title: Response of Framed Buildings on Raft Foundations to Tunneling
  abstract: 'In urban areas, tunnels for infrastructure and services are increasingly
    important. The project aims to develop numerical solutions of tunnelling beneath
    buildings and bridges supported by pile and piled raft foundations, focusing on
    structural deformations and reductions of pile capacity. The effect of compensation
    grouting is also addressed to optimize its design and minimize its risks. Two
    novel simulation approaches are proposed to account for both stress variations
    and movements within the soil caused by pile installation, tunnelling and grouting;
    1) a simplified formulation, with low computational costs, that combines analytical
    two-stage analysis methods with cavity theory and nonlinear pile-soil load transfer
    mechanisms; 2) the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) model to accurately model
    the entire soil-structure domain. An online damage assessment system is proposed
    to facilitate the implementation of outcomes in the construction and educational
    sectors. Prof Jimenez, highly skilled in numerical and analytical methods for
    tunnelling engineering, will guide the fellow to the delivery of the simplified
    solutions. The CIMNE research team, world-leader in development of PFEM, will
    lead the researcher to implement the advanced numerical models. Partner organisations
    will provide experimental data from high-gravity tests and field measurements
    for validation; in particular, the industrial partner will guarantee that this
    research tackles real-world engineering. The experienced researcher, specialised
    in two-stage solutions and experimental testing of tunnel-structure interaction,
    will acquire new computational and theoretical skills in a wide variety of approaches
    while enhancing his mentoring and teaching capability. The end-users will have
    full access to results and developed models; this will maximise academic impact
    and it will help the construction sector to deliver more cost-effective and sustainable
    tunnelling projects, with benefits for the society.
