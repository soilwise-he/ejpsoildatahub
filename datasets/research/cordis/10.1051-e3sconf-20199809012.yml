  title: Dissolved fluoride removal by OCP, a precursor of apatite
  abstract: 'FLOWERED objective is to contribute to the development of a sustainable
    water management system in areas affected by fluoride (F) contamination in water,
    soils and food in the African Rift Valley countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania),
    thus to improve living standards (environmental, health and food security) of
    its population. FLOWERED aims to study, test and implement innovative defluoridation
    technologies for drinking and irrigation water that will mainly operate at small
    village scale and to develop an integrated, sustainable and participative water
    and agriculture management at a cross-boundary catchment scale. On the basis of
    the complexity of the issue of water de-fluoridation, the proposed scientific
    approach in FLOWERED is based on a detailed knowledge of the geological and hydrogeological
    setting that controls contamination of water that constitute the prerequisite
    for the implementation of a sustainable water management and for the proposal
    of sustainable and suitable strategies for water sanitation and agricultural system.
    Innovative agricultural practices will be assessed, aiming to mitigate the impacts
    of F contamination of water and soil on productivity of selected food and forage
    crops and dairy cattle health and production. The development of an innovative
    and shared Geo-data system will support the integrated, sustainable and participative
    management system. FLOWERED, focusing on innovative technologies and practices
    and taking into account local experiences, will implement an integrated water
    and agriculture management system and will enable local communities to manage
    water resources, starting from using efficient defluoridation techniques and applying
    sustainable agricultural practices. The integrated approaches improve knowledge
    for EU partners, local researchers, farmers and decision makers. The Project through
    the involvement of SMEs will strengthen the development co-innovative demonstration
    processes as well as new market opportunities.
