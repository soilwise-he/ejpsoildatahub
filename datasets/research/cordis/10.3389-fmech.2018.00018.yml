  title: The Role of Heat Transfer Limitations in Polymer Pyrolysis at the Microscale
  abstract: 'Smouldering megafires are the largest and longest-burning fires on Earth.
    They destroy essential peatland ecosystems, and are responsible for 15% of annual
    global greenhouse gas emissions. This is the same amount attributed to the whole
    of the European Union, and yet it is not accounted for in global carbon budgets.
    Peat fires also induce surges of respiratory emergencies in the population and
    disrupt shipping and aviation routes for long periods, weeks even months. The
    ambition of HAZE is to advance the science and create the technology that will
    reduce the burden of smouldering fires. Despite their importance, we do not understand
    how smouldering fires ignite, spread or extinguish, which impedes the development
    of any successful mitigation strategy. Megafires are routinely fought across the
    globe with techniques that were developed for flaming fires, and are thus ineffective
    for smouldering. Moreover, the burning of deep peat affects older soil carbon
    that has not been part of the active carbon cycle for centuries to millennia,
    and thus creates a positive feedback to the climate system. HAZE wants to turn
    the challenges faced by smouldering research into opportunities and has the following
    three novel aims; 1) To conduct controlled laboratory experiments and discover
    how peat fires ignite, spread and extinguish.2) To develop multidimensional computational
    models for the field scale (~1 km) and simulate the real phenomena.3) To create
    pathways for novel mitigation technologies in accurate prevention, quick detection
    systems, and simulation-driven suppression strategies.With my proposal, Europe
    has the chance to lead the way and pioneer technologies against this Earth-scale
    and important but unconventional source of emissions. I am confident that with
    the support of ERC, I can deliver the science and excellence needed to tackle
    this global challenge, and in doing so, I will advance the knowledge frontier,
    foster innovation and develop new young talent for Europe
