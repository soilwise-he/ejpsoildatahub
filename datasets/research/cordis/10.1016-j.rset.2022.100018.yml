  title: The Ethiopian energy sector and its implications for the SDGs and modeling
  abstract: "Energy is key for economic development. Especially in the era of sustainable\
    \ development, the source, the type, and the mix of energy are as important as\
    \ access to energy. This is particularly important in least developed countries\
    \ (LDCs) such as Ethiopia which heavily relies on traditional biomass energy sources.\
    \ Barely a quarter of total households in Ethiopia use electricity as a source\
    \ of light in their houses while 96% of the households depend on biomass for cooking\
    \ fuel. This in turn contributes to indoor air pollution which causes more than\
    \ 50,000 deaths annually and nearly 5% of the burden of disease in the country.\
    \ Besides, the sources of electricity are least diversified. About 95% of electricity\
    \ comes from hydro-power with thermal, geothermal, and wind sources contributing\
    \ the rest. Yet, the country regards hydro-power electricity as one of its potential\
    \ export item. For instance, in the year 2017/2018, electricity contributed to\
    \ 3% of the total merchandise export earnings. On the other hand, however, petroleum\
    \ products make up to 10-14% of the country\u2019s spending on imports. As such,\
    \ in Ethiopia, investment in energy transition has many implications for the economy\
    \ (e.g. on total factor productivity, structural change, trade balance), the environment\
    \ (e.g. deforestation and soil fertility), and human health (e.g. indoor air pollution).\
    \ In light of this, the use of scientific studies on the energy-economy-environment\
    \ inter-linkages will be paramount. However, the research in this subject is yet\
    \ nascent in Ethiopia. The existing literature overwhelmingly focuses on the supply\
    \ side of a specific energy source barely touching the interaction among energy\
    \ sources, the interaction of energy with environment and economy, and the demand\
    \ side. This project primarily intends to fill these appealing gaps, and examine\
    \ the environment-energy-economy inter-linkages in Ethiopia using partial equilibrium\
    \ energy model and an economy-wide general equilibrium model.\n"
