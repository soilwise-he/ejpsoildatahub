  title: 'Struvite production from dairy processing wastewater: Optimizing reaction
    conditions and effects of foreign ions through multi-response experimental models'
  abstract: 'REFLOW is an interdisciplinary cross-sectoral European Training Network
    combining world-leading scientists and key stake-holders in dairy processing,
    fertilizer production and phosphorous recycling with early stage researchers to
    address important technical and socio-economic challenges associated with the
    recovery of phosphorous from dairy processing waste water and its recycling into
    fertilizer products enabling sustainable expansion of the dairy industry in Europe.
    REFLOW research will (i) mitigate the environmental impact of dairy processing
    waste on soil and water, (ii) provide safe environmentally sustainable, cost effective
    closed loop solutions for crop nutrient management (iii) meet the demand for skilled
    professionals to support the technical, regulatory and commercial development
    of the market for recycled phosphorous fertilizer products in accordance with
    the deliverables of the Circular Economy Package. REFLOW will achieve these goals
    by creating an innovative and entrepreneurial training environment for the next
    generation of scientists. 13 ESRs will be recruited in a network of 10 beneficiaries
    and 14 partner organisations who bring complementary expertise and experience
    of delivering technical solutions, socio-economic modeling, environmental analysis,
    policy frameworks, high level training and commercial entrepreneurship. Graduating
    fellows will be equipped with a unique range of relevant interdisciplinary and
    cross-sectoral skills for careers as independent industrial or academic researchers,
    entrepreneurs, regulators or agri-environmental specialists. REFLOW will train
    the Fellows through an integrated and cohesive curriculum of network-wide partner
    training activities including industrial secondments and embedded commercially
    driven research projects. The outputs from REFLOW will influence land management
    practice, the rural bio-economy framework and EU policy goals while significantly
    progressing the state-of-the-art in Phosphorous recycling.
