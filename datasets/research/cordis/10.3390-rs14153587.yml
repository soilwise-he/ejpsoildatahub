  title: 'Tectono-Geomorphic Analysis in Low Relief, Low Tectonic Activity Areas:
    Case Study of the Temiskaming Region in the Western Quebec Seismic Zone (WQSZ),
    Eastern Canada'
  abstract: 'Soil spreading is an extensional creeping movement occurring along a
    shear surface and caused by liquefaction of a gliding plane. Spreading has been
    documented at many sites worldwide, and it represents an hazard for subaqueous
    and land infrastructures. Geological factors influencing the mechanics of spreading
    and its development have not been extensively explored. This proposal focuses
    on characterising the subaqueous spreading and investigating its triggers and
    development mechanisms, with the final purpose of testing the use of the spreading
    signature as a new proxy for paleoseismic research. The methodology will involve
    a comprehensive analysis of published data on on-land and subaqueous spreading,
    gathered in two databases respectively. This information will support the development
    of a 2D Finite Element model implemented on the Tuaheni slide complex (North Island
    of New Zealand). The final part of the project will investigate the role of spreading
    as a new proxy for supporting palaeoseismic analysis in the subaqueous setting.
    Spreading signature will be investigated in the stratigraphic and bathymetric
    record of Lake Tekapo (South Island of New Zealand). Results from this research
    will be significant to the European community, as they will be exploited to improve
    the understanding of spreading along the giant Storegga Slide on the Norwegian
    margin, and in relation to the on-going palaeoseismic research on Alpine Lakes.
    The beneficiary of this funding would be the University of Malta, whereas GEOMAR
    (Germany) and NIWA (New Zealand) will be partner organizations. This funding represents
    an ideal opportunity for the fellow allowing her to transfer the knowledge on
    land liquefaction and palaeoseismology to the subaqueous setting. Through this
    project the fellow will learn about subaqueous geophysical interpretation (bathymetry,
    2D and 3D seismic reflection), geomorphometry and finite element analysis, and
    to return to Europe to undertake high impact research.
