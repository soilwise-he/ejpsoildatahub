  title: Influence of Mineral Composition on Sintering Lunar Regolith
  abstract: "Future human activity on the lunar surface will use 3D printing to build\
    \ infrastructure from lunar soil using the Sun as the only source of energy. Today\
    \ this technology is considered disruptive; tomorrow it will be the standard.\
    \ The RegoLight project will investigate the sintering process of lunar regolith\
    \ simulants by means of concentrated sun light in order to prepare for future\
    \ lunar missions for building infrastructure (leveled terrain, dust shelters,\
    \ launch pads etc.) and structural components for lunar habitats.Solar sintering\
    \ of regolith is currently at TRL3 , being able to build a regolith \u2018brick\u2019\
    \ in a laboratory set-up with a moving table in a solar furnace. RegoLight aims\
    \ at enhancing this specific additive layer manufacturing technique \u2013which\
    \ seems very promising for lunar applications since it does not involve any consumables\u2013\
    \ by further characterizing the parameters for sintering different types of regolith\
    \ and by developing a movable printing head capable both of pointing the concentrated\
    \ solar beam at the required spot and of deploying incrementally additional layers\
    \ of regolith in order to continue with the additive building process.Based on\
    \ the mechanical properties of solar sintered regolith architectural scenarios\
    \ and applications will be developed, taking into account the benefits of additive\
    \ layer manufacturing and novel construction concepts for lunar gravity. This\
    \ detailed Finite Element Modeling will provide a first insight into lunar architectural\
    \ scenarios using this technology; With a concurrent engineering approach sample\
    \ structures will be printed having been derived from \u2018big picture\u2019\
    \ scenarios and bottom up approaches at the same time.The project objective is\
    \ the development of a regolith solar sintering device breadboard which will be\
    \ validated in a relevant environment (TRL5). The parts printed in a thermal vacuum\
    \ chamber will undergo mechanical properties tests to build a database and FEM\
    \ analysis for validation of the concepts.\n"
