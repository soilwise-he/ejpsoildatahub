  title: Multiscale Coupling Strategy for Nano Ecotoxicology Prediction
  abstract: "Concept; NanoFASE will deliver an integrated Exposure Assessment Framework,\
    \ including methods, parameter values, model and guidance that will allow Industry\
    \ to assess the full diversity of industrial nano-enabled products to a standard\
    \ acceptable in regulatory registrations. Methods to assess how use phases, waste\
    \ streams and environmental compartments (air, soil, water biota) act as \u201C\
    reactors\u201D in modifying and transporting ENMs will be developed and used to\
    \ derive parameter values. Our nanospecific models will be integrated with the\
    \ existing multi-media fate model SimpleBox4Nano for use in EUSES and also develop\
    \ into a flexible multi-media model for risk assessment at different scales and\
    \ complexities. Information on release form, transformation and transport processes\
    \ for product relevant ENMs will allow grouping into Functional Fate Groups according\
    \ to their \u201Cmost probable\u201D fate pathways as a contribution to safe-by-design\
    \ based on fate.Methodology; Inventories of material release forms along the product\
    \ value chain are established. We then study how released ENMs transform from\
    \ initial reactive states to modified forms with lower energy states in which\
    \ nanospecific properties may be lost. Transport studies assess material fluxes\
    \ within/between compartments. The experimental work underpins models describing\
    \ ENM transformation and transport. Open access is provided to the models suitable\
    \ for incorporation into existing exposure assessment tools (e.g. SimpleBox4Nano)\
    \ and for more detailed assessment. Framework completeness is validated by case\
    \ studies.Impact; Identified links between ENM material properties and fate outcome\
    \ (e.g. safe-by-design). Improved representation of nanospecific processes in\
    \ existing key fate and exposure assessment tools (e.g. SimpleBox4Nano in EUSES).\
    \ Contribution to standardization. GIS framework to support predictive assessment,\
    \ catchment and point source management of ENM releases.\n"
