  title: "Current state of the global operational aerosol multi\u2010model ensemble:\
    \ An update from the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP)"
  abstract: "Soil dust aerosols are mixtures of different minerals, whose relative\
    \ abundances, particle size distribution (PSD), shape, surface topography and\
    \ mixing state influence their effect upon climate. However, Earth System Models\
    \ typically assume that dust aerosols have a globally uniform composition, neglecting\
    \ the known regional variations in the mineralogy of the sources. The goal of\
    \ FRAGMENT is to understand and constrain the global mineralogical composition\
    \ of dust along with its effects upon climate. The representation of the global\
    \ dust mineralogy is hindered by our limited knowledge of the global soil mineral\
    \ content and our incomplete understanding of the emitted dust PSD in terms of\
    \ its constituent minerals that results from the fragmentation of soil aggregates\
    \ during wind erosion. The emitted PSD affects the duration of particle transport\
    \ and thus each mineral\u2019s global distribution, along with its specific effect\
    \ upon climate. Coincident observations of the emitted dust and soil PSD are scarce\
    \ and do not characterize the mineralogy. In addition, the existing theoretical\
    \ paradigms disagree fundamentally on multiple aspects. We will contribute new\
    \ fundamental understanding of the size-resolved mineralogy of dust at emission\
    \ and its relationship with the parent soil, based on an unprecedented ensemble\
    \ of measurement campaigns that have been designed to thoroughly test our theoretical\
    \ hypotheses. To improve knowledge of the global soil mineral content, we will\
    \ evaluate and use available remote hyperspectral imaging, which is unprecedented\
    \ in the context of dust modelling. Our new methods will anticipate the coming\
    \ innovation of retrieving soil mineralogy through high-quality spaceborne hyperspectral\
    \ measurements. Finally, we will generate integrated and quantitative knowledge\
    \ of the role of dust mineralogy in dust-radiation, dust-chemistry and dust-cloud\
    \ interactions based on modeling experiments constrained with our theoretical\
    \ innovations and field measurements.\n"
