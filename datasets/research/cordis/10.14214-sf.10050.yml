  abstract: "EFFORTE draws a red line through critical, cost/benefit driving processes,\
    \ and environmentally concerns of today\xB4s forestry. Starting with efficient\
    \ fulfilment of various customer demands the red line goes along efficient utilization\
    \ of Big Data sources, present knowledge and critical new knowledge foreseen as\
    \ outcomes from this project.Technical development and mechanization has been\
    \ a winning concept for high productivity now emphasizing more gentle methods\
    \ and just in time deliveries to different industry customers. This is possible\
    \ to reach if new knowledge, improved methods and technical development are combined\
    \ with better transfer of information and data from different sources (e.g processes,\
    \ geo data from LiDAR scanning, other conditions such as weather data etc).These\
    \ Big Data sources have been available for some years, but it is not until recently\
    \ that hardware, data communication and merging possibilities enable full potential\
    \ for a revolution of new applications. In the EFFORTE proposal we have identified\
    \ three main subjects that have specific importance for efficiency, productivity\
    \ and environmental concern in forest practice. Two of these implies to increasing\
    \ crucial knowledge and the third, Big Data applications, combines the new knowledge\
    \ with high resolution information sources into practice increasing efficiency\
    \ in forest management and the connected value chains. The main objectives of\
    \ EFFORTE are; i) To develop scientifically firm and techno-economically feasible\
    \ methodology to predict trafficability prior to forest operations. ii) To increase\
    \ forest growth and productivity of tree planting and young stand management iii)\
    \ To develop, customize and pilot modern \u2018Big data\u2019 solutions that will\
    \ increase productivity and decrease negative environmental impact (e.g. soil,\
    \ water and reduced fuel consumption). By EFFORTE we expect to make difference\
    \ in efficiency, productivity and sustainability for a growing Bio-based economy\
    \ in Europe.\n"
