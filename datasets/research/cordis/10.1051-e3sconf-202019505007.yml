  title: Benefits and drawbacks of applied direct currents for soil improvement via
    carbonate mineralization
  abstract: "Given the increasing scarcity of suitable land for development, soil\
    \ strengthening technologies have emerged in the past decade and go hand-in-hand\
    \ with the implementation of the majority of foundation solutions. The goal is\
    \ to alter the soil structure and its mechanical properties for ultimately securing\
    \ the integrity of structures. The BIOGEOS project puts the focus on bio-mediated\
    \ soil improvement, which falls within the broader framework of multi-physical\
    \ processes in geo-mechanics. The goal of the project is to engineer a novel,\
    \ natural material under controlled processes, for ultimately providing solutions\
    \ to real problems in the geo-engineering and geo-energy fields by advancing knowledge\
    \ around complex multi-physical phenomena in porous media. The bio-cemented geo-material,\
    \ which is produced by carefully integrating the metabolic activity of native\
    \ soil bacteria, is produced through the bio-mineralization of calcite bonds,\
    \ which act as natural cementation for endowing the subsurface with real cohesion\
    \ and increased resistance. A principal characteristic of the project is its multi-scale\
    \ approach through advanced experimentation to identify the main physical mechanisms\
    \ involved in the formation of the bio-mineralized bonds and their behaviour under\
    \ mechanical loading. The development of such a bio-mediated technology will lead\
    \ to innovative applications in a series of engineering problems such as the restoration\
    \ of weak foundations, seismic retrofitting, erosion protection, and the enhancement\
    \ of heat transfer in thermo-active geo-structures. The project foresees to adopt\
    \ multiple loading conditions for its laboratory characterization and ultimately\
    \ pass to the large experimental scale. BIOGEOS further aims to provide new knowledge\
    \ around the way we perceive materials in relation with their micro-structure\
    \ by implementing state-of-the-art inspection of the material\u2019s structure\
    \ in 3D space and subsequent prediction of their behaviour through numerical tools.\n"
