  title: Chromosome-scale assembly of the yellow mealworm genome
  abstract: "The world faces a major challenge with the sharp increase in demand for\
    \ meat and fish by 2050, to which current modes of production, whether through\
    \ agriculture, aquaculture or fisheries, cannot be sustained. An innovative solution\
    \ to this predicted shortage of resources, especially protein, lies in insect\
    \ production and processing which can provide a serious response, but to date\
    \ no industrial scale of production of insect-derived products has been reached.\
    \ The FARMYNG project has this ambition to develop on an industrial and automated\
    \ scale the breeding andtransformation of insects for the production of animal\
    \ nutrition, with the strong participation of 20 key actors all along the value\
    \ chain from the feedstock supply to the final insect transformation.FARMYNG will\
    \ demonstrate a large-scale, first-of-its-kind bio-based value chain producing\
    \ sustainable, safe and premium feed products from an innovative origin; the Tenebrio\
    \ molitor insect (mealworm). The plant developed for FARMYNG will use the efficiency\
    \ of mealworm physiology to convert vegetal by-products in mealworm biomass and\
    \ transform those mealworms into sustainable proteins and lipids for fish feed\
    \ and pet food end markets. In parallel, manure will be recovered for soil fertilization\
    \ applications. Insects are indeed very effective at converting organic matter.\
    \ Fed with no-noble materials, insects multiply quickly, and are a rich and natural\
    \ source of food for certain livestock and pet animals, and probably ultimately\
    \ for the Humans directly. Insects also emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia\
    \ and use less water and land than other animal proteins value chains. FARMYNG\
    \ project, responding to the increasing worldwide proteins demand, will transfer\
    \ the technology from a demo plant to the Industrial Flagship Plant able to produce\
    \ almost 1 500 tons of proteins and 400 tons of oil per month, reaching a productions\
    \ rate never demonstrated before for insect\u2019s proteins production plant.\n"
