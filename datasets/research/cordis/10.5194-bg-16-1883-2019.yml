    \ seasonal root dynamics"
  abstract: 'Mr.PARTS investigates plant belowground carbon investment and the timing
    of root development . Root turnover is an important part of global carbon (C)
    cycles and plants may alter investment into root systems due to nutrient imbalances
    or droughts as well as under anthropogenic global change.  However, soils  are
    difficult to study and root biomass is highly spatially and temporally variable,
    especially as seasonal timing (phenology) of aboveground plant events may affect
    resource investment and growth periods belowground.  I focus on advancing specially
    designed camera systems for belowground observatories (minirhizotrons; MR) for
    non-destructive root/soil system observation and repeatable quantification of
    root biomass, life/death status and traits, using frequent automated data collection
    and automatic data processing. I will develop new MR instruments and deploy them
    first in  a greenhouse-based mesocosm at the host institution in a controlled
    and well monitored setting, then a transfer to the field in a thoroughly instrumented
    (e.g. multiple height eddy covariance CO2, above-ground phenology cameras, soil
    lysimeters) study site as part of  an ecosystem-scale experiment manipulating
    nutrient stoichiometry in a seasonally dry savanna in Spain.  Data streams from
    the MR instruments will be processed by machine learning techniques and compared
    and calibrated against manual measurements of root biomass and root traits made
    via conventional destructive soil coring as well as whole system above-ground
    phenology, water and carbon budgets, to identify links between above- and belowground
    phenology as well as root control over ecosystem C fluxes. In addition, a paired
    13C isotope labelling experiment will investigate C partitioning to non- root
    biomass building pools (e.g. root exudates, mycorrhizal fungi, maintenance respiration)
    to produce an integrated budget of plant belowground C investment and the controls
    on root production.
