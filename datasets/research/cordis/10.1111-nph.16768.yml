  title: "Phylogenetic signals and predictability in plant\u2013soil feedbacks"
  abstract: 'Predicting which alien plant species will become invasive is key to mitigating
    their impact. Plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) between plant species and soil microbes
    are crucial for controlling plant abundance. It has been suggested that positive
    PSF could promote alien plant invasion but that negative PSF could help their
    control. However, a framework to predict which alien species will experience positive
    feedback, and under what conditions, is lacking. My project will combine fundamental
    ecological theory, state-of-the-art knowledge of PSF, carefully designed experiments,
    and cutting-edge techniques in data analysis and high-throughput sequencing to
    gain a predictive understanding of the role of PSF in plant invasion. I will test
    the novel hypothesis that close relatedness between alien and native plant species
    will promote invasion when nutrients are limiting by allowing alien plants to
    integrate into native soil mutualistic networks, but prevent invasion under high
    nutrient conditions by increasing the susceptibility of alien plants to native
    soil pathogens. For alien and native plant species that vary in relatedness I
    will; 1) quantify the strength of PSF under differing nutrient conditions; 2)
    characterise mutualistic associations in the roots; and 3) characterise the soil
    microbial communities they cultivate. Moreover, I will develop an open access
    database of collated PSF data to facilitate further global collaborations. Results
    will reveal how native plant communities and their local environment influence
    alien plant invasions. They will lay the foundation for important applied research
    on the impact of plant invasions on native PSF, and how PSF knowledge might be
    used in ecosystem restoration worldwide. By targeting EU Regulation 1143/2014
    on Invasive Alien Species and Goal 15 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals,
    this research will contribute to applied outcomes for the EU and substantially
    raise my research profile within Europe and internationally.
