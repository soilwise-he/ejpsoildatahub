  title: Using Thermogravimetry as a Simple Tool for Nutrient Assessment in Fire Affected
    Soils
  abstract: "Wildfires remove protective vegetation, leaving the landscapes vulnerable\
    \ to catastrophic erosion, landslides and floods. The resulting losses and mitigation\
    \ costs following wildfires have increased dramatically in the last 30 years due\
    \ to (i) the population increase, (ii) the rise in fire severity and torrential\
    \ rains associated with climatic change, and (iii) critical gaps in and limited\
    \ transfer of knowledge on fire-effects to support decision making. Major advances\
    \ have been made in the last decade including the development of cost-risk erosion\
    \ prediction tools, innovative hillslope stabilization treatments and novel approaches\
    \ to monitor soil redistribution. In Europe, however, their application in post-fire\
    \ prevention plans is still in its infancy as the necessary soil-specific calibration\
    \ and effectiveness testing is missing for most terrain types.  In this project\
    \ I aim to exploit my expertise in Andisols to address this important research\
    \ and management gap for volcanic regions. These terrains are not only typically\
    \ very steep, densely populated and highly prone to wildfires, but as they experience\
    \ some of the most torrential rainfall events worldwide, they are very often subjected\
    \ to the dramatic consequences of floods, severe water erosion and landslides,\
    \ which threaten properties and human lives. I propose to use an innovative field,\
    \ laboratory and modelling approach and carefully chosen implementation programme,\
    \ involving the validation and application of novel erosion-risk tools. Where\
    \ applied, these tools will reduce risks to lives and properties, for southern\
    \ European countries, savings of over \u20AC375 million per year can be expected.\
    \ The collaborative work plan, involving global leaders in academia, industry\
    \ and management, not only provides me with multidisciplinary and inter-sectorial\
    \ training of the highest standard. It also ensures the application of the best\
    \ science and effective knowledge transfer from academia to the end-users.\n"
