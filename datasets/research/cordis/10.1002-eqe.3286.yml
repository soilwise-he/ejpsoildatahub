  abstract: 'The key concept and vision of RISE is to promote a paradigm shift in
    how earthquake risk is perceived and managed. We believe that by taking advantage
    of advances in scientific understanding, and dramatically changing technological
    capabilities, earthquake hazard and risk will soon be appreciated not as a constant
    in time, but as an evolving, integrated and dynamic risk. In our concept, dynamic
    risk depends on location, changing with soil conditions, topography, structural
    type, occupancy and use and even location within a structure. However, dynamic
    risk also includes changes with time, for example increasing when a seismic sequence
    is active nearby and due to an improved dynamic geophysical understanding of faulting
    and earthquake processes. RISE proposes a series of coordinated activities in
    the domains of Operational Earthquake Forecasting, Earthquake Early Warning, Rapid
    Loss Assessment and Recovery and Rebuilding Efforts. Our approach is multi-disciplinary,
    involving earth-scientists, engineering-scientists, computer scientists, and social
    scientists. It is multi-scale in space and time, and addresses these scales in
    a highly systemic and consistent way. RISE joins with EPOS Integrated Core Service
    and several of the Thematic Core Services (TCS), with ARISTOTLE and the Copernicus
    Emergency Management Service. Integration will also include responsible national
    agencies in Italy, Turkey, Iceland, Israel and Switzerland and with selected industry
    partners. To maximise the impact of RISE, we have assembled an interdisciplinary
    team of truly outstanding researchers and practitioners, 37 PIs from 24 institutions
    (including 5 contributing partners from outside of Europe), in 13 countries, with
    documented experience on the topics of the project developed in previous FP6,
    FP7, and H2020 projects.
