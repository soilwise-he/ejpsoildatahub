  title: 'The physical structure of soil: Determinant and consequence of trophic interactions'
  abstract: "Rationale; Soils are precious for human health and food production but\
    \ 33 % of the world soils are degraded. Developing ecological engineering strategies\
    \ to restore them is an urgent need. Soil structure is a key aspect of soil functioning,\
    \ with soil aggregates being organo-mineral associations, constituting its building\
    \ bricks. The influence of soil organisms on soil aggregation is commonly acknowledged\
    \ but supported by little direct mechanistic evidence, which are mainly single\
    \ group approaches, hence not depicting the role of the complex soil biota.Aim;\
    \ The aim of this MSC project is to directly link the soil food web properties\
    \ to the formation of soil aggregates, with subsequent consequences on the restoration\
    \ of soil functioning. The novelty of this project is that it will provide direct\
    \ mechanistic evidence of how species interactions \u2013 and not only diversity\
    \ \u2013 can influence a key soil process; the formation of aggregates. The resulting\
    \ knowledge will provide basis for developing soil ecological engineering techniques\
    \ to restore degraded soil via soil biota manipulation. Methodology; Unravelling\
    \ such mechanistic understanding will require a multidisciplinary approach merging\
    \ soil animal ecology and soil physics. The project will be hosted by the University\
    \ of G\xF6ttingen in Germany, providing unique access to soil ecology and physics\
    \ lab facilities. Two experiments, respectively manipulating targeted trophic\
    \ interactions (bacteria-amoebe and fungi-collembola) and natural soil food web\
    \ complexity (tracked by isotope tracing, PLFA, etc.) will be run in microcosms\
    \ and mesocosms, and resulting changes in soil aggregate properties and soil functioning\
    \ will be assessed by cutting edge physics techniques, such as neutron radiography\
    \ and X-rays tomography. A secondment period in the Freie University of Berlin\
    \ will allow the fellow to reach a functional understanding of the effect of soil\
    \ biota on aggregation through the measurement of soil organismal traits.\n"
