  abstract: 'Increasing chemical pollution seriously compromises the health of ecosystems
    and humans worldwide. Hazardous compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
    heavy metals and emerging pollutants contaminate soils/sediments, ground and surface
    waters. To prevent/minimise the risks associated with the accumulations of these
    chemicals in the environment it is key to establish low-cost/green methodologies
    for the treatment and redevelopment of contaminated areas. Several physico-chemical
    methods have been explored to remove pollutants in the environment, but these
    are complex, energy consuming or expensive. The exploitation of the capability
    of bacteria, fungi and phototrophs to transform toxic contaminants into harmless
    end-products, can lead instead to cheap and sustainable bioremediation alternatives.GREENER
    proposes the development of innovative, efficient and low-cost hybrid solutions
    that integrate bioremediation technologies with bio-electrochemical systems (BES).
    BES, such as microbial fuel cells, break down organic contaminants through the
    action of electroactive bacteria while generating electrical current. We will
    investigate the synergetic effect of different bioremediation strategies and demonstrate
    effective pollutants removal in water and soil/sediments, while generating side
    products of interest, such as bioelectricity. The type and entity of contamination,
    along with the specific physico-chemical/microbial characteristics of the environment
    to be depolluted, will feed into a decision-making toolbox. The latter will allow
    the establishment of ad hoc integrated solutions, which will take into account
    effectiveness of biodegradation, costs, environmental risks and social aspects.
    Fundamental research will be performed at lab-scale, while pilot-tests will be
    used to proof the scaling-up feasibility for field applications. Environmental
    benefits and risks, compared to standard remediation approaches, including energy
    efficiency, will be investigated.
