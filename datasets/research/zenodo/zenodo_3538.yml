  title: Effect Of Waste Bottle Chips On Strength Parameters Of Silty Soil
  abstract: Laboratory consolidated undrained triaxial (CU) tests were carried out
    to study the strength behavior of silty soil reinforced with randomly plastic
    waste bottle chips. Specimens mixed with plastic waste chips in triaxial compression
    tests with 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25% by dry weight of soil and tree different
    length including 4, 8, and 12 mm. In all of the samples, the width and thickness
    of plastic chips were kept constant. According to the results, the amount and
    size of plastic waste bottle chips played an important role in the increasing
    of the strength parameters of reinforced silt compared to the pure soil. Because
    of good results, the suggested method of soil improvement can be used in many
    engineering problems such as increasing the bearing capacity and settlement reduction
    in foundations.
