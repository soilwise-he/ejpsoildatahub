  title: "Dynamics Of The Quantity Of Agronomically Valuable Groups Of Microorganisms\
    \ During Cultivation Of Maize On Sod\u2013Podzolic Light\u2013Clay Soil"
  abstract: "The paper considers the effect of biofertilizers (PolyFunKur and Agromik)\
    \ on agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms in order to determine their\
    \ quantity depending on the phenol phases of maize.\n\nMethods: phenological,\
    \ agrochemical, microbiological.\n\nStudies were carried out on sod\u2013podzolic\
    \ light\u2013clay soil. The studies of the quantity of agronomically valuable\
    \ groups of microorganisms with PolyFunKur in the tillering phase revealed that\
    \ eight of nine groups had increased their quantity from 0.3 to 1.8 times over\
    \ the control; only cellulose\u2013destroying aerobic microorganisms had decreased\
    \ their quantity in 3.5 times under the control. Most of the groups of microorganisms\
    \ increased their quantity over the control in case of Agromik as well. The total\
    \ amount of microorganisms assimilating mineral nitrogen was almost equal in both\
    \ tests. As in the tillering phase, in the beginning of flowering phase, eight\
    \ of nine groups had increased their quantity over the control in case PolyFunKur\
    \ test. In the case of Agromik, the quantity of micromycetes and spore ammonifiers\
    \ in the control was higher while the quantity of cellulose\u2013destroying aerobic\
    \ bacteria was almost the same in the tillering phase; and was higher by more\
    \ than 27 times than in PolyFunKur test in the beginning of the flowering phase.\
    \ The quantity of all the studied agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms\
    \ in PolyFunKur test was higher than in the control and in the Agromik test in\
    \ the cob-forming phase."
