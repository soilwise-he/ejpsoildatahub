  title: "Prediction of the Transported Soil Volume by the Presence of Water in the\
    \ Vicinity of Ma\u2019adim Vallis (Mars)"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abstract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ma''adim Vallis is a channel that ends at the Gusev Crater.
    In general terms, the length of the channel is about 700 km while its width can
    reach 20 km and its depth 2 km. Currently, the images obtained from the area allow
    to visualize a landscape of abundant gullies with important signs of water erosion.
    In order to predict the volume of transported soil by the presence of water in
    the vicinity of Ma''adim Vallis, as well as to generate a rainfall model applicable
    to the red planet, a total of 16 cross-sectional profiles were made along the
    main canyon, ensuring that all were equidistant from each other depending on the
    orographic characteristics of the study area. Once the volume of transported soil
    was obtained, a novel model capable of predicting the rainfall concentration index
    (RCI) necessary to produce a certain water erosion on the Mars surface was obtained.
    This model is applicable to other rocky planets as a result of its simplicity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
