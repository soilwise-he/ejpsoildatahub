  title: YIELD OF SEVERAL PAPER CHILI (CAPSICUM ANNUM L.) VARIETIES AS THE EFFECT
    BY APPLICATION OF MYCORRHIZA IN SALINE SOIL.
  abstract: Saline land is widely found in tidal areas or around the coast, saline
    soils are a limiting factor for people to manage economical valuable hoticultural
    crops such as paper chili, paper chili contains nutrients needed for health. Paper
    chili contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamins,
    and alkaloid compounds, such as capsaicin, flavenoid, and essential oils. The
    purpose of this study was to determine the effect of paper chili varieties and
    mycorrhiza types and the interactions between these two factors on the growth
    and yield of paper chilli plants on saline soil. The type Arbuscularmycorrhiza
    (AMF) used were; Glomus sp., Acaulospora and mixture, mean while several types
    of chili varieties namely Perintis, PM 999 and Lado on saline soil. The research
    was conducted at the Experimental Farm, Plant Disease Laboratory and Soil Biology
    Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Syiah Kuala University, Darussalam, Banda
    Aceh. It was held from August to November 2018. The design used in this experiment
    was a 4 ? 3 Factorial Randomized Block Design with 3 replications, as the result
    there were 12 treatment combinations. The results of this study indicate that,
    varieties have a very significant effect on the number of fruit crops significantly
    affect the weight of fruit crops. The type of mycorrhiza had a very significant
    effect on the number of fruit crops, and had no significant effect on the weight
    of the fruit of the crop, the weight of the wet crop, the dry weight of the crop,
    the wet weight of the root crop, the dry weight of the root crop, the root length
    of the crop. The use of mycorrhizae and varieties in saline soils can increase
    plant growth and yield and increase the weight of chili fruit supported by the
    input of the soil.
