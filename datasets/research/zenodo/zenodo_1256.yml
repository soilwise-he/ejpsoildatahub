  title: Addition of Vermicompost to Soil Influences Total Phenolic Content of Sweet
    Basil
  abstract: Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), a medicinal and aromatic plant possesing
    rich phenolic and terpenoid content, is commonly utilized for culinary and medicinal
    purposes around the world sinceancient times. Vermicompost (VC) products were
    categorized as biostimulants along with the humic exracts andare utilized for
    organic fertilizer as well asconsidered as an organic soil amendment material.Use
    oforganic fertilizers preserves the essential oil yield and natural aroma of basil.
    In present study, the effect of increasing doses of vermicompost additions (0%,
    10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) on total phenolic content (TPC) inthe leaves of sweet
    basil were investigated. The highest TPC was determined at 10% VC applicated group
    as 90,02 mg/g leaf and the lowest TPC was determined at 30% VC applicated group
    as 50,72 mg/g leaf in dry weight expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). Plant
    biostimulants are de novo products and have proved efficiency in medicinal and
    aromatic plant cultivation due to their possible inducing activities on the synthesis
    of secondary metabolites.
