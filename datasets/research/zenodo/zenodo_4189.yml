  title: Gradations In Concentration Of Heavy And Mineral Elements With Distance And
    Depth Of Soil In The Vicinity Of Auto Mechanic Workshops In Sabon Gari, Kaduna
    State, Nigeria
  abstract: 'The concentration levels of six heavy metals (Cd, Cr,<br>

    Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn) and two mineral elements (Ca and Mg) were<br>

    determined in soil samples collected from the vicinity of two auto<br>

    mechanic workshops in Sabon-Gari, Kaduna state, Nigeria, using<br>

    Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), in order to compare the<br>

    gradation of their concentrations with distance and depth of soil from<br>

    the workshop sites. At site 1, concentrations of Lead, Chromium, Iron<br>

    and Zinc were generally found to be above the World Health<br>

    Organization limits, while those of Nickel and Cadmium fell within<br>

    the limits. Iron had the highest concentration with a range of 176.274<br>

    ppm to 489.127 ppm at depths of 5 cm to 15 cm and a distance range<br>

    of 5 m to 15 m, while the concentration of cadmium was least with a<br>

    range of 0.001 ppm to 0.008 ppm at similar depth and distance<br>

    ranges. In addition, there was more of calcium (11.521 ppm to<br>

    121.709 ppm), in all the samples, than magnesium (11.293 ppm to<br>

    21.635 ppm). Similar results were obtained for site II. The<br>

    concentrations of all the metals analyzed showed a downward<br>

    gradient with increase in depth and distance from both workshop sites<br>

    except for iron and zinc at site 2. The immediate and remote<br>

    implications of these findings on the biota are discussed.'
