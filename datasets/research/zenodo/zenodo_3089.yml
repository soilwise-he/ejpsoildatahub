  title: GENOTYPES X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION AND EFFECTS OF SOIL NUTRIENTS VARIABILITY
    ON RICE YIELD FOR IRRIGATED AND RAINFED ECOLOGIES IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA
  abstract: 'Twenty eight rice genotypes were evaluated in 10 sites under irrigated
    ecology and 3 sites under rainfed ecology of East and Southern Africa rice growing
    region to identify high yielding, stable rice genotypes and determine mega environment
    for adoption. This study established how soil nutrients factors affected yield.
    Genotypes were arranged in RCBD replicated site wise. Analysis of variance was
    used to determine mean yield while AMMI and GGE biplots were used to establish
    the effects of genotype x environment interaction on yields. Relationships between
    yield and soil nutrients elements were determined through correlation coefficient
    analysis. Combined analysis of variance showed the environment accounted for (76.9%),
    G (14.6%) and GE (4.6%) of the total variation for the irrigated ecology. Under
    rainfed ecology, environment accounted for 39%, followed by genotype (22.1%) and
    GE (20.4%). Predominant effect of the environment revealed environmental complexity
    on yield. Based on genotypes yields, the 10 sites of irrigated ecology were partitioned
    into three mega environments 1st (Cyabanga), 2nd (Ahero and Cylii), while Dakawa,
    Umbeluzi, Chokwe, Kibimba, Malawi and Bagamoyo clustered thirdly. Under rainfed
    conditions two mega environments were noted; (Mozambique & Lupembe) and Mucelo.
    The ''''who won where'''' pattern showed genotypes INTSINDAGIRA-BIGEGA as check
    bested performed in 1st mega-environment, IR 79511 was high in Cyabanga mega environment
    while IR77713, IR 03A262 & IR 09A136 yielded high in clustered mega-environment
    in irrigated ecology. In rainfed ecology, genotypes BKN/SUPA and Ediget won in
    1st megaenvironment whereas T6 (IR 77080) won in Mucelo mega-environment. From
    mean and stability GGE biplots, genotypes T10 (6740kg/ha) and T21 (6995Kg/ha)
    had the highest yield. Genotypes IR 77080, IR77713, IR79511 and IR 03A550 exhibited
    both high yields and stability under irrigated conditions. Under rainfed ecology
    T6 and IR 07A167 were ideal for stability and higher yields whereas (SUPA/BKN)
    recoding highest yield (4319kg/ha). Cyabanga and Cyili were found to be efficient
    test environments but Kibimba was more representative for irrigated ecology. Under
    rainfed ecology, Lupembe and Mucelo had discrimination ability and ideal for genotypes
    selection though Zanzibar was the most representative. The correlation of soil
    nutrient variables with rice yields ranged from (-0.27 Key words: Adaptation,
