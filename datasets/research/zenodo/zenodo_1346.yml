  title: GEOTECHNICAL PROPERTIES OF LATERITIC SOIL STABILIZED WITH CEMENT AND PULVERIZED
    WOOD CHARCOAL
  abstract: This study investigates the geotechnical properties of lateritic soil
    stabilized with pulverized wood charcoal (PWC) in comparison with the same soil
    stabilized with cement which is considered to be the best stabilizer. Classification
    of the soil according to AASHTO revealed that the soil is an A-6 soil. Chemical
    tests carried out on PWC and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) indicated that the
    major oxides present in the OPC sample were CaO and SiO<sub>2</sub> at 60.50%
    and 21.40% respectively and in the PWC were CaO and SiO<sub>2</sub> at 39.46%
    and 28.46% respectively. This distinctly high concentration of CaO is responsible
    for their high stabilizing property. Compaction, California Bearing Ratio (CBR)
    and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests carried out on the lateritic soil
    in its natural state and when PWC was added in varying proportions of 2, 4, 6,
    8 and 10% by weight of soil indicated that the stabilizer enhanced the strength
    of the lateritic soil. The unsoaked CBR value of the soil attained the optimum
    value of 13.68% on addition of 6% PWC by weight of soil. The unconfined compressive
    strength improved from 148.65kN/m<sup>2</sup> in the natural state to 296.6kN/m<sup>2</sup>
    at 10% PWC addition. Based on the geotechnical properties obtained, charcoal has
    a high potential of being a veritable soil stabilizer and compares favourably
    with cement in compressive strength.
