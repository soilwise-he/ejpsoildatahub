  title: "Assessment of soil erosion in the Autonomous District of Abidjan, C\xF4\
    te d'Ivoire"
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> In a context of global\
    \ changes and climatic uncertainties, this study poses the problem of the occurrence\
    \ of water erosion induced by natural constraints and uncontrolled and speculative\
    \ anthropisation of soils in the Autonomous District of Abidjan. The aim is to\
    \ propose a decision-making tool that identifies the areas of the Autonomous District\
    \ of Abidjan (ADA) most prone to soil loss and the risk of water erosion. More\
    \ specifically, the aim is to evaluate, prioritise and map the levels of susceptibility\
    \ to the occurrence of this hydroclimatic risk in the ADA. The mapping approach\
    \ is based on the aggregation of factors such as climatic aggressiveness, soil\
    \ erodibility, topography, soil cover and anti-erosion practices from the Revised\
    \ Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The exploitation of these data reveals\
    \ that soil loss in the ADA oscillates between a minimum value of 0 t/ha/year\
    \ largely observable in the south of the lagoon system to a maximum value of 107.53\
    \ t/ha/year which concerns the plateau areas in the north. The average of this\
    \ series of 0.48 t/ha/year translates into an overall low level of water erosion\
    \ in the ADA over nearly 95% of the ADA territory. This soil degradation, which\
    \ impacts human settlements induced by the morphology of the site, is amplified\
    \ by human activities. In a context of rapid urban expansion linked to a remarkable\
    \ demographic growth coupled with climatic uncertainties, development policies\
    \ must better integrate sustainable soil management."
