  title: An Experimental Study On Modification Of Geotechnical Properties Of Expansive
    Soil Through Inorganic Chemicals
  abstract: Construction of foundation and other civil engineering structures on weak
    or soft soil involves risk due to the susceptibility of high compressive and poor
    shear strength. In the constructions of   foundation on soft soils, the subsoil
    needs to have adequate bearing capacity and shear strength to prevent unnecessary
    differential settlements and shear failure of the substructure. If the bearing
    capacity and shear strength is insufficient, it can be increased by replacing
    good soil in place of bad soil, which involves high financial aspects or improve
    the properties of existing soil by ground improvement techniques. There are several
    techniques available to improve the soil properties. In this investigation, an
    attempt has been made to study the effect of the chemicals like Sodium Carbonate
    (Na2C03), Calcium Carbonate (CaC03), on the geotechnical properties of an expansive
    soil. 1.25% amount of Sodium Carbonate (Na2C03) and Calcium Carbonate (CaC03)
    is found effective in reducing the plasticity characteristics to a certain extent
    in the tested range when mixed with soil. The pH values of soil admixed with Sodium
    Carbonate (Na2C03) and Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) is also higher than that of the
    untreated soil.
