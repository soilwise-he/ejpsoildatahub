  title: Influence of Soil Moisture Regime on Iron and Manganese Release in Soil and
    on the Growth of Upland Rice
  abstract: This article 'Influence of Soil Moisture Regime on Iron and Manganese
    Release in Soil and on the Growth of Upland Rice' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
