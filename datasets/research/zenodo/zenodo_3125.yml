  title: Effect of Integrated Nutrient Management on Influence of Dry Matter Production
    and Post Harvest Soil Analysis in Ashgourd (Benincasa hispida cogn.) cv. CO-1
  abstract: "An investigation on effect of integrated nutrient management on post\
    \ harvest soil analysis in ashgourd (Benincasa hispida cogn.) cv. CO-1 was undertaken\
    \ at Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Annamalai University,\
    \ Annamalai Nagar during 2013-2014. The results of the study indicated that pr\xE9\
    cised application of various organic inputs with inorganic fertilizer had significant\
    \ influence of post harvest soil analysis. Application of FYM @ 10 kg pit-1 plus\
    \ 50 per cent RDF plus EM @ 1:1000 dilution significantly increased the post harvest\
    \ soil available nitrogen, post harvest soil available phosphorous and post harvest\
    \ soil available potassium in ashgourd.\_"
