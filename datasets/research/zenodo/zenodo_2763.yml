  title: "\uFEFFHydrological regime and forest development have indirect effects on\
    \ soil fauna feeding activity in Central European hardwood floodplain forests"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil fauna act as regulators of decomposition processes via
    their feeding activity, thereby playing an important role in regulating carbon
    cycling and sequestration. Hardwood floodplain forests are critically endangered
    habitats, but strongly contribute to carbon sequestration in Central Europe. In
    the present study, within a floodplain forest-development programme, we investigated
    the feeding activity of soil fauna via the Bait Lamina test in hardwood floodplain
    forests of the middle Elbe River in Germany in sites with different hydrological
    regimes and forest-development stages, with neighbouring grassland sites for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;While
    statistically significant differences in overall feeding activity between general
    hydrological regimes or forest development stages were not found, decreases in
    feeding activity with soil depth were strongly modulated by these factors, indicating
    more unfavourable conditions for soil fauna at increasing soil depth due to, e.g.,
    anoxic conditions in floodplains of tributaries or low soil moisture content below
    the shallow rooting zone of grasslands. Registered effects of soil texture on
    soil fauna feeding activity were dependent on forest-tree density, and combined
    effects indicate that soil-fauna feeding activity varies with soil temperature
    during spring, but with soil moisture in early autumn.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;In
    conclusion, our results highlight the importance of the current abiotic conditions
    on soil-fauna feeding activities in floodplain forests, i.e. soil temperature,
    moisture and ground water level. Hydrological regime and forest development have
    a strong impact on the effect of these conditions, indirectly affecting soil fauna
    feeding activity and highlighting the multifactorial influence on soil fauna functional
    activity to be considered in floodplain-forest restoration programs.&lt;/p&gt;'
