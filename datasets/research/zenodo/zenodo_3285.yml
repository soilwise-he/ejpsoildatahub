  title: Seismic Soil-Pile Interaction Considering Nonlinear Soil Column Behavior
    In Saturated And Dry Soil Conditions
  abstract: This paper investigates seismic soil-pile interaction using the Beam on
    Nonlinear Winkler Foundation (BNWF) approach. Three soil types are considered
    to cover all the possible responses, as well as nonlinear site response analysis
    using finite element method in OpenSees platform. Excitations at each elevation
    that are output of the site response analysis are used as the input excitation
    to the soil pile system implementing multi-support excitation method. Spectral
    intensities of acceleration show that the extent of the response in sand is more
    severe than that of clay, in addition, increasing the PGA of ground strong motion
    will affect the sandy soil more, in comparison with clayey medium, which is an
    indicator of the sensitivity of soil-pile systems in sandy soil.
