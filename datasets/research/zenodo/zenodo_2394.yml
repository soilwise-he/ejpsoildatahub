  title: A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FOR SOIL SALINITY PREDICTION IN THE GREAT HUNGARIAN
    PLAIN USING SENTINEL 2 DATA
  abstract: Salts occur naturally within soil and water. When exceeding the thresholds,
    salinity becomes a severe threat, damaging agricultural productivity, water and
    soil quality, biodiversity, and infrastructures. Multispectral data retrieved
    from Sentinel-2 MSI sensor were used in this study to predict soil salinity in
    the Great Hungarian Plain. For this purpose, samples were collected from the upper
    layer of soil between mid-September and mid-October in the Hungarian Soil Monitoring
    System framework. The application of multiple linear regression analysis between
    salt content (g/kg) and remotely sensed data revealed a highly moderate correlation
    with a coefficient of determination R<sup>2 </sup>equals 0.52, a p-value equals
    0.001198, and an RMSE equals 0.194 g/kg. The model can be employed to highlight
    soil salinity levels in the study area and understand the efficiency of land management
    strategies, considering its moderate predictive power.
