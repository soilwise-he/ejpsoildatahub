  title: EFFECTIVE USE OF BIG DATA FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE-BASED SOIL ANALYSIS AND
    CROP FERTILITY PREDICTION
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong> In today\u2019s era to handle the increasing\
    \ challenges of agricultural production, we need to understand the complex agricultural\
    \ ecosystems The usage of modern digital technologies can help in monitoring the\
    \ physical environment, help in predicting large volumes of data in an unprecedented\
    \ pace. By using (big) data we can extract the values from it and help the farmers\
    \ to yield productivity .Big data has been used in various industries, but not\
    \ yet used in agriculture sector. The main objective of this paper is to perform\
    \ a review on recent studies and research works in agriculture which employ the\
    \ current practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems.\
    \ Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address,\
    \ the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions\
    \ of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our\
    \ review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture\
    \ towards smarter farming, precision agriculture by showing that the availability\
    \ of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well\
    \ as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic\
    \ research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agriculture\
    \ sector."
