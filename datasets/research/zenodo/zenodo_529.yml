  title: A soil moisture algorithm using tilted Bragg approximation
  abstract: A successful soil moisture algorithm using radar data must identify the
    soil moisture effect and the surface roughness dependence explicitly since rough
    surface scattering depends on both the roughness and the dielectric constant of
    an imaged surface. For bare surfaces, several algorithms have been developed to
    estimate soil moisture using polarimetric radar data. These algorithms were empirically
    derived from either experimental data or numerical data instead of starting from
    rough surface scattering theories. In this paper, we present a soil moisture algorithm
    theoretically derived using the tilted Bragg approximation. With appropriate approximations
    using the tilted Bragg theory, we have derived both co- and cross-polarization
    ratios. Then, a soil moisture algorithm is developed based on these two ratios.
    This new algorithm is compared with the existing empirical methods using input
    data from the IEM (Integral Equation Method) an experimental radar data. We also
    briefly discuss the effect of vegetation on this soil moisture algorithm.
