  title: Impacts of Compost Application on Controlling Powdery Mildew of Dill (Anethum
    graveolens L.) Caused by Erysiphe heraclei and its Effect on Soil Fertility and
    Productivity
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Field experiments were carried out under natural infection in
    the Experimental Farm of Sids Agricultural Research Station, Agricultural Research
    Center, Beni-Sweif governorate in 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the efficiency of
    compost amended with rock phosphate, gypsum and inoculated by some bioagents (Bacillus
    subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) in controlling
    of powdery mildew on dill caused by Erysiphe heraclei and improving its productivity
    as well as soil fertility using two application methods: soil amendment and/or
    foliar spray. Overall, all the tested compost treatments were effective in reducing
    the disease incidence, severity and improve plant growth leading to a significant
    increase in fresh, dry weights and fruits yield, NPK uptake. Furthermore, all
    the tested treatments showed significant increases in the defence-related enzymes,
    peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and phenols in treated plants as compared with
    the untreated control. However, compost treatments improve some physical and chemical
    properties of the soil at the end of growing seasons and increase dehydrogenase
    activity as a result of enhancing soil fertility.&lt;/p&gt;'
