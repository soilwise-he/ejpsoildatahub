  title: An assessment of the meteoritic contribution to the Martian soil
  abstract: "The addition of meteoritic material to the Mars soils should perturb\
    \ their chemical compositions, as has been detected for soils on the Moon [Anders\
    \ et al., 1973] and sediments on Earth [Kyte and Wasson, 1986]. Using the measured\
    \ mass influx at Earth and estimates of the Mars/Earth flux ratio, we estimate\
    \ the continuous, planet\u2010wide meteoritic mass influx on Mars to be between\
    \ 2700 and 59,000 t/yr. If distributed uniformly into a soil with a mean planetary\
    \ production rate of 1 m/b.y., consistent with radar estimates of the soil depth\
    \ overlaying a bouldered terrain in the Tharsis region [Christensen, 1986], our\
    \ estimated mass influx would produce a meteoritic concentration in the Mars soil\
    \ ranging from 2 to 29% by mass. Analysis of the Viking X ray fluorescence data\
    \ indicates that the Mars soil composition is inconsistent with typical basaltic\
    \ rock fragments but can be fit by a mixture of 60% basaltic rock fragments and\
    \ 40% meteoritic material [Clark and Baird, 1979]. The meteoritic influx we calculate\
    \ is sufficient to provide most or all of the material required by the Clark and\
    \ Baird [1979] model. Particles in the mass range from 10\u22127 to 10\u22123\
    \ g, about 60\u2013200 \u03BCm in diameter, contribute 80% of the total mass flux\
    \ of meteoritic material in the 10\u221213 to 106 g mass range at Earth [Hughes,\
    \ 1978]. On Earth atmospheric entry all but the smallest particles (generally\
    \ \u2264 50 \u03BCm in diameter) in the 10\u22127 to 10\u22123 g mass range are\
    \ heated sufficiently to melt or vaporize. Mars, because of its lower escape velocity\
    \ and larger atmospheric scale height, is a much more favorable site for unmelted\
    \ survival of micrometeorites on atmospheric deceleration. We calculate that a\
    \ significant fraction of particles throughout the 60\u20131200 \u03BCm diameter\
    \ range will survive Mars atmospheric entry unmelted. Thus returned Mars soils\
    \ may offer a resource for sampling micrometeorites in a size range which is not\
    \ collectable in unaltered form at Earth."
