  title: Study of the influence of a Bioabsorbent derived from Orange Peel on a filtering
    soil using seawater irrigation by capillarity
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract\u2014</strong> The effect of rain on our planet has\
    \ been the most important meteorological phenomena to be reproduced by humans.\
    \ It has been vital for the hydration of the soil, making it possible for agriculture\
    \ to prosper and progress. However, the great secret of irrigation is in the ground,\
    \ in the water tables and aquifers that store and manage water, storing every\
    \ drop of rain and distributing the water through the underground river basins,\
    \ indirectly irrigating everything, from the mountain to the sea, making the cultivation\
    \ of crops possible. This means that the type of soil is as important as the water\
    \ supply. Irrigation for agriculture has always simulated rainfall; therefore,\
    \ it has copied irrigation from above and has focused on the soil drainage capacity.\
    \ From this point of view, saline water is not beneficial for this activity, but\
    \ it may be the only source of irrigation water for arid regions, especially in\
    \ developing countries, where there\u2019s a scarcity of water and the population\
    \ is rapidly growing. Storing irrigation water for both agriculture and the increasing\
    \ population is necessary for the developing country\u2019s prosperity. The use\
    \ of seawater applied to irrigation is not a new technique, there\u2019s evidence\
    \ that proves that in 1719 the Sestao\u2019s Carmelite monks, located in Vizcaya,\
    \ made use of this practice. When considering the possibility of irrigation without\
    \ desalination, always through capillarity systems, it is essential to consider\
    \ some critical factors, such as the substrate of the ground, the distance of\
    \ the water table, the salt composition of the seawater, chemical reactions of\
    \ the ground with the salts or the drainage of the ground. Modifying any of these\
    \ parameters can cause salinization effects, loss of humidity or desertification\
    \ of the substrate, amongst others. This study shows the influence of a bio absorbent\
    \ obtained from the orange peel on the behaviour of a substrate based on silicon\
    \ sand."
