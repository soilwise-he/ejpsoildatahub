  title: "Soil organic carbon sequestration potential for croplands in Finland over\
    \ 2021\u20132040 under the interactive impacts of climate change and agricultural\

  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTEXT: &lt;/em&gt;Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC)
    stock can be increased by agricultural management, but is subject to various factors.
    The extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential, as well as the controlling
    factors, under different climate and management practices across a region or country
    are important for policy-makers and land managers, however have been rarely known.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OBJECTIVE: &lt;/em&gt;We aim to investigate the extent and
    rates of SOC sequestration potential over 2021-2040 under different scenarios
    of climate change and Sustainable Soil Management (SSM) practices, and quantify
    the impacts of climate change and SSM practices on the SOC sequestration potential,
    for croplands across Finland at a spatial resolution of 1 km.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METHODS: &lt;/em&gt;RothC model is run iteratively to equilibrium
    to calculate the size of the SOC pools and the annual plant carbon inputs. Then,
    it is applied to investigate the SOC sequestration potential over 2021-2040 under
    different scenarios of climate change and SSM practices. Finally, facorial simulation
    experiments are conducted to quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM practices,
    alone and in combination, on SOC sequestration potential.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: &lt;/em&gt;Under the combined impacts
    of climate change and SSM practices, the SOC sequestration potential during 2021-2040
    relative to 2020 will be on average -0.03, 0.007, 0.05, and 0.13 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
    yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, with carbon input being business as
    usual, 5%, 10%, and 20% increase. This is equivalent to an annual change rate
    of -0.04%, 0.009%, 0.07%, and 0.17%, respectively. Therefore, a 20% increase in
    C input to soil will not be enough to obtain a 4&permil; increase per year over
    the 20-year period in Finland. Carbon input will promote SOC sequestration potential;
    however, climate change will reduce it on average by 0.28 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    Across the cropland in Finland, on average, the relative contributions of C input,
    temperature, and precipitation to SOC sequestration potential in 2021-2040 will
    be 56%, 24%, and 20%, respectively, however there is a spatially explicit pattern.
    The SOC sequestration potential will be relatively high and dominated by C input
    in west and southwest Finland. By contrast, it will be relatively low and dominated
    by climate in north and east Finland, and the central part of southern Finland.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIGNIFICANCE: &lt;/em&gt;Our findings provide the information
    as to where, how much, and which SSM practices could be applied for enhancing
    SOC sequestration at a high spatial resolution, which is essential for stakeholders
    to increase cropland SOC sequestration efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;'
