  title: Analysis of soil nutrient and water relationship of Ogbujilekwe stream watershed
    in Nimo, Njikoka, Anambra State
  abstract: The study on the assessment of soil/water nutrient relationship was carried
    out at Ogbujilekwe stream watershed in Njikoka, L.G.A. of Anambra state. The objectives
    of the study were to ascertain the level of soil nutrients of the watershed, with
    respect to depth, and to find out the relationship between the Phosphorus and
    Nitrogen in the watershed, with the Phosphate and Nitrate in the nearby stream.
    The watershed was delineated into three catchments and each, having three depth,
    1, 2, 3, which ranges from 0- 20, 20-40 and 40- 60. The experimental design used
    for this research work was a randomized complete block design. The soil nutrients
    investigated include organic matter carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Also, the
    pH of the samples was tested. The result showed that soil nutrients were concentrated
    at upper depth and reduced with an increase in depth. Both the soil nutrient and
    water samples were significant (p&lt;0.05) and Phosphorus was the most significant.
    The result from correlation analysis showed that Phosphorus on land were positively
    correlated with phosphate in water. There is, therefore, a need to enforce conservation
    measures on the watershed to avert future eutrophication.
