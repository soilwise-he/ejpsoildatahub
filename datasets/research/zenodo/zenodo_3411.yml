  title: Prospects of Sustainable Soil Management  to a Green Economy
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the predominant role of soil resource as
    an integral factor that could influence the prospective contributions of agriculture
    to the green economy. It identifies soil as a natural resource that must be sustainably
    managed to maximize the contribution of agriculture to the production of food
    to feed the bourgeoning human population in Nigeria as well as reduce poverty
    level of the people. If agriculture is to contribute meaningfully to the transition
    to green economy, the soil issue must be taken seriously. To this end, the paper
    highlights certain factors that affect soil productivity which must be addressed
    to enhance the contributions of agriculture towards the realization of a green
    economy. These include soil erosion, soil salinity, perennial flooding, desert
    encroachment and drought, soil mismanagement and misuse which result in the decline
    in soil fertility. The paper therefore recommends pragmatic actions that must
    be taken to address these problems such as land&ndash;use management system like
    agroecology, agroforestry, scientific crop rotation system, no-till cultivation
    and appropriate application of soil improvement fertilizer, among others.&lt;/p&gt;'
