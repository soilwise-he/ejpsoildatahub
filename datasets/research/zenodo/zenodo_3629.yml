  title: Durability Of Lime Treated Soil Reinforced By Natural Fiber Under Bending
    Force
  abstract: 'Earth structures constructed of marine clay soils have

    tendency to crack. In order to improve the flexural strength and

    brittleness, a technique of mixing short fibers is introduced to the soil

    lime mixture. Coir fiber was used in this study as reinforcing

    elements. An experimental investigation consisting primarily of

    flexural tensile tests was conducted to examine the influence of coir

    fibers on the flexural behaviour of the reinforced soils. The test

    results that the coir fibers were effective in improving the flexural

    strength and Young''s modulus of all soils examined and ductility

    after peak strength for reinforced marine clay soil treated by lime. 5%

    lime treated soil and 1% coir fiber reinforced soil specimens''

    demonstrated good strength and durability when submerged in water

    and retained 45% of their air-cured strengths.'
