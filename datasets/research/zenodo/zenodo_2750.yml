  title: Devising recommendations based on a comprehensive assessment of the soil-geobotanical
    condition of land plots for executing afforestation activities
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The land fund is in constant flux. Lands are transferred from
    one category and land to another. The deterioration of the ecological state of
    the land, the development of erosion processes, desertification, salinization,
    pollution by chemical and radioactive substances, forest and shrubland overgrowth
    of land annually exclude significant areas from use.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;This paper reports a study of forestry stations located on the territory
    of Northern Kazakhstan. The soil was investigated by the method of laying soil
    sections and semi-pits with a description of the power of the horizons. The structure
    of the soil was determined by the method of breaking down soil samples. The granulometric
    composition was determined by the wet method with a division into sand, loam,
    light loam, medium loam, heavy loam, and clay. The chemical analysis of soil samples
    was carried out in a certified laboratory. Soluble carbonates are present in the
    samples from the Burluk forestry station. According to the structure and chemical
    analysis, the types of soils for each forestry station were defined. Based on
    the study&#39;s results, recommendations were devised for the categories of areas.
    In addition, the areas of plots suitable for all major forest species and areas
    with existing forests, forest crops, overgrown with self-sowing were determined.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;During the reconnaissance route-loop survey of land plots, the types
    of plant associations were identified. A comprehensive ecological and geographical
    study of a forestry station was carried out to execute afforestation operations.
    Basically, the identification of types of plant associations has made it possible
    to conduct a preliminary assessment on the ground about the quality of the studied
    areas for the restoration of forest areas. General recommendations were compiled
    from the direct conduct of surveys on the ground; however, systematic monitoring,
    using remote sensing methods of the Earth, could facilitate the ongoing research.
    Building on the method of integrated ecological and geographical research could
    in the future significantly improve the efficiency of forest management activities
    in general and minimize losses associated with environmental influences&lt;/p&gt;'
