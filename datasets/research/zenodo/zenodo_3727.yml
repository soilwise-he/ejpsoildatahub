  title: The Effect of the Application of Different Rates of Herbicides on Soil Microorganisms
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Background: The use of herbicide in weed control has grown significantly
    in Nigeria in recent years. Most of the application are indiscriminately carried
    out by illiterate farmers, and therefore pose a significant threat&nbsp;to the
    environment and on crop yield. This study assessed the effects of the use of glyphosate
    for land preparation, and different concentrations of primextra dual gold (atrazine
    and metolachlor), for weed control on the type and population of soil micro-organisms.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Methods: The study was carried out in Port Harcourt in two phases, using
    a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Soil samples were collected
    at the depths of 0-15cm and 15-30cm, and analyzed 4WAP and 12WAP. Serial dilution
    technique was used for the enumeration of the bacteria and fungi in the soil samples,
    using the spread plate method, and the appropriate media and incubation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Results: The use of the herbicides resulted in changes in the soil, and
    in the type and number of soil micro-organisms. There were reductions in the organic
    matter and exchangeable minerals content of the soil, and in the total count of
    the micro-organisms in the second phase of the study. The mean bacteria count
    in the first phase of the study were 5.75 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;CFU
    and 1.13 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;CFU at the depths of 0 &ndash; 15cm
    and 15 &ndash; 30cm respectively, compared to 2.88 x 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;CFU
    and 6.32 x 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;CFU in the second phase of the study.
    The reductions were more in the plots in which the herbicides had been applied
    above the recommended dose.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The application of the herbicides resulted in changes in
    the soil, and type and total number of soil micro-organisms, especially when they
    are applied at above the recommended rate. Efforts are therefore needed to educate
    farmers on the proper dosing of the herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;'
