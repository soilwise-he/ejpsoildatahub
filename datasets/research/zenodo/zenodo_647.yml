  title: USE OF OPTICAL SENSOR EQUIPMENT IN IMPROVING SOIL FERTILITY
  abstract: <em>In the agriculture of our republic, great measures are being taken
    on the correct application of mineral fertilizers. Today, the use of modern information
    technologies in almost all fields is of great importance for the development and
    prospects of the field. The use of modern equipment in the field dramatically
    increases work efficiency and creates the basis for good results. To increase
    soil productivity, the use of optical sensor equipment is one of the directions
    of innovative technology. This article covers such issues.</em>
