  title: The dynamics of soil agrochemical indicators from the "Lilac garden" exposition
    of M.M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden of the NAS of Ukraine
  abstract: "<strong>Objective</strong> \u2013 to analyse the dynamics of agrochemical\
    \ indicators of the soil under collection of <em>Syringa vulgaris</em> L. cultivars.\
    \ These indicators used for solving the problem of anisotropy of biogenic elements\
    \ distribution in the soil. <strong>Material and methods</strong>. The study has\
    \ been carried out on the \u201CLilac Garden\u201D exposition. The soil samples\
    \ were collected in the spring and in the autumn (2016\u20132018) under the <em>Syringa\
    \ vulgaris</em> plants: 1 \u2013 under lawn grasses, 2 \u2013 on the site with\
    \ permanent soil cultivation, 3 \u2013 on the site with permanent anthropogenic\
    \ pressure (under the <em>S. vulgaris</em> cultivar trees). The plants are 55\u2013\
    60 years old. The humus reserves and nutrients content were calculated for the\
    \ horizon 0\u201320 cm. The agrochemical analysis of soil samples has been done\
    \ after G. Rinkis method (1982) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission\
    \ spectrometry iCAP 6300 DUO. Soil samples were extracted by 1 N HCL. Soil samples\
    \ pH were measured by Hi 2211 pH/ORP Meter (Hanna Instruments). <strong>Results</strong>.\
    \ It were investigated agrochemical indicators study (pH, humus, N, P, K, Ca,\
    \ Mg, Fe, Mn) of <em>S. vulgaris</em> collection gray podzolized soil. The soil\
    \ solution pH indicators \u2013 6.53\u20137.50. Humus content changes were registered\
    \ during the seasons: 3.6\u20137.8 % in spring, 5.2\u20139.3 % in autumn. Maximum\
    \ concentrations of the biogenic elements were observed in different terms of\
    \ the plant vegetation cycle due to the precipitation and air temperature fluctuations.\
    \ <strong>Conclusion</strong>. The results demonstrate diverse distribution of\
    \ biogenic elements in the <em>Syringa vulgaris</em> collection soil cover. It\
    \ is to be considered for developing of plant cultivation rules for decorative\
    \ and long living<em> S. vulgaris </em>cultivars."
