  title: Analysis of soil characteristics on expansive clay stabilization using shell
    ash
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Expansive clay is one of the problems in construction work.
    The soil has the characteristics of being easy to expand when exposed to water,
    causing a decrease in the strength value of the soil. The can be overcome by stabilizing
    the soil. The soil is formed from weathering and contains the mineral montmorillonite.
    The soil is very sensitive to moisture content, has a high shrinkage rate, thus
    interfering in construction work. Therefore, additional materials are needed to
    overcome the problem, one of which is soil stabilization. The study aimed to stabilize
    the expansive clay soil. This is done by analyzing the physical and mechanical
    properties of expansive clay with a shell ash mixture. Expansive clay is taken
    directly (undisturbed) or disturbed. Undisturbed soil is taken using a tube, so
    that the soil is not disturbed by outside air, while disturbed soil is taken using
    a shovel and then put into a sack container. Expansive clay stabilization method
    lies in adding the percentage of shell ash mixture (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 %).
    The soil, the initial moisture content (&gamma;d) of which has been determined,
    is mixed, then molded into a cylindrical shape. The mold was stored in a desiccator,
    then watered with 5 % water every day until the soil became saturated. Then, using
    a Proctor test, chemical tests (soil chemical test, soil mineral test), physical
    tests (soil moisture, Atterberg limit), and mechanical tests (unconfined compression
    test, compaction test, swelling test) were carried out. The results showed that
    the addition of an oyster shell ash stabilizing agent to expansive clay affected
    the physical and mechanical properties of the soil. The addition of shell ash
    can reduce soil moisture with various plasticity indexes. While the soil stress
    value decreased, the swelling of the soil increased significantly above the original
    soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
