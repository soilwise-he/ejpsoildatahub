  title: Heavy Metal Concentration and Risk Assesment of Oil Spill Contaminated Soil
    from Ogoni in Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "This study investigated the level of Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, V, Ni and Cd in\
    \ sediment samples of an oil-spillimpacted site in Ogoni land, Okenta Alode, Eleme\
    \ local government area, Rivers state, Nigeria. Soil sediments were collected\
    \ from six different stations, with two from each station at surface (0 \u2013\
    \ 15 cm) and in-depth (15 \u2013 30 cm) levels. One of the stations involves a\
    \ bioremediated site, which was used as the control for the study, while the other\
    \ station involves oil-spill-impacted sites. Bioremediated soil, obtained at about\
    \ 200 meter away from the contaminated site was also collected making a total\
    \ of twelve (12) samples, with the coordinates of the locations recorded with\
    \ GPS device. Sample preparation and analysis were carried out using American\
    \ Society of Testing Material (ASTM) D5708 (classic wet chemistry method) using\
    \ the appropriate NIST standards. The filtrate which was containing the heavy\
    \ metals in solution was then analyzed using the Shimadzu-1 model of Flame Atomic\
    \ Absorption Spectrophotometer (APHA3111). The hierarchy of the concentrations\
    \ of metals in the sediments appeared in the trend thus; Fe &gt; Cu &gt; Zn &gt;\
    \ Cd &gt; Ni &gt; V &gt; Pb and metals concentration in the selected stations\
    \ descended in the order of P1/S/O1 &gt; P3/D/O2 &gt; P2/S/O1 &gt; P3/D/O2 &gt;\
    \ P4/S/O1 &gt; P5/D/O1 &gt; P5/S/O1 &gt; P1/D/O1 &gt; P4/D/O1 &gt; P2/D/O1 &gt;\
    \ P1/D/CO1 &gt; P1/S/CO1. The concentration of metals in the sediments were within\
    \ the permissible limits and similarly have their ADI, THQ and HI lower than their\
    \ respective reference dose (RfD) and less than 1, while the LCR of Cd were within\
    \ the permissible range for carcinogens. Iron and Cd resulted to very high ecological\
    \ risk and pollution. Also, Fe and Cd are implicated in resulting to high ecological\
    \ risk and pollution. It is thus recommended that the rate of anthropogenic activities\
    \ that tend to elevate heavy metals contamination and intoxication in this study\
    \ location be reduced to curb the risk of heavy metals bioaccumulation and possible\
    \ health effects in humans."
