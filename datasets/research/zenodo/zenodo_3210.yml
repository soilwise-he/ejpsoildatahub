  title: The effects of fertilization with anaerobic, composted and pelletized sewage
    sludge on the amount of soil organic matter in a silvopastoral system under Fraxinus
    excelsior L.
  abstract: 'Agroforestry systems have been considered a good tool for carbon (C)
    sequestration under the

    Kyoto Protocol because of their ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and
    store C mainly

    in the soil. In terrestrial ecosystems, soil organic matter is considered the
    most important store

    of C. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the fertilization
    with municipal

    sewage sludge that has been stabilized using anaerobic digestion, composting,
    or pelletization, on the amount of soil organic matter, as compared to control
    treatments (mineral and no fertilization) in a silvopastoral system under Fraxinus
    excelsior L. and a sown sward (Dactylis glomerata L., Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium
    repens L.) in Galicia (Spain). The results

    showed that silvopastoral systems have great potential to enhance C sequestration
    compared

    with pastoral systems, and therefore their implementation should be considered
    as a land-use

    option in Europe. Moreover, composted sewage sludge reduced soil C sequestration
    more

    than the control treatments, probably due to the improvement of soil pH observed
    with this

    type of sludge which increased the mineralization rate of soil organic matter.'
