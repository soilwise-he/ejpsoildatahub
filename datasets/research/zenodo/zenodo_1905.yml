  title: Application of Glass and Fan Shells to a Clay Soil to Increase its Mechanical
    Properties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Improving the mechanical properties of a clayey soil is one
    of the best options to avoid future structural failures in buildings and is cheaper
    than replacing all the material. Therefore, this article proposes the use of recycled
    glass and fan shells as reinforcement materials. This article presents an experimental
    study to evaluate the mechanical properties of a pure and mixed soil. The clay
    soil was mixed with 7% of glass (PV) and with 3%, 6%, 10%, 12% and 15% of Fan
    Shells (PCA) duly crushed and passed through sieve #100. Tests of sieve granulometry,
    sedimentation granulometry, Atterberg limits, modified proctor and drained consolidated
    direct cut were performed. This allowed comparing all the data obtained and defining
    the optimal percentage of the mixture in which the clay improves its mechanical
    properties. According to the tests carried out, the proportion that has 7% glass
    and 6% Fan Shells has better results because there is an improvement in its dry
    density from 1,784 g / cm3 to 1,847 g / cm3, its moisture content increases from
    9.4% to 12.1%. In addition, its friction angle improves from 28.9 &deg;to 32 &deg;and
    cohesion from 0.05 kg / cm2 to 0.1 kg / cm2. These results verify that the properties
    of the clay soil are improved.&lt;/p&gt;'
