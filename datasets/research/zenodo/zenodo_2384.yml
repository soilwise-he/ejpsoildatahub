  title: "Accumulation of some heavy metals by poplars and features of elements migration\
    \ in the \"soil \u2013 plant\" system"
  abstract: "We are studied dependence between maintenance of heavy metals in soil\
    \ on the industrial grounds of ore mining enterprises of Kryvorozh'ya and their\
    \ accumulation in leaves, petioles, buds and wood of one-year shoots of <em>Populus\
    \ deltoides</em> Marsh., <em>P. italica</em> Moench, <em>P. simonii </em>Carr.,\
    \ <em>P. candicans</em> Ait. and <em>P. bolleana</em> L. It was determined speciesspecificity\
    \ in accumulation of Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb and Cd, confirmed with the indexes of\
    \ intratissue contamination of poplars. It has been established the coefficients\
    \ of accumulation and redistribution of heavy metals in the \"soil \u2013 plants\"\
    \ system."
