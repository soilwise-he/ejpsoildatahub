  title: Effect of Oil Spillage on the Soil Properties
  abstract: <em>The effect of oil spillage on the properties of soil are studied in
    this work. The study site is around the vicinity of Imo River-2 flow station at
    Owaza in Abia State of Nigeria, located East of Nkali and North of Isimiri flow
    stations in the Niger Delta Basin. Soil samples were taken from three oil-impacted
    areas and an unimpacted (control) area. The contaminated areas considered are
    at the wellhead, far from the wellhead (100 metres from the wellhead) and very
    far from the wellhead (within the flow station). Soil samples were collected at
    surface (0-15 cm) depths. The soil properties considered were total hydrocarbon
    content, moisture content, soil pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon
    content, organic matter content, phosphorus content, potassium availability and
    nitrate-nitrogen content. The study shows that oil spillage affects the site where
    they occur by the reduction of the nutrients in the site (land or water)</em>.
