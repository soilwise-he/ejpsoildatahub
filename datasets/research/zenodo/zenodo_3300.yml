  title: Nylon Solution As Soil Stabilizer
  abstract: The research investigated the use of nylon solution to enhance the California
    bearing ratio (CBR) of soil. Used nylon sachet of potable water were dissolved
    in four separate solvents namely acetone, toluene, ethyl glycol and dual purpose
    kerosene (DPK). It was discovered that DPK has the highest nylon solubility of
    29g/ml at 91<sup>o</sup>C. The nylon solution was used to stabilize poorly graded
    sandy soil. The result showed that at less or equal to 4% stabilization, the CBR
    value decreased from 25.3% to 15.85% and later appreciated to 67.78% at 16% stabilization.
    The initial decrease in CBR value of soil sample observed was as a result of inadequate
    nylon solution to coat soil particles for proper bonding.
