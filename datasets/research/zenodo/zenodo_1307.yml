  title: Effect of Chemical Weed Control on Soil Bio-Chemical Indices- A Review
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> The assessment and monitoring\
    \ of soil life and soil health can be used to develop more sustainable and productive\
    \ farming systems. Hence, the consequence of herbicide application on soil health\
    \ is always a concern for the research community. In view of this, the findings\
    \ available from India in respect to the impact of herbicides on the non-target\
    \ organisms and important soil bio-chemical processes are reviewed in this paper.\
    \ There is great variation among the reports showing short term transient depressing\
    \ to non-inhibitory or even stimulatory effects of herbicides on total soil microbial\
    \ count and different soil bio-chemical indices. The impact differed depending\
    \ upon the soil type, experimental conditions, herbicide in question and its dose,\
    \ and the sensitivity of the non-target species or strains. No severe ill effect\
    \ on soil flora, soil bio-chemical indices and soil fauna has been observed so\
    \ far at recommended dose of herbicide under field conditions. However, the available\
    \ information is based on the short term experiments and there is need to develop\
    \ data base on long-term field application basis. The paper concludes with some\
    \ suggested areas for future research requiring urgent attention."
