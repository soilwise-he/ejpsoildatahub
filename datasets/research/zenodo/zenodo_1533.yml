  title: Impact of soil biological and chemical activity on spectral reflectivity
    under anaerobic conditions
  abstract: Numbers of soil samples from different areas had been selected, then wetted
    and putted them in enclosed place to ensure the anaerobic conditions, then taking
    digital images for this soils on different period, by using flatbed scanner, and
    reading its reflective during the time to find relation of the time effect on
    soil reflective, Photoshop 10 CS3 was using to read RGB values then making mathematical
    operations to calculate reflective. The study referred to the ability to draw
    the reflectivity of soil curves as part of soil studying in anaerobic circumstances,
    and it became obvious that the Spectral reflectivity of the wind deposit soil
    is decrement through the time in greatly form relatively, An indication of the
    activity of anaerobic organisms.
