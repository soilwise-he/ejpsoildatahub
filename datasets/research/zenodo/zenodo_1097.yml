  title: Quick Lime Stabilization of Ferro Laterite Soil to Subgrade Material Implementation
  abstract: This study aimed to determine and evaluate the strength characteristics
    of ferro laterite soil with lime stabilization on a particular mixture composition.
    Ferro laterite soil obtained from three different locations with conventional
    sampling process at 0-1 meters of depth, wrapped in the sample bag and labeled
    according to the location, namely LH1 for the Subaim location, LH2 for Buli location,
    and LH3 for Maba location. The sampling results were tested for physical properties
    of the soil according to ASTM and SNI standardization, involved testing; moisture
    content, particle size distribution, specific gravity, and the limits of Atterberg,
    as well as compaction test. Making of the soil test specimen is done by mixing
    the ferro laterite soil with the addition of lime in a composition of 3%, 5%,
    7%, and 10% on the initial condition of maximum density and optimum moisture content
    standard Proctor test results. Cylindrical test specimen with dimensions H = 2D,
    then cured for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before being tested for soil compressive
    strength with UCS testing. The test results showed that the ferro laterite soil
    stabilization with lime increases the compressive strength for the three types
    of ferro laterite soil that is significantly until the curing time of 28 days
    (72-254 kPa, 156-291 kPa, 80-272 kPa, respectively for LH1, LH2 and LH3), resulting
    with an increase in the percentage of lime addition. Similarly, the increase in
    curing time up to 28 days, resulting in an increase of soil compressive strength,
    in which the bond between grains of soil with lime increasingly stable. Based
    on these test results, the ferro laterite soil has the potential to be used as
    road base material and construction material, but it is necessary to test in detail
    the physical model (prototype) prior to implementation in the field
