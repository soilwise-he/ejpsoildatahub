  title: Mobilization of Phosphate in Relation to Ferrous-Ferric Equilibrium in Soil
  abstract: Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp; Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra
    Krishi Views. Vidyalaya, Kalyani, West Bengal <em>Manuscript received 21 October
    1976, accepted 7 February 1977</em> The mobilization of native and applied phosphate
    in relation to ferrous-ferric equilibrium in son has been studied. Native phosphate
    has no significant and immediate role on the conversion of ferrous Iron to ferric
    state. But the increase in phosphate activity enhances the degree and rate of
    oxidation of ferrous ions and as a result most of the applied phosphate are transported
    to the non-labile pool. The fixation of applied phosphate particularly in acid
    sons is very little effected by the exchangeable ferric iron. Possibly it is the
    free ferric oxide which is active in retention of phosphate.
