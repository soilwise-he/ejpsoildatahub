  title: Bone Ash Impact On Soil Shear Strength
  abstract: Most failures of soil have been attributed to poor shear strength. Consequently,
    the present paper investigated the suitability of cattle bone ash as a possible
    additive to improve the shear strength of soils. Four soil samples were collected
    and stabilized with prepared bone ash in proportions of 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15% and
    20% by dry weight. Chemical analyses of the bone ash; followed by classification,
    compaction, and triaxial shear tests of the treated soil samples were conducted.
    Results obtained showed that bone ash contained high proportion of calcium oxide
    and phosphate. Addition of bone ash to soil samples led to increase in soil shear
    strengths within the range of 22.40% to 105.18% over the strengths of the respective
    control tests. Conversely, all samples attained maximum shear strengths at 7%
    bone ash stabilization. The use of bone ash as an additive will therefore improve
    the shear strength of soils; however, using bone ash quantities in excess of 7%
    may not yield ample results.
