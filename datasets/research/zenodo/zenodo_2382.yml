  title: Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon with Machine Learning in Dryland of
    Northeast and North Plain China
  abstract: "Due to the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in supporting ecosystem\
    \ services, accurate SOC assessment is vital for scientific research and decision\
    \ making. However, most previous studies focused on single soil depth, leading\
    \ to a poor understanding of SOC in multiple depths. To better understand the\
    \ spatial distribution pattern of SOC in Northeast and North China Plain, we compared\
    \ three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\
    \ and Random Forest (RF)) within the digital soil mapping framework. A total of\
    \ 386 sampling sites (1584 samples) following specific criteria covering all dryland\
    \ districts and counties and soil types in four depths (i.e., 0\u201310, 10\u2013\
    20, 20\u201330 and 30\u201340 cm) were collected in 2017. After feature selection\
    \ from 249 environmental covariates by the Genetic Algorithm, 29 variables were\
    \ used to fit models. The results showed SOC increased from southern to northern\
    \ regions in the spatial scale and decreased with soil depths. From the result\
    \ of independent verification (validation dataset: 80 sampling sites), RF (R<sup>2</sup>\
    \ : 0.58, 0.71, 0.73, 0.74 and RMSE: 3.49, 3.49, 2.95, 2.80 g kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\
    \ in four depths) performed better than Cubist (R<sup>2</sup> : 0.46, 0.63, 0.67,\
    \ 0.71 and RMSE: 3.83, 3.60, 3.03, 2.72 g kg<sup>\u22121</sup> ) and XGBoost (R<sup>2</sup>\
    \ : 0.53, 0.67, 0.70, 0.71 and RMSE: 3.60, 3.60, 3.00, 2.83 g kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\
    \ ) in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. Soil, parent material and\
    \ organism were the most important covariates in SOC prediction. This study provides\
    \ the up-to-date spatial distribution of dryland SOC in Northeast and North China\
    \ Plain, which is of great value for evaluating dynamics of soil quality after\
    \ long-term cultivation."
