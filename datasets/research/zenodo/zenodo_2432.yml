  title: Climatic and soil integrant that drive forest tree species diversity and
    distribution across cross-river state, Nigeria
  abstract: "Awareness of the ecological needs of forest tree species is a necessity\
    \ for effective and tenable forest management, conservation and restoration. Our\
    \ study used the modified Whittaker sampling method to assess the diversity and\
    \ distribution of forest tree species at twenty-two forest sites across northern,\
    \ central, and southern Cross River State, Nigeria, and to analyse climatic and\
    \ soil integrant that drive the diversity and distribution of tree species in\
    \ forests. Only tree species with dbh \u2265 30 cm were identified and recorded.\
    \ Tree species occurrence points were also marked using Global Positioning System\
    \ (GPS) software. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model and principal\
    \ component analysis (PCA) for each zone were used to study climate and soil integrant\
    \ that drive forest tree species diversity and distribution, respectively. The\
    \ results of the survey revealed a great diversity of tree species in the forests,\
    \ as 398 species belonging to 64 families were recorded. The maxEnt model established\
    \ six climatic integrants that drive forest tree species diversity and distribution\
    \ across Cross River State. These are 'BIO 3 \u2013 isothermality', 'BIO 4 - temperature\
    \ seasonality', 'BIO 7 - annual temperature range', 'BIO 12 - annual precipitation',\
    \ 'BIO 16 - precipitation of wettest quarter', and BIO 17 - precipitation of driest\
    \ quarter. PCA revealed that the soil in the northern zone had seven main integrants\
    \ (iron, Available Phosphorus, manganese, exchangeable cations, silicon, Hydrogen\
    \ ion and organic matter); ten in the central zone (zinc, organic matter, iron,\
    \ Total Nitrogen, Sodium, boron, clay, soil pH, exchangeable acids and silicon);\
    \ and nine in the southern zone (sand, silt, Organic Carbon, Manganese, Hydrogen\
    \ ion, Calcium, cation exchangeable capacity, Potassium and clay) that drive species\
    \ diversity and distribution. Our findings can be used as rudimentary details\
    \ for managing forest and ecosystem preservation at all levels and, characteristically,\
    \ for forest conservation across Cross River State, Nigeria.\_"
