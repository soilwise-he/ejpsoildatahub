  title: "Liquid Microbial Biofertilizers LMF for enhancing soil fertility  \u2013\
    \ A Review"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The nutrients of biological origin added to the soil to enrich
    the soil fertility are called biofertilizers. Biofertilizers is a substance contains
    living microorganisms which promote the adequate supply of nutrients to the host
    plants and ensure their proper development of growth and regulation in their physiology.
    Biofertilizer reduce the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture. They never
    cause pollution in air, water and land. Indiscriminate synthetic fertilizer usage
    has polluted the soil, water basins, destroyed micro organisms and eco friendly
    insects, made the crop more susceptible to diseases and depleted soil fertility
    at the primary levels as of today&#39;s scenario is to overcome these problems
    which is the main reason for this review. On this basis, Microorganisms have been
    emerged as the potential alternative for the productivity, reliability and sustainability
    of the global food chain. These review focuses on liquid biofertilizer technology
    providing reliable reason for their necessity, specificity and emphasizes the
    use of agriculturally important microorganisms in different combinations i.e.,
    Liquid Microbial Consortium LMC is the only solution for restoration of soil health.
    Biofertilizers supply plant nutrients NPK nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
    It can be produced by using renewable wastes. Tamilkodi. R | Victoria. J &quot;Liquid
