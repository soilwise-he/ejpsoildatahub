    \ Eucalyptus plantations in Colombia"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;          Eucalyptus spp. are widely planted in Colombia as
    an important component of a growing paper and pulp industry. Leaf and shoot blight
    caused by Calonectria spp. was one of the first disease problems to emerge in
    these plantations. A survey of Eucalyptus plantations in four forestry regions
    of Colombia during 2016 resulted in a large number of Calonectria isolates from
    soil samples collected in the understories of trees having symptoms of Calonectria
    leaf and shoot blight. The aim of this study was to identify and resolve the phylogenetic
    relationships for these isolates using DNA sequence comparisons of six gene regions
    as well as morphological characters. From a collection of 107 isolates, seven
    Calonectria species residing in three species complexes were identified. Two of
    these represented undescribed species, namely C. exiguispora sp. nov. and C. guahibo
    sp. nov. Calonectria parvispora and C. spathulata were the most commonly isolated
    species, each of which accounted for approximately 30% of the isolates. The results
    suggest that Colombia has a wide diversity of Calonectria spp. and that these
    could challenge Eucalyptus plantation forestry in the future.&lt;/p&gt;'
