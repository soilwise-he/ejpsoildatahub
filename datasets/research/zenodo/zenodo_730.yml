  title: Long-Term Effects of Calcium-Based Liming Materials on Soil Fertility Sustainability
    and Rye Production as Soil Quality Indicators on a Typic Palexerult
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Liming is a common practice used to improve acidic soil properties, as
    is essential for agricultural quality. A long-term field experiment with one lime
    rate (6000 kg/ha of carbonate calcium equivalent) and three calcium-based liming
    amendments (gypsum, limestone and sugar foam) was maintained on a Typic Palexerult
    for 10 years in order to determine changes in soil acidity and to assess the effects
    on crop (rye) yields. The soil acidity conditions decreased with all the amendments
    tested, but the sugar foam and limestone was more effective than gypsum over a
    long-term period. No significant changes in organic soil matter levels between
    the treatments tested were found. Interestingly, an increase in the leaching of
    organic soil matter was observed in limed soils. Lime application significantly
    increased the total rye biomass compared to the control soils during the whole
    experiment (2002&ndash;2011). Yield trends observed in spike and stem biomass
    were similar to those reported for total rye biomass. In this respect, at the
    end of the research, gypsum, limestone and sugar foam increased in relation to
    the total production of rye biomass by 16%, 32% and 38%, respectively, as compared
    to the control soils. Additionally, a significant and prolonged difference in
    calcium concentrations in rye stems between unlimed and limed subplots was observed.
    However, in spite of the results presented here, further investigations are needed
    to gain a better understanding of the long-term effects of liming on the chemical
    properties of soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
