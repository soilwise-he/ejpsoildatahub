  title: "Response of soil\u2013surface arthropod population densities across the\
    \ 15 different soil management treatments"
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> In India, there have been very few studies\
    \ to quantify the effects of soil macrofauna activity in farmland, and on the\
    \ effects of farm practices on the structure and function of soil arthropod populations.\
    \ Thus, the present investigation was undertaken and efforts were made to assess\
    \ the response of soil\u2013surface arthropod population densities across 15 different\
    \ soil management treatments. The relative population density of soil\u2013surface\
    \ inhabiting arthropods were monitored using pitfall traps. Pitfall traps have\
    \ been used often in studies examining the occurrence and activity of epigeic\u2013\
    invertebrates. These arthropods were sampled in each plot every month during three\
    \ seasons, i.e., rainy (June to September,) post rainy (October to January) and\
    \ summer (February to May) seasons. Each pitfall trap consisted of a glass jar\
    \ (12 cm high with a diameter of 5 cm at the mouth), which was sunk into the ground\
    \ so that its upper rim (mouth of the bottle) was flushed with the soil surface.\
    \ The mean density of total arthropods were significantly low in annual treatments\
    \ compared with those of the perennial ley treatments. Under the annual crop,\
    \ in zero\u2013tillage treatments, the density was low in bare amendment while\
    \ it was high in rice-straw amendment. In shallow\u2013tillage treatments, it\
    \ was lower in rice\u2013straw amendment and increased to 22 in bare amendment,\
    \ In deep\u2013tillage treatments, it was low in bare amendment, which increased\
    \ to 28 in farmyard manure amendment. In perennial ley treatments, the density\
    \ was low in C. ciliaris + S. hamata treatment, which reached 35 in pigeon pea\
    \ + S. hamata treatment. <strong>REFERENCES</strong> Reddy, M.V., Yule , D.F.,\
