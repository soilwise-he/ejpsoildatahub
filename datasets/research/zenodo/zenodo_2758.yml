  title: A vertical representation of soil carbon in the JULES land surface scheme
    (vn4.3_permafrost) with a focus on permafrost regions
  abstract: "An improved representation of the carbon cycle in permafrost regions\
    \ will\nenable more realistic projections of the future climate\u2013carbon system.\n\
    Currently JULES (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) \u2013 the land surface\n\
    model of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) \u2013 uses the standard four-pool\
    \ RothC\nsoil carbon model. This paper describes a new version of JULES\n(vn4.3_permafrost)\
    \ in which the soil vertical dimension is added to the\nsoil carbon model, with\
    \ a set of four pools in every soil layer. The\nrespiration rate in each soil\
    \ layer depends on the temperature and moisture\nconditions in that layer. Cryoturbation/bioturbation\
    \ processes, which\ntransfer soil carbon between layers, are represented by diffusive\
    \ mixing. The\nlitter inputs and the soil respiration are both parametrized to\
    \ decrease\nwith increasing depth. The model now includes a tracer so that selected\
    \ soil\ncarbon can be labelled and tracked through a simulation. Simulations show\
    \ an\nimprovement in the large-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of soil\n\
    carbon over the standard version of JULES (vn4.3). Like the standard version\n\
    of JULES, the vertically discretized model is still unable to simulate enough\n\
    soil carbon in the tundra regions. This is in part because JULES\nunderestimates\
    \ the plant productivity over the tundra, but also because not\nall of the processes\
    \ relevant for the accumulation of permafrost carbon, such\nas peat development,\
    \ are included in the model. In comparison with the\nstandard model, the vertically\
    \ discretized model shows a delay in the onset\nof soil respiration in the spring,\
    \ resulting in an increased net uptake of\ncarbon during this time. In order to\
    \ provide a more suitable representation\nof permafrost carbon for quantifying\
    \ the permafrost carbon feedback within\nUKESM, the deep soil carbon in the permafrost\
    \ region (below 1 m) was\ninitialized using the observed soil carbon. There is\
    \ now a slight drift in\nthe soil carbon (\u2009&lt;\u2009\u202F0.018\u202F%\u202F\
    decade&lt;sup&gt;\u22121&lt;/sup&gt;), but the change in\nsimulated soil carbon\
    \ over the 20th century, when there is little climate\nchange, is comparable to\
    \ the original vertically discretized model and\nsignificantly larger than the\
    \ drift."
