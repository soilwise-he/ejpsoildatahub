  title: "Influence Of Biochemicals On The Productivity Of Maize Green Mass And Grain\
    \ Cultivated On Sod\u2013Podzolic Light Loamy Soil"
  abstract: "The paper discusses the effects of PolyFunKur and Agromik biofertilizers\
    \ on the biometrics of maize, as well as on its green mass and grain yield on\
    \ sod\u2013podzolic light loamy soil.\n\nMethods: phenological, agrochemical,\
    \ microbiological.\n\nThe use of Agromik and PolyFunKur biochemicals increases\
    \ biometric indicators of maize during its development phases in comparison with\
    \ the control. The highest yield of the maize green mass for silage was in the\
    \ test with the treatment of seeds and vegetative organs in the tillering phase\
    \ in Poli funk ur. In this test, the yield increased up to 57.2 c/ha over the\
    \ control. In the agromik test, the increment of green mass was slightly lower,\
    \ i. e. 43.3 c/ha over the control. Comparison the polylinker and agro Mik tests\
    \ reveal the difference to be 13.9 centners/ha. The highest maize grain yield\
    \ was noted in the PolyFunKur test to be 1.9 c/ha more than in Agromik test and\
    \ 7.3 c/ha more than in the control."
