  title: Influence Of Olive Mill Waste Water Spreading On Soil Microbial Activity.
    Short Term Effect On Carbon And Nitrogen Mineralization Process
  abstract: 'Mineralization is the core of the symbiotic relation between soil - microorganism
    and plant. It is the generator of mineral elements essential to the plants nutrition.
    Microorganisms are the main biotic actors in this process. The product of the
    mineralization depends, on the one hand, on the biomass of the soil and on the
    other hand on the quantity, nature and characteristics of the organic matter.


    The monitoring of the mineralization is therefore essential after any input of
    organic matter with a view to its valorisation which effects are unpredictable.


    It is in this context that we propose to study the impact of the three successive
    annual intakes of OMWW on the process of mineralization of organic matter and
    the soil content of carbon and mineral nitrogen.'
