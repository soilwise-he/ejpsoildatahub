  title: Environmental characteristics, including soil and vegetation composition,
    in relation to the occurrence patterns of an endangered lizard, Eremias argus,
    in a fluvial island, South Korea
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;      &lt;i&gt;Eremias argus&lt;/i&gt;, known as the Mongolian\
    \ racerunner, is a reptile that has been designated as a level II endangered species\
    \ in South Korea since 2005 despite being listed as \"Least Concern\" by the International\
    \ Union for Conservation of Nature. Particular vegetation and soil characteristics\
    \ are critical components of the habitat of &lt;i&gt;E. argus&lt;/i&gt;, which\
    \ is an ectotherm. However, research on the environmental characteristics of &lt;i&gt;E.\
    \ argus&lt;/i&gt; living on a fluvial island is lacking. This study sought to\
    \ characterize the soil environmental factors and vegetation composition of &lt;i&gt;E.\
    \ argus&lt;/i&gt; habitats on Doriseom Island, South Korea by dividing the island\
    \ into an area in which &lt;i&gt;E. argus&lt;/i&gt; occurred frequently (F zone)\
    \ and an area in which &lt;i&gt;E. argus&lt;/i&gt; occurred rarely (R zone). Both\
    \ soil hardness and cobble cover were significantly higher in the R zone (soil\
    \ hardness: 1.6 \xB1 0.2 kg\u2027cm-2, mean \xB1 standard error; cobble cover:\
    \ 40 \xB1 5%) than in the F zone (soil hardness: 0.9 \xB1 0.1 kg\u2027cm-2; cobble\
    \ cover: 18 \xB1 3%). Plant litter cover did not differ significantly based on\
    \ &lt;i&gt;E. argus&lt;/i&gt; occurrence. The vegetation composition within F\
    \ and R zones appeared distinct, though &lt;i&gt;Coreopsis lanceolata&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ dominated both zones. A sand dune sedge, &lt;i&gt;Carex pumila&lt;/i&gt;, thrived\
    \ in F zone sites, where soil hardness was low, while the endemic &lt;i&gt;Aster\
    \ danyangensis&lt;/i&gt;, which prefers cobble areas, was found largely in the\
    \ R zone. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;E. argus&lt;/i&gt; was most commonly found in\
    \ areas with low soil hardness dominated by dune vegetation. Understanding endangered\
    \ species' habitat requirements can provide important clues for establishing conservation\
    \ plans and restoration measures.&lt;/p&gt;"
