  title: One-dimensional experimental study of rainfall infiltration into unsaturated
    soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper presents experimental results obtained from tests
    on unsaturated soil in one-dimensional columns simulating a rainfall infiltration
    process. Six columns composed of compacted Silty Sand were prepared to study the
    effects of the initial water&lt;br&gt;

    content and rainfall intensity on the downward infiltration process. The advance
    of the water front was monitored using sensors to measure pore water pressure
    and volumetric water content installed at different locations along the height
    of the Silty Sand column. The test results show that the lag time, defined as
    the time difference from the beginning of the test to a sudden increase in the
    volumetric water content readings, was influenced by the soil initial water content
    and rainfall intensity; it is observed that the lag time is shorter at higher
    initial water contents and greater rainfall intensities. The results provide insights
    to understand the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated slopes and embankments exposed
    to rainfall infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;'
