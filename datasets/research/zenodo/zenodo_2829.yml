  title: 'MACSUR SciPol Policy Brief 2: Synergies and Trade offs between Soil Improving
    Management, Climate Change Mitigation and Agri Food Productivity'
  abstract: "The health of our soil is fundamental to the delivery of essential ecosystem\
    \ services; agricultural productivity, food security and environmental welfare\
    \ ( e.g. ecological integrity and conservation, crop nutrition, carbon sequestration\
    \ (balancing) and animal welfare etc.). Moreover, soils are an integral part of\
    \ developing agricultural policies, e.g. UK Agricultural Bill, 2020; Environmental\
    \ Land Management Scheme. This policy brief delivers the output of the UK \u2018\
    Capturing the Potential of Soil\u2019 workshop (held on 23 March 2021) which focused\
    \ on the link between soil health, primarily soil organic carbon, and productivity.\
    \ Emphasis is placed on the research challenges to improve soil health, the implementation\
    \ priorities that must be held and the potential co-benefits could be. The MACSUR\
    \ SciPol knowledge forum is a pilot exercise initiated by the Joint Programming\
    \ Initiative for Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE JPI) to\
    \ bring science and policy actors together for the strategic design of climate\
    \ change adaptation and mitigation solutions in the agri-food sector in Europe.\
    \ This policy brief contributes to this mission by providing evidence-based information\
    \ to policy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, adapting to climate change\
    \ and understanding synergies and trade-offs in achieving these targets."
