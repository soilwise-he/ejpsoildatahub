  title: 'Data from: Drought alters soil microbiome-mediated plant coexistence'
  abstract: Soil microbes and climate change control plant coexistence through feedback
    effects and create fitness differences between competing individuals. Until now,
    microbiome-mediated coexistence between plants has often been considered in terms
    of modeling prospects, and there is little empirical data to unravel the effects.
    We inoculated 5 soil assemblages (SK, Artemisia fangensis (AF), Artemisia fangensis,
    Artemisia, Artemisia, Bulbophyllum and Coleoptera) in a monoculture and mixture
    of 5 plant species symbiotic in the temperate grasslands of China, and inoculated
    the plant assemblage (root zone soil for SK<em>,</em> <em>Cold Artemisia</em>
    (AF), <em>enoki</em> mushroom root zone soil). <em> </em> (AC), equal mixtures
    of three root zone soils (MIX), and sterilized MIX(S) as well as drought treatment.
    We found that the microbiome-mediated fitness difference was stronger than the
    stabilization effect, resulting in two species from the three plant species pairs
    we tested being excluded. Species coexistence was observed in only one species
    pair, with differences in competitiveness and competitive fitness similar to those
    of specific soil communities. Drought affects plant coexistence by affecting plant
    competition and plant-soil feedback. The results of this study suggest that both
    competition and drought affect plant-soil feedback effects and, ultimately, species
    coexistence. Future work should examine how plant competition and soil microbial
    heterogeneity work with climate change that affects plant coexistence.
