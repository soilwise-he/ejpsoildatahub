  title: Soil and pasture evolution of zinc in a silvopastoral system developed under
    Quercus rubra L. after fertilization with different doses of sewage sludge
  abstract: "One option adopted in many countries around the world is the use of sewage\
    \ sludge as\nfertilizer in agriculture. However, the use of this residue as fertilizer\
    \ must take into consideration\nits heavy metal concentration (mainly Zn), which\
    \ is higher than that normally\nfound in soils and may lead to crop toxicity and\
    \ environmental degradation. The aim of\nthis study was to evaluate the effects\
    \ of different doses of municipal sewage sludge (100,\n200 and 400 kg total N\
    \ ha\u20131) on the total and available Zn concentrations in soil and the\nZn\
    \ levels of pasture compared to control treatment (no fertilization) in a silvopastoral\
    \ system\nunder Quercus rubra L., and a sown sward with Dactylis glomerata L.,\
    \ Lolium perenne\nL. and Trifolium repens L. during the four years after the study\
    \ was established in Galicia\n(Spain). The results showed that fertilization with\
    \ sewage sludge increased the concentration\nof Zn in the soil and plants, mainly\
    \ when high doses of sewage sludge were applied\n(400 kg total N ha\u20131), but\
    \ never exceeded the maximum values set by Spanish regulations\nand did not cause\
    \ harmful effects on plants and animals."
