  title: Growth response and antioxidant enzyme activity of Cassia occidentalis exposed
    to soil moisture stress
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> Biotic and abiotic stresses exert a considerable\
    \ influence on the growth and physiology of plants. Water stress is one of the\
    \ most important abiotic stress factors. The study was carried out to elucidate\
    \ the effect of drought stress on growth, physiology and antioxidant enzyme activity\
    \ of <em>Cassia occidentalis </em>experiencing four water regimes with soil relative\
    \ water content ranging from 65% to 12%. Plants were grown in pots and treated\
    \ with three irrigation levels (100ml, 200ml and 300ml).The experiment was laid\
    \ out in complete randomized design (CRD) with three replicates. Data on growth,\
    \ physiological parameters and antioxidant enzyme activity were recorded and analyzed\
    \ statistically. Physiological parameters like leaf area index, biomass accumulation,\
    \ relative water content and membrane stability index decreased significantly\
    \ with decrease in water level, but mild level of water treatment enhanced the\
    \ growth. The plant exhibited an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity under\
    \ stressed condition which proves its tolerance against drought. Thus it can be\
    \ concluded that <em>Cassia occidentalis</em> plant is able to tolerate a limited\
    \ water levels by enhancing its antioxidant defense but excessive drought markedly\
    \ affected the enzyme activity and so depleted the plant growth. <strong>Key words\
