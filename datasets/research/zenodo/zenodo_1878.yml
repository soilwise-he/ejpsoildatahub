  title: Long-term soil metal exposure impaired temporal variation in microbial metatranscriptomes
    and enriched active phages
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;It remains unclear
    whether adaptation and changes in diversity associated to a long-term perturbation
    are sufficient to ensure functional resilience of soil microbial communities.
    We used RNA-based approaches (16S rRNA gene transcript amplicon coupled to shotgun
    mRNA sequencing) to study the legacy effects of a century-long soil copper (Cu)
    pollution on microbial activity and composition, as well as its effect on the
    capacity of the microbial community to react to temporal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:
    &lt;/strong&gt;Despite evidence of microbial adaptation (e.g., iron homeostasis
    and avoidance/resistance strategies), increased heterogeneity and richness loss
    in transcribed gene pools were observed with increasing soil Cu, together with
    an unexpected predominance of phage mRNA signatures. Apparently, phage activation
    was either triggered directly by Cu, or indirectly via enhanced expression of
    DNA repair/SOS response systems in Cu-exposed bacteria. Even though total soil
    carbon and nitrogen had accumulated with increasing Cu, a reduction in temporally
    induced mRNA functions was observed. Microbial temporal response groups (TRGs,
    groups of microbes with a specific temporal response) were heavily affected by
    Cu, both in abundance and phylogenetic composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:
    &lt;/strong&gt;Altogether, results point toward a Cu-mediated "decoupling" between
    environmental fluctuations and microbial activity, where Cu-exposed microbes stopped
    fulfilling their expected contributions to soil functioning relative to the control.
    Nevertheless, some functions remained active in February despite Cu, concomitant
    with an increase in phage mRNA signatures, highlighting that somehow, microbial
    activity is still happening under these adverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
