  title: Effects Of Axial Loads And Soil Density On Pile Group Subjected To Triangular
    Soil Movement
  abstract: Laboratory tests have been carried out to investigate the response of
    2x2 pile group subjected to triangular soil movement. The pile group was instrumented
    with displacement and tilting devices at the pile cap and strain gauges on two
    piles of the group. In this paper, results from four model tests were presented
    to study the effects of axial loads and soil density on the lateral behavior of
    piles. The responses in terms of bending moment, shear force, soil pressure, deflection,
    and rotation of piles were compared. Test results indicate that increasing the
    soil strength could increase the measured moment, shear, soil pressure, and pile
    deformations. Most importantly, adding loads to the pile cap induces additional
    moment to the head of front-pile row unlike the back-pile row which was influenced
    insignificantly.
