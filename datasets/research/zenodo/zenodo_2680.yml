  title: Change of root absorption capacity of introduced ornamental flowering plants
    in conditions of soil pollution by iron and chromium
  abstract: The influence of soil pollutants iron and chromium on root absorption
    of ornamental flowering plants has been studied. The decrease of the total root
    surface was determined in all tested species with respect to control, moreover,
    working surface decreases more than root surface, which does not work. The lesser
    size of absorbtive surface in comparison with control is stipulated by inhibition
    of root growth and length, shortage of root hair length and thickness, hairs quantity
    per root surface unit.
