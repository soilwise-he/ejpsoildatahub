  title: Numerical Modeling Of California Bearing Ratio Value Of Fibre Reinforced
    Fly Ash Stabilized Expansive Soil
  abstract: Expansive soils causing significant damage to civil engineering structures.
    It has become a worldwide problem. In United States during 1973, the annual cost
    of damage was $2.3 billion due to expansive soil movement. A more up-to- date
    it has reached up to $9 billion annual damages to different structures. This paper
    presents experimental study of California bearing ratio values of soil-fly ash
    mixtures and randomly distributed Nylon fibres. The effect of addition of Nylon
    Fibres on California bearing ratio values (CBR) is studied. The percentage of
    HT Nylon 66 Fibres content is considered as 0.25 %, 0.75% and 1.25 % by stabilize
    soil- fly ash mixtures.
