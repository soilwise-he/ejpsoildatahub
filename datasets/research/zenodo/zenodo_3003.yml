  title: Isolation Of Neurospora Crassa From Cocoa Farm Soil, Antibacterial And Identification
    Of Bioactive Compounds In The Extract Using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer
  abstract: 'Soil has been a free gift of nature that the creator has giving mankind
    for exploration, there is a world-wide effort by the pharmaceutical chemists to
    continue to search for new antibiotics, anti-viral, antiparasitic and host of
    other novel drugs as a result of the grave consequences posed by the current diseases
    that have developed resistance to many of the known drugs. Neurospora crassa from
    Fifty years old cocoa farm soil in Ikota, Nigeria was isolated, cultured to yield
    maximum bioactive compounds using locally designed and fabricated fermenter and
    bioactive compounds were extracted in ethyl acetate and purified through column
    chromatography. The fraction X5 was screened for antibacterial activities using
    agar well diffusion; it has strong zones of inhibition (mm) against Staphylococcus
    aureus, Bacillus substillis, and Escherichia coli. The results were better than
    streptomycin standard. The strong antibacterial activities displayed may be connected
    to the presence of bioactive compounds revealed by the  Gc-Ms and these are: 1H-indene,2,3-dihydro-4-methyl
    having retention time 5.485, height area 310344 and % total 8.267; 1H-Indene,2,3-dihydro-1,2-dimethyl  with
    retention time 6.375, height area 99678 and % total 3.214 and 1H-indene,1-ethylidene
    having retention time 8.743, height area 134010 and % total 3.567, Naphthalene
    having retention time 6.191, % of total 18.907 and peak height 700240. From the
    research work, the cocoa farm soil is an eye opener for the pharmaceutical chemists
    where they can beam their search point into for the discovery of new and novel
    compounds that may have various biological activities.'
