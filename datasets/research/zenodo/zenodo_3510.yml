  title: Radioactivity Of The Agricultural Soil In Northern Province Of Serbia, Vojvodina
  abstract: During the year 1999, Serbia (ex Yugoslavia) and their northern province,
    Vojvodina, has been bombarded. Because of that general public believe is that
    this region was contaminated by depleted uranium and that there is a potential
    contaminant of agricultural products due to soil radioactivity. This paper presents
    the repeated analysis of agricultural soil samples in Vojvodina. The same investigation
    was carried out during the year 2001, and it was concluded that, based on the
    gamma-spectrometric analysis of 50 soil samples taken from the region of Vojvodina,
    there haven-t been registered any increase of radioactivity that could endanger
    the food production. We continue with the monitoring of this region. The comparison
    between those two sets of results is presented.
