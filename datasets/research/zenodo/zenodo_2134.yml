  title: 'Precision Nutrient Application Techniques to Improve Soil Fertility and
    Crop Yield: A Review with Future Prospect'
  abstract: Precision nutrient application techniques have gained significant attention
    in modern agriculture as a means to enhance soil fertility management and optimize
    crop yield. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of various precision
    nutrient application techniques and their potential to address the challenges
    of food security and sustainability. The review highlights key technologies, methodologies,
    and practices that contribute to precise nutrient management, including real-time
    monitoring, variable rate application, GIS-GPS integration, drone-based data collection,
    and data analysis tools. The importance of accurate data, challenges related to
    field variability, and the need for skilled personnel is discussed. Furthermore,
    the review delves into the potential of advancements such as machine learning
    and AI-driven solutions in overcoming challenges and advancing precision nutrient
    application. These technologies offer predictive models, adaptive management strategies,
    and real-time decision support systems. By emphasizing the benefits of precision
    nutrient application, including improved nutrient uptake by plants, reduced nutrient
    runoff, and enhanced plant health, this review underscores its potential to revolutionize
    modern agriculture. Ultimately, precision nutrient application techniques hold
    promise in enhancing soil fertility, optimizing crop yield, and promoting sustainable
    agricultural practices, making a significant contribution to global food security
    and environmental sustainability.
