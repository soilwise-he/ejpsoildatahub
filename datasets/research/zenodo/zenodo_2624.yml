  title: Phytoextraction of Cu, Cd, Zn and As in four shrubs and trees growing on
    soil contaminated with mining waste
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mining activity has degraded large extensions of soil and its
    waste is composed of metals, anthropogenic chemicals, and sterile rocks. The use
    of native species in the recovery of polluted soils improves the conditions for
    the emergence of other species, tending to a process of ecosystem restoration.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioaccumulation of metal(loid)s
    in four species of native plants and the effect of their distribution and&nbsp;&lt;a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bio-availability"&gt;bioavailability&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in
    soil with waste from an abandoned gold mine. Soil samples were taken from two
    sites in La Planta, San Juan, Argentina: Site 1 and Site 2 (mining waste and reference
    soil, respectively). In Site 1, vegetative organ samples were taken from&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Larrea
    cuneifolia&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bulnesia retama&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plectrocarpa
    tetracantha&lt;/em&gt;, and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Prosopis flexuosa&lt;/em&gt;. The concentration
    of metal(loid)s in soil from Site 1 were Zn&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Cu&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Cd,
    reaching values of 7123, 6516, 240 and 76&nbsp;mg&nbsp;kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
    respectively. The contamination indices were among the highest categories of contamination
    for all four metal(loid)s. The spatial interpolation analysis showed the effect
    of the vegetation as the lowest concentration of metal(loid)s were found in rhizospheric
    soil. The maximum concentrations of As, Cu, Cd and Zn found in vegetative organs
    were 371, 461, 28, and 1331&nbsp;mg&nbsp;kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;L.
    cuneifolia&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;B. retama&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;presented
    high concentrations of Cu and Zn. The most concentrated metal(loid)s in&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P.
    tetracantha&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P. flexuosa&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;were
    Zn, As and Cu. Cd was the least concentrated metal in all four species. The values
    of BAF and TF were greater than one for all four species. In conclusion, the different
    phytoextraction capacities and the adaptations to&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/arid-environment"&gt;arid
    environments&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;of these four species are an advantage for future&nbsp;&lt;a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phytoremediation"&gt;phytoremediation&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;strategies.
    Their application contributes to the ecological restoration and risk reduction,
    allowing the recovery of ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;'
