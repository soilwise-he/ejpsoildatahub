  title: Exploring hydrocarbon degrading ability of bacteria isolated from engine
    oil polluted soil.
  abstract: "This study was conducted to assess the capabilities of bacterial isolates\
    \ obtained from oil-polluted sites with waste engine oil. Engine oil is made of\
    \ crude petroleum, it mainly consists of hydrocarbons which includes aliphatic,\
    \ aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl compounds, resins etc. and trace amounts of Sulphur\
    \ or nitrogen.To treat these toxic pollutants bioremediation is an environment\
    \ friendly approach toreduce their intensity of toxicity. Waste engine oil contaminated\
    \ soil samples were collected from specific garage areas in Mangalore, and assessed\
    \ for high hydrocarbon and oil degradation capacity. The screening process involved\
    \ conducting both biochemical and molecular tests to assess the potential of the\
    \ isolated organism. Furthermore, the study employed emulsification index and\
    \ gravimetric analysis to evaluate the isolates' efficacy in emulsifying and degrading\
    \ potential of oil. Molecular tests confirmed the presence of three significant\
    \ bacterial species\u2014<em>Klebsiellaquasipneumoniae</em>, <em>Stutzerimonasstutzeri</em>,\
    \ and <em>Klebsiella pneumonia</em>showing their potential for waste engine oil\
    \ bioremediation. Moreover, the research sheds light on the microbial diversity\
    \ and functionality within oil-contaminated environments. In conclusion, this\
    \ study uncovers the potential of bacterial isolates for effective waste engine\
    \ oil bioremediation. It emphasizes the significance of employing these isolates\
    \ to promote sustainable waste management practices,"
