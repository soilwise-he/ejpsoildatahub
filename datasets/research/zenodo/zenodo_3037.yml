  title: Soil-geographic Study in the Area of Iron Age Pits Sanctuary and a Middle
    Ages Settlement near the Kaptain Andreevo Railway Station
  abstract: 'This paper presents the results of soil investigation in the archaeological
    site 27 near the settlement Kapitan Andreevo (SE Bulgaria). The following soil
    types are recognized: Fluvisols, Vertisols, Luvisols and Planosols. Their spatial
    distribution is closely related to the Pliocene facial surface that consists of
    erosion, abrasion and accumulative deposits in the region and presents a transitional
    zone in the investigated archaeological area.These circumstances depend on the
    terrain and climate conditions over thousands of years and have determined the
    mosaic nature of the three soil types. The results support the archaeological
    investigation in the study area and were additionally filled with GIS-based analysis
    of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using open software GRASS GIS.'
