  title: Responses of soil bacterial communities to invasive Australian Acacia species
    over large spatial scales
  abstract: The impacts of invasive plants on soil bacterial communities are less
    well understood than are their impacts on the aboveground components of the communities
    they invade. This is surprising given the important roles that belowground communities
    play in ecosystem functioning. An example is South Africa's Cape fynbos, a global
    biodiversity hotspot which is highly fragmented and threatened. We use next-generation
    sequencing data to investigate how invasive Australian <em>Acacia</em> species
    (wattles) impact broad-scale composition, and turnover of soil bacterial communities.
    Our comparisons of bacterial communities across different fynbos habitats, in
    both wattle-invaded and uninvaded (pristine) soils, and sampled across multiple
    seasons, found invasion to significantly change the composition and turnover of
    these communities. Differences in soil bacterial communities between invaded and
    pristine soils were primarily driven by differences in soil pH and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>
    as well as seasonality. Finally, we found that the presence of invasive wattles
    reduces the spatial structure of fynbos soil bacterial community composition by
    weakening the pattern of distance decay of compositional similarity in pristine
    soil communities. Consequently, restoration efforts of wattle-invaded and degraded
    fynbos habitats should account for the important functional links between below-
    and aboveground terrestrial ecosystems, especially altered bacterial communities.
