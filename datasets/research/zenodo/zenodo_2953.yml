  title: Study Of Grass-Legume Intercropping System In Terms Of Competition Indices
    And Monetary Advantage Index Under Acid Lateritic Soil Of India
  abstract: Association of sabai grass (Eulaliopsis binata) and blackgram (Vigna mungo)
    was studied under three intercropping ratios viz., 1:1, 1:2 and 3:5 for two years
    under acid lateritic soil. Both sabai grass and blackgram were grown as sole crop
    for comparison. It was found that leaf yield of sabai grass was significantly
    higher in intercropping than in monoculture system with the maximum value under
    1:2 ratio. Higher land equivalent ratio (up to 2.01) and monetary advantage index
    (as high as US $ 207.0) was recorded under 1:2 intercropping ratio. The growth
    and yield of blackgram were affected when intercropped with sabai grass as compared
    to sole crop. Intercropped blackgram recorded up to 68.7% decrease in grain yield
    when compared with sole blackgram.
