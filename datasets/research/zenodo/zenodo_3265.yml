  title: THE EFFECT OF A COMBINATION OF SOIL IMPROVEMENT AND N, P, K FERTILIZER ON
    K-POTENTIAL, K-dd, K-UPTAKE, AND YIELD OF LOWLAND RICE (Oryza sativa L.) IN INCEPTISOLS
    FROM JATINANGOR
  abstract: "Low fertility is one of the issues in Inceptisols. One solution to solve\
    \ this issue by provide a combination of soil conditioners containing organic\
    \ matter and N, P, and K fertilizers as available nutrient elements to optimize\
    \ soil fertility, thus improving the quality and quantity of rice. This experiment\
    \ aims to determine the best dosage of the combination of soil improvement and\
    \ N, P, and K fertilizers for K-potential, K-uptake, and rice crop results on\
    \ Inceptisols from Jatinangor. The experiment was conducted from July to December\
    \ 2023 at the Soil Chemistry and Plant Nutrition Laboratory Experiment Garden,\
    \ Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Sumedang. The research\
    \ design used was\_ Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) consisting of eight\
    \ treatments and four replications, namely: control; N, P, K dose recommendation;\
    \ soil improver; \xBD soil improver+ \xBE dose of N, P, K; \xBE soil improver+\
    \ \xBE dose of N, P, K; 1 soil improver+ \xBE dose of N, P, K; 1\xBD soil improver+\
    \ \xBE dose of N, P, K; and 1 soil improver+ 1 dose of N, P, K. The results of\
    \ the experiment indicate that the treatment of 1\xBD soil improver+ \xBE dose\
    \ of N, P, K can provide the best influence in increasing K-potential content,\
    \ K-dd, K-uptake, and rice crop result (number of grains per panicle, 100-grain\
    \ weight, and milled rice weight) in Inceptisols from Jatinangor."
