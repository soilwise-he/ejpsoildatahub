  title: Soil/Phytofisionomy eu Relationship in Southeast of Chapada Diamantina, Bahia,
    Brazil
  abstract: "This study aims to characterize the physicochemical aspects of the soils\
    \ of southeastern Chapada Diamantina-Bahia related to the phytophysiognomies of\
    \ this area, rupestrian field, small savanna (savanna fields), small dense savanna\
    \ (savanna fields), savanna (Cerrado), dry thorny forest (Caatinga), dry thorny\
    \ forest/savanna, scrub (Carrasco-ecotone), forest island (seasonal semi-deciduous\
    \ forest-Cap\xE3o) and seasonal semi-deciduous forest. To achieve the research\
    \ objective, soil samples were collected in each plant formation and analyzed\
    \ in the soil laboratory of ESALQ-USP in order to identify soil fertility through\
    \ the determination of pH, organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium,\
    \ potential acidity, sum of bases, cation exchange capacity and base saturation.\
    \ The composition of soil particles was also checked; that is, the texture, step\
    \ made in the terrestrial ecosystems laboratory of the Department of Ecology of\
    \ USP and in the soil laboratory of ESALQ. Another important factor also studied\
    \ was to show the variations in the vegetation cover in the region as a function\
    \ of soil moisture in the different existing physiographic environments. Another\
    \ study carried out was a comparison between the average soil moisture data with\
    \ precipitation data from three locations with very different phytophysiognomies.\
    \ The soils found in this part of Bahia can be classified into 5 classes, with\
    \ a predominance of oxisols. All of these classes have a great diversity of physical\
    \ and chemical properties, as can be seen in photographs and in particle size\
    \ and fertility analyzes. The deepest soils are located in the Central Pediplano\
    \ of Chapada Diamantina where the dirty field, the clean field, the executioner\
    \ and the semideciduous seasonal forest (Cap\xE3o) are located, and the shallower\
    \ soils were found in the rupestrian field, dry thorny forest, and savanna fields,\
    \ the latter located on a hillside. As for the variations in water in the region's\
    \ soil, the data indicate that there were large spatial variations in humidity\
    \ in both the rainy and dry periods."
