  title: Mobilization of Iron in Soil and Its Influence on Phosphate Availability
    Through the Chelating Effects of Aqueous Extracts of Some Green Manuring Plant
    Materials
  abstract: Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture,
    University of Kalyani, West Bengal <em>Manuscript received </em>16 <em>April </em>1974;
    <em>accepted </em>2 <em>May </em>1975 Mobilization of iron in soil through the
    chelation effects of the aqueous extracts of Alfalfa, Berseem and <em>P. calcaratus
    </em>plant materials, and its effect on the release of phosphate has been studied
    with two types of West Bengal soil at different levels of pH and different submergence
    periods. The maximal release of iron was observed in all cases on incubation of
    the soil samples for 15 days. Irrespective of soils the order of chelating ability
    was observed to be Alfalfa <em>&gt;</em> <em>P. calcaratus &gt; </em>Berseem.
    No definite correlation could, however, be obtained between the release of iron
    and phosphate availability.
