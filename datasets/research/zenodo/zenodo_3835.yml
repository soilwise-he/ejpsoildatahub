  title: Soil And Groundwater Remediation Proposal In An Aquifer Of Venezuela By Hydrocarbon
    Transport Geostatistical Modeling
  abstract: <em>In this paper, it is presented a remediation proposal for soil and
    groundwater remediation proposal in an aquifer of Venezuela by hydrocarbon transport
    geostatistical modeling. The contamination with hydrocarbons is occurring in the
    northern region of an aquifer of the Carabobo State implying that the contaminants
    might be transported toward downstream of the aquifer causing an impact on the
    water for human consumption and industrial uses. The condition of the confined
    aquifer due to the alternating layers of low plasticity clay with well graded
    sand has avoided that the hydrocarbons in the soil reach a concentration that
    exceeds to the environmental regulation. For groundwater, the concentration of
    the hydrocarbons such as TPH, TPH-GRO, Lead, Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, m.Xylene,
    o.Xylene and MTBE is greater than to the environmental regulation.  In most of
    cases, the spatial prediction of hydrocarbons is explained by local polynomial
    interpolation of orders between 2 and 3, and in minor proportion by global polynomial
    interpolation of orders between 2 and 3.  The gradient of the linear regression
    function varies between 0.34 and 0.94. The proposal of remediation for hydrocarbons
    in soil and groundwater consists of applying of air injection and vapor extraction,
    requiring an estimated air injection of 13153 m<sup>3</sup>/d (323 cfm) and the
    vapor extraction of 5075 m<sup>3</sup>/d (125 cfm). The proposed wells for air
    injection (42) and vapor extraction (19) in a Carabobo State aquifer separated
    each 100 meters and 150 meters, respectively.</em>
