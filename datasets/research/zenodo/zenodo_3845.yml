  title: Growth and Physiological Activities of Selected Leguminous Crops Grown in
    Carbonated Fly Ash Amended Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Present study was conducted to analyze the impact of varying
    levels of fly ash on the soil quality and plant growth. Pot experiments in random
    block design were conducted with different proportions of fly ash added to the
    soil to assess the effect of fly ash and carbonated fly ash on various growth
    parameters, biochemical content and antioxidant activities of Vigna radiata and
    Vigna mungo. Observations suggested normal seed germination in fly ash treated
    plants. No visible symptoms of either nutrient deficiency or phytotoxicity were
    observed in any case. Significant positive (p&le; 0.01) correlations between heavy
    metals concentration in the soil and physical growth as well as photosynthetic
    pigments indicates the stimulating effect of fly ash on various growth parameters
    like length, fresh and dry weight of roots and shoots, germination rate and chlorophyll
    content. The increase in the activity of antioxidative enzymes and antioxidants
    synthesis in plants with higher doses of carbonated fly ash is indicative of plant&rsquo;s
    ability to tolerate heavy metal toxicity. Thus, soil application of carbonated
    fly ash has the potential not only for improving their production but also for
    solving their disposal problem.&lt;/p&gt;'
