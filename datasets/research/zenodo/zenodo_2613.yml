  title: Dynamics of Strength Gain in Sandy Soil Stabilised with Mixed Binders Evaluated
    by Elastic P-Waves during Compressive Loading
  abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilisation of poor subgrade soil
    for improving its engineering properties and stiffness. The study aim is to evaluate
    the effects from single and mixed binders on the gain of strength in sandy soil
    over the period of curing. We propose an effective non-destructive approach of
    using P-waves for identifying soil strength upon stabilisation. The growth of
    strength and stiffness is strongly dependent on time of curing and type of the
    stabilising agents which can include both single binders and their blended mixtures.
    The diverse effects from mixed binders on the properties of soil were evaluated,
    compared and analysed. We performed the experimental trials of five different
    binders for stabilisation of sandy soil using cement, lime, Ground Granulated
    Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS), energy fly ash and bio fly ash. The methodology included
    soil stabilisation by binders during a total period of 90 days, strength test
    for the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and seismic tests on the stabilised
    samples. The dynamics of soil behaviour stabilised by different binders for days
    7, 14, 28 and 90 was statistically analysed and compared. The optimisation of
    binder blending has been performed using mixture simplex lattice design with three
    binders in each case as independent variables. Using P-waves naturally exploited
    strength characteristics of soil samples and allowed us to compare the effects
    from the individual and blended binders over the complete period of curing with
    dominating mixes. The results indicate that strength growth in stabilised soil
    samples is nonlinear in both time and content of binders with dominating effects
    from slag which contributed the most to the compressive strength development,
    followed by cement.
