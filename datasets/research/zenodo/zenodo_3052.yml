  title: lmpact of aluminium sulphate fertiliser on selected soil properties and the
    efficiency and quality of pine seedlings in the forest ground tree nursery
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The alkalisation of soil is a common phenomenon in forest ground
    nurseries. Liming, inadequate fertilisation and the use of hard water for irrigation
    are the main reasons for this alkalisation. The aim of this study was to investigate
    the effect of fertilisation with aluminium sulphate on soil pH, the activity of
    selected soil enzymes, efficiency as well as the growth parameters of pine seedlings.
    The study was conducted in a forest nursery, on a plot with soil pH 6.4 in water
    and 5.9 in 1M KCl. Such a pH is not conducive to the production of conifer seedlings,
    particularly pines. Two different doses of aluminium sulphate fertiliser were
    applied: 740 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1110 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    Both doses significantly reduced the soil pH, whereas soil enzyme activity did
    not change. The lower dose had a positive impact on the growth parameters of pine
    seedlings, while the higher dose led to their deterioration. We observed statistically
    significant differences in average primary and lateral root lengths, number of
    short roots, and thickness of the neck root of seedlings. One- and 2-year-old
    seedlings did not show symptoms of nutrient deficiency and neither did concentrations
    of the investigated macronutrients and selected micronutrients in needles indicate
    such. After applying the higher fertiliser dose, we observed a favourable change
    in the composition of mycorrhizae. Out of the potential seedling pathogens we
    found &lt;em&gt;Cylindrocarpon&lt;/em&gt; spp., &lt;em&gt;Fusarium&lt;/em&gt;
    spp.,&lt;em&gt; Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt; spp., &lt;em&gt;Pythium&lt;/em&gt; spp.
    and &lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/em&gt; of which the most frequent were Fusarium
    oxysporom, &lt;em&gt;Pythium&lt;/em&gt; spp. and &lt;em&gt;R. solani&lt;/em&gt;.
    Their occurrence frequency differed between the treatments used in this experiment.&lt;br
    /&gt;

    This study confirms the positive effects of a low aluminium dose on the performance
    and growth parameters of pine seedlings. However, on the basis of the conducted
    experiments, it is difficult to say, whether this positive effect is due to a
    direct action of aluminium on the seedlings or rather an indirect effect caused
    by lowering the soil pH, which in tum impacts on mycorrhizae composition and hence
    pathogen development.&lt;/p&gt;'
