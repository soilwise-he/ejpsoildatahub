  title: EFFECT OF FLYASH INCORPORATION IN SOIL ON GERMINATION AND SEEDLING CHARACTERISTICS
    OF RICE (Oryza sativa L.)
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> Fly ash is a waste product of Industrial plants\
    \ that pose serious environmental hazards. The possibility of using fly ash as\
    \ a soil amendment in the reclamation of disturbed areas is a research topic of\
    \ growing interest. The present study evaluated effects of fly ash on germination\
    \ of rice crops to work out the optimum level of ash addition and relate germination\
    \ effects with early seedling vigour characteristics caused by mixing ash with\
    \ the soil. Increase in concentration of fly ash decrease in seed germination\
    \ and least germination was seen in 100 % fly ash while seedling growth in terms\
    \ of both shoot length and root length was found to be significantly more in low\
    \ concentration (25%) of fly ash in compared to the control and higher concentrations\
    \ of Fly ash. There was no significant difference of leaf Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll\
    \ b in control and different treatments, but the total chlorophyll found to be\
    \ more in 25% of fly ash concentration followed by 100 % of fly ash and least\
    \ was observed in control condition, while SPAD index was decreased with the increase\
    \ of fly ash concentration in the incorporated soil. The study revealed that the\
    \ fly ash in low concentration could be beneficial in improving plant growth and\
    \ early seedling vigour of rice plants can be used as soil amendment and, while\
    \ adverse effects was observed at higher levels. This finding is encouraging for\
    \ an agro-friendly disposal of this potential multiple-pollutant in rice cultivation\
    \ and soil-fertilization as well. <strong>Key Words: </strong>Chlorophyll<strong>;\
