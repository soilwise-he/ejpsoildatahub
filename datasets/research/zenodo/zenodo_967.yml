  title: Survey on Improving the Prediction of Soil Classification and Crop Suggestion
  abstract: <em>Agriculture plays an important role in the Indian economy. It remains
    the major provider for employees and source of revenue of our country. The main
    focus of this survey is on how to improve the soil quality and crop production.
    We are going to study the classification problem and prediction of village wise
    soil parameters. Both are dependent on soil testing samples for finding soil fertility
    indices and pH values which represent a detail overviewing on application of machine
    learning in agriculture base. Mostly above problems are solved using machine learning
    technique which also achieve better accuracy in these areas. By applying machine
    learning in real time data which enabled program to present high testimonial and
    deep perceptivity for experts and farmers to make correct decision and take proper
    action.</em>
