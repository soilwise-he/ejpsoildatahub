  title: An Experimental Study on Shear Strength of Soil Subgrade using Cement as
    Stabilizing Agent
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Construction of any civil engineering structural project whether
    it is building, bridge, dam or road etc is done on or below the surface of earth.
    The main purposes of any structure is to transmit the load to the soil beneath,
    so the soil beneath should be strong enough to bear the upcoming loads without
    undergoing any failure. Construction of any structure over a weak soil is highly
    difficult and unsafe as the soil undergoes differential settlements due to high
    compressibility and poor shear strength. Hence it is most important for us to
    check the engineering properties of soil before construction.Sub grade is the
    underlying soil that supports the applied wheel load .If the sub grade of the
    soil is too weak to support the wheel loads, the pavement will flex excessively
    which ultimately causes the pavement to fail.The current study deals with the
    enhancement of shearing strength of soil which is one of the most engineering
    property of soil using cement as an additive to reduce sub grade failure.Therefore
    the present study gives an idea for improving the geotechnical engineering properties
    of the soil used for the pavement sub grade by using the additive which have mixed
    into the soil to get the desired improvement to fulfill the strength criteria.
    This criteria can be applied to the roads and air fields having a much stabilized
    surface layer. This can be achieved by mixing the sandy soil and Ordinary Portland
    Cement with the water and compacting the mix to get a stronger composite materialTherefore,
    the present investigation describes the behavioral aspect of soils mixed with
    0 , 5 , 10 and 15 cement by volume of soil to improve the load bearing capacity
    of the soil. Shear strength and index properties such as water content, MDD, OMC,
    etc. were determine and analyzed for the purpose of enhancement of pavement sub
    grade.The resultant material becomes hard and durable structural material as cement
    get hydrated and gained strength by adding 5 , 10 and 15 of the cement by volume
    with the sandy soil. Compaction test was applied to determine the maximum dry
    density and the optimum moisture content of the soil by adding 5 ,10 and 15 of
    cement, in this the dry density first increases at 5 and 10 .The bearing capacity
    of any soil usually increases with increasing dry density and decreasing moisture
    content. The shear strength also increases, because increase in cementing content
    causes increase in shear strength by 13.75 , 19.19 and 9.4 respectively with respect
    to soil containing 0 of cement. High density assures high shear strength and greater
    imperviousness .Overall we can say that soil stabilization for pavement sub grade
    using cement as additive is a good ground improvement technique especially in
    engineering projects on weak soils. the geotechnical engineering properties of
