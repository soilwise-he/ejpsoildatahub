  title: 'Effects Of Magnetic Treatment Of Irrigation Water On The Quality Of Soil:
    A Comprehensive Review'
  abstract: 'Background and Objective: In recent years, positive effects of magnetized
    water treatment have been shown on growth processes and the development of plant
    tissues through a change in the soil content. The objective of the current study
    is to review the effects of magnetized water on the quality of soil. Method: The
    databases of Scopus (1980-2016), EMBASE (1980-2016), Web of Sciences (1980-2016),
    and Google Scholar (1980-2016) were searched to find the published studies with
    the keywords of "magnetic treatment" OR "magnetized water", AND "irrigation water"
    AND "soil" AND "effect". The obtained titles were reviewed and the relevant studies
    were selected for comprehensive review of the current literature. Results: Magnetic
    water technologies used in agriculture can improve the quality and quantity of
    products. The current evidence shows that magnetic treated irrigation water changes
    soil and harvest content through increasing the level of specific minerals including
    N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn and reducing S content. Conclusion: Although
    using magnetic water is agriculture is in early stage, studies have shown relatively
    promising outcomes and to reach established technology further controlled studies
    are needed. Studies to shed more light on the mechanisms of action of the observed
    effects are important in this regard. Keywords: Magnetized Water, Soil, Irrigation
    Water, Effect'
