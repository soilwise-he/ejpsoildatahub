  title: Studies of the mechanical performance of SH85 and cement-stabilized lateritic
    aggregates soil
  abstract: "Abstract The objective of this research is to improve the mechanical\
    \ characteristics of lateritic soils with calcium silicate (CaSiO3) with the trade\
    \ name SH-85 as a chemical additive and Portland cement. Laboratory tests have\
    \ been conducted on natural lateritic gravels (particle size analysis, Atterberg\
    \ limits, Modified Proctor test and CBR test), but also on SH-85 stabilized lateritic\
    \ aggregates.\n\nInvestigations conducted at the University of Oregon to evaluate\
    \ the elemental composition of the SH85 stabilizer have confirmed the use of calcium\
    \ Silicate (CaSiO3), which formula was precisely studied by (Ndiaye et al, 2022).\
    \ As a chemical additive the percentage of the binder was fixed at 4%. \n\nThe\
    \ results of the tests conducted in Senegal showed that CBR increases by 192%\
    \ for SH85 enhanced laterite compared to 183% for cement. The compression strength\
    \ (UCS) gives a value of 2.29 MPa for SH85 treated samples against 2.01 MPa for\
    \ Portland cement ones. The tensile strength (TS) is 0.29 MPa for SH85 treated\
    \ samples compared to 0.26 MPa for Portland cement ones."
