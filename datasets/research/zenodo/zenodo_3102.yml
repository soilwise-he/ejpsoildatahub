  title: Cultivation of Two Species of Mushroom Found in Anambra State, South-Eastern,
    Nigeria and Their Potentials for Bioremediation of Trace Metals Polluted Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Two species of Mushroom namely Amanita phalaoides and Amanita
    verosa were studied and they were collected from farmlands in Uke town around
    Onitsha metropolis in Anambra State, Nigeria. The mushroom samples were cultivated
    on normal agricultural and refuse dump soils. The young growing mushrooms were
    watered twice daily and harvested within fourteen 14 days. The harvested mushroom
    samples were sun dried and kept in pre cleaned bottles for chemical analysis.
    The dried samples were cut into pieces and pulverized using binatone blender with
    stainless blade and they were subjected to chemical analysis using standard analytical
    methods AOAC . The obtained data were analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS versions 16.0.
    Duncan&#39;s Range was applied in separating means where differences were observed.
    The results ranged as follows moisture content MC 81.79 to 97.84 , the highest
    value was from Amanita Phalaoides. Dry matter DM ranged from 2.63 to 18.36 shows
    an indication of high roughages contained by mushrooms. Crude protein CP ranged
    from 8.16 to 24.67 which compared favourably with values of seeds and legumes.
    Ash contents ranged from 3.26 to 14.33 and they are indications of high mineral
    elements present in mushroom species. Low values of Lipid fat oil ranged from
    1.00 to 6.68 are indications that mushrooms are excellent dietary food for diabetic
    and coronary heart disease patients. Crude fibre CF ranged from 2.62 to 15.37
    . Values of Ethanol soluble sugar ESS , carbohydrate CHO and vitamin C were close
    showing no significant difference at p 0.05. Values of phytic acid, tannins and
    hydrocyanic acid ranged from 0.01 to 0.27 mg 100g, these were quite low to give
    adverse effect. The mean concentrations of nutrients metals mg kg of Na, K, Ca,
    Mg and Fe ranged from 276.48&plusmn;0.27 to 826.83&plusmn;0.04 while trace metals
    Cu, Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Mn, Cr concentrations mg kg ranged from 0.001&plusmn;0.01
    to 43.18&plusmn;0.20. Cobalt was most bio accumulated in agric soil while Zn was
    most bio accumulated in refuse dump soil. Dr. (Mrs) B. C. Ilechukwu | Prof. C.
