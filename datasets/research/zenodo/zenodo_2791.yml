  title: The Potential of Soil Properties in the Stability of Buildings a Case Study
    of Collapsed Building in Kwang Jos, Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> The investigation of soil properties is vital\
    \ in determining causes of building collapse in Nigeria today, but most times\
    \ the geotechnical tests and analysis are neglected and site engineers are held\
    \ responsible for the collapse. This paper seeks to investigate the soil properties\
    \ of a collapse building site in order to emphasize the need for a geo-technical\
    \ investigation as a vital tool in the built environment. Investigation of soil\
    \ properties which includes sieve analysis, moisture content, specific gravity,\
    \ Atterberg limits and shear strength were conducted on samples collected from\
    \ the site. Two foundation bases were exposed (Base and Trial pits). Disturbed\
    \ and undisturbed samples labeled Sample 1/1, Sample 2/1 and Sample 2/2 and recorded\
    \ as Base 1, Trial pit 3 and Trial pit respectively were collected at the foundation\
    \ depths of the exposed foundations by driving the sampler at various depths of\
    \ 0.8m, 0.8m and 0.5m and tested. The soil\u2019s silty nature and low bearing\
    \ capacity of 36.37KN/m<sup>2</sup> as the investigation revealed was a major\
    \ cause of the collapse and that the building collapse site was a made-up ground.\
    \ There was no geo-technical investigation prior to the building construction.\
    \ Other causes such as the used of sub-standard materials, poor construction quality,\
    \ quackery and supervision boils down to the lack of soil investigation which\
    \ has caused the building foundation to fail and has resulted to the collapse\
    \ of the building. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Building Collapse, Foundation, Atterberg\
