  title: Integrated Measures for Soil and Water Management
  abstract: The main obstacles to food security are the immense pressure from the
    constantly growing population and the diminishing availability of land and water.
    Intensive agricultural practises hasten the deterioration of soil health. Similarly
    increased groundwater exploitation also caused a decline in groundwater level.
    Accelerated soil erosion is a result of anthropogenic activities like slash-and-burn
    agriculture, overgrazing, deforestation, and intensive and inefficient agricultural
    practises. This increased rate of soil erosion decreases soil and crop productivity
    over time by removing organic matter and plant nutrients from the fertile topsoil.
    A higher canopy cover and mulching of crop residues prevent soil particles from
    detaching from the soil surface and protect it from intense rainfall, which lowers
    the rate of surface runoff and lessens the effects of rainfall erosivity and soil
    erodibility. Moreover, it also conserves soil moisture and retains sediment and
    organic materials. The threat that agriculture poses to groundwater is also a
    serious problem, especially because groundwater is a hidden resource and its degradation
    and restoration frequently occur gradually. However, it is now necessary to offer
    workable and long-term solutions to keep the groundwater table high. There are
    many different approaches being used to find a more long-lasting balance. A holistic
    approach to managing soil and water resources is necessary for both the future
    viability of agriculture and the preservation of the natural ecosystem. As a result,
    the adoption of advanced irrigation technologies, no-till farming, conservation
    tillage, direct seeded rice, precision land levelling, agroforestry, and crop
    diversification are all essential for soil and water conservation.
