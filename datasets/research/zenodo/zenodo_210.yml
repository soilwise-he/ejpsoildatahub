  title: 'Hydroponics: Green Fodder Production without Soil'
  abstract: Green fodder plays a significant role in the diet of dairy animals since
    it offers the nutrients required for both maintaining health and productivity.
    Generally, it is observed that the feed cost constitutes about 70 to 75% of the
    total cost of milk where in green fodder comprises 13 to 35% of the total feed
    input. But it is become difficult to produce required quantity green fodder throughout
    the year due to shrinkage of land available for grazing, lack of water, more labour
    requirement a climatic impediment. The unavailability of quality green fodder
    adversely affects the productive and reproductive efficiency of the dairy animals.
    The lack of green fodder compels the farmer to look for alternative options and
    explore sustainable methods of obtaining quality green fodder. In such situation,
    the novel approach called Hydroponic fodder would be the best solution.
