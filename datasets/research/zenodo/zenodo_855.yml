  title: 'Terrestrial isopods as model organisms in soil ecotoxicology: a review'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Isopods play an important role in the decomposition of leaf
    litter and therefore are making a significant contribution to nutrient cycling
    and soil ecosystem services. As a consequence, isopods are relevant models in
    soil ecotoxicology, both in laboratory toxicity tests and in field monitoring
    and bioindication studies. This paper aims at reviewing the use of isopods as
    test organisms in soil ecotoxicology. It provides an overview of the use of isopods
    in laboratory toxicity tests, with special focus on comparing different exposure
    methods, test durations, and ecotoxicological endpoints. A brief overview of toxicity
    data suggests that chemicals are more toxic to isopods when exposed through soil
    compared to food. The potential of isopods to be used in bioindication and biomonitoring
    is discussed. Based on the overview of toxicity data and test methods, recommendations
    are given for the use of isopods in standardized laboratory toxicity tests as
    well as in situ monitoring studies.&lt;/p&gt;'
