  title: Influence of organic fertilizers on the issue of carbonic gas in the soil
    under vegetable crops
  abstract: "The article discusses the use of manure and other organic fertilizers\
    \ serving for plants as a source of mineral nutrients with the release of CO<sub>2</sub>\
    \ when decomposed, it saturates the soil air and the surface layer of the atmosphere\
    \ contributing to the plant\u2019s air nutrition. Field and laboratory experiments\
    \ were carried out in 4-fold repetition in 6 varieties with legumes (beans and\
    \ lentils), in 7 varieties with pepper, tomato, and eggplant. Mathematical calculation\
    \ was performed to identify the correlation between the content of organic matter\
    \ and the production of CO<sub>2</sub> from the soil. It was found that the higher\
    \ the content of organic matter in the soil, the more it emits CO<sub>2</sub>\
    \ under conditions of aeration and humidity, and the correlative high relationship\
    \ confirms the contiguity and tightness between these parameters, where p = +\
    \ 0.94 + 0.04 (beans); p = + 0.97 + 0.02 (pepper)."
