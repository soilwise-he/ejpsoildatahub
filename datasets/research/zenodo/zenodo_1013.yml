  title: Paenibacillus xanthanilyticus sp. nov., a xanthan-degrading bacterium isolated
    from soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A xanthan-degrading bacterium, strain AS7 T , was isolated from
    soil and its taxonomic position was determined using a polyphasic approach. Strain
    AS7 T was a Gram-stain-variable, spore-forming, motile, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium.
    Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain
    AS7 T belongs to the genus Paenibacillus, sharing the highest level of sequence
    similarity with Paenibacillus phyllosphaerae PALXIL04T (98.0 %). The cellwall
    peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. MK-7 was the dominant isoprenoid
    quinone and the major fatty acid was anteiso-C15: 0. Polar lipids consisted of
    diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and two
    unknown phospholipids. These chemotaxonomic characteristics were consistent with
    the isolate belonging to the genus Paenibacillus. The G+C content of the genomic
    DNA was 51.0 mol% and the DNA&ndash;DNA hybridization value between strain AS7
    T and P. phyllosphaerae PALXIL04 T was only 14.4&plusmn;2.5 %. On the basis of
    phylogenetic analyses, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and DNA&ndash;DNA
    relatedness value, strain AS7 T represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus,
    for which the name Paenibacillus xanthanilyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type
    strain is AS7 T (=IBRCM 10987 T =LMG 29451 T ).&lt;/p&gt;'
