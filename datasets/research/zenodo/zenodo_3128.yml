  title: Accretional soil formation in northern hemisphere loess regions - evidence
    from OSL- dating of the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition from China, Europe
    and North America
  abstract: "Loess deposits intercalated by paleosols are detailed terrestrial archives\
    \ of Quaternary climate variability providing information on the global dust cycle\
    \ and landscape dynamics. Their paleoclimate significance is most often explored\
    \ by quantifying the<br> mineral magnetic properties due to their sensitivity\
    \ to local/regional hydroclimate variability. Detailed chronological assessment\
    \ of such regional proxy records around the climatic transitions allow a better\
    \ understanding of how regional records react to<br> major global climatic transitions\
    \ such as the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition.<br> First, logs of high-resolution\
    \ magnetic susceptibility and its frequency dependence were used as paleoclimatic\
    \ proxies to define the environmental transition from the last glacial loess to\
    \ the current interglacial soil as reflected in nine loess-paleosol<br> sequences\
    \ across the northern hemisphere, from the Chinese Loess Plateau, the southeastern\
    \ European loess belt and the central Great Plains, Nebraska, USA. Second, the\
    \ onset of increase in their values above typical loess values was used to assess\
    \ the onset of, and developments during, the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition.\
    \ High-resolution luminescence dating is applied on multiple grain-sizes (4-11\
    \ \u03BCm, 63-90\u03BCm, 90-125 \u03BCm) of quartz extracts from the same sample\
    \ in order to investigate the<br> timing of Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition\
    \ in the investigated sites. The magnetic susceptibility signal shows a smooth\
    \ and gradual increase for the majority of the sites from the typical low loess\
    \ values to the interglacial ones. The initiation of this increase, interpreted\
    \ as recording the initiation of the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition\
    \ at each site, was dated to 14-17.5 ka or even earlier. Our results highlight\
    \ the need of combining paleoclimatic proxies (magnetic susceptibility) with absolute\
    \ dating when investigating the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic transition as reflected\
    \ by the evolution of this proxy in order to avoid chronostratigraphic misinterpretations\
    \ in loess-paleosol records caused by simple pattern correlation. The detailed\
    \ luminescence chronologies evidence the continuity of eolian mineral dust accumulation\
    \ regardless of glacial or interglacial global climatic regimes. Coupled with\
    \ magnetic susceptibility records it indicates that dust sedimentation and pedogenesis\
    \ act simultaneously and result in the formation of accretional Holocene soils\
    \ in loess regions across the Northern Hemisphere. The luminescence ages allowed\
    \ the<br> modelling of accumulation rates for the Holocene soil which are similar\
    \ for European, Chinese and U.S. loess sites investigated and vary from 2 cm ka-1\
    \ to 9 cm ka-1. While accretional pedogenesis has often been implicitly or explicitly\
    \ assumed in paleoclimatic<br> interpretation of loess-paleosol sequences, especially\
    \ in the Chinese Loess Plateau, our luminescence data add direct evidence for\
    \ ongoing sedimentation as soils formed."
