  title: 'Delayed effect of thermal treatment on breaking physical seed dormancy:
    intrapopulation variation and implications for soil seed banks'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Many studies have focused on the dormancy-breaking response
    to heat treatment of freshly matured seeds and immediately after thermal shock.
    Aims. We evaluated whether the full effect of dry heat scarification in freshly
    matured seeds could be delayed over time and the possible influence of previous
    storage in the soil. Methods. Adenocarpus argyrophyllus was the model species
    selected to explore our hypotheses by analysing the: (a) influence of scarification
    treatments; (b) seedling emergence during 5 years after dry heat scarification
    of freshly matured seeds, and evaluating intrapopulation variation; (c) seedling
    emergence after dry heat scarification of seeds rescued from soil; and (d) ability
    to form persistent soil seed banks. Key results. Dry heat scarification of freshly
    matured seeds only resulted in 22.5% germination. However, exposure to pre-sowing
    thermal shock stimulated seedling emergence during the first few years post-planting,
    with high intrapopulation variation. In seeds recovered from soil, thermal shock
    before reseeding increased the seedling emergence rate. Conclusions and implications.
    Our results show that, to avoid incomplete interpretation, studies of thermal
    treatment on the breaking of physical seed dormancy should allow the seeds sufficient
    time to exhibit the complete effects of high temperature treatment, thereby preventing
    underestimation.&lt;/p&gt;'
