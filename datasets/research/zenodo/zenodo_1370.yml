  title: Effect of Soil Flexibility on Building Frame Analysis and Practice in Bangladesh
  abstract: 'To analyze and design multi-story building frames, it is a conventional
    practice that the foundation is fixed but in actuality, the structure is ultimately
    supported on soil that has a flexible characteristic. Typically, during the design
    of the structure, the impact of soil-structure interaction (SSI) is disregarded
    in Bangladesh. This soil''s flexibility may vary according to its characteristics
    of settling loads, variations in the soil strata below the foundation, etc. When
    earthquake loads come, the soil''s flexibility causes at varying rates, which
    influences the design and distribution of the structural forces. The current study
    makes an effort to acknowledge the effect of soil flexibility on the analysis
    and design of moment frame building, especially for earthquake load. To conduct
    this study, structures are modeled using two different approaches: (A) frame without
    soil effect and (B) frame with SSI into account. With the aid of the ETABS program,
    6-storied, 9-storied &amp; 12-storied RCC special moment frame building located
    in seismic zone IV as per BNBC20 is analyzed for different approaches. To assess
    the influence of various characteristics on the behavior of the structure, parametric
    studies are carried out. The system''s natural periods are increased due to the
    soil''s flexibility, which reduces the total stiffness of the building frames
    under the foundation. Also, according to the study, the soil''s flexibility affected
    the structural stresses and impacted the structural analysis, which must be considered
    in the design.'
