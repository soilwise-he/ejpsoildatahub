  title: Analysis of the performance of grounding grids buried in heterogeneous soil
    under impulse current
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The article presents the analysis of the transient behaviour
    of grounding grids subjected to impulse lightning current. The TLM including mutual
    coupling between conductors will be applied. The transient behaviour will be assessed
    into complete time domain solution by entombing under homogeneous and stratified
    soil. Different simulations carried out altering, the influence of the grid dimensions,
    the kind of the ground and the current injection point on the grid voltage and
    impedance will be presented. Simulation results will be shown for two extreme
    cases. The current is going to be injected twice. Firstly, in the center of the
    grid. Secondly, in one cormer of the two configuration. Comsequently, the lowest
    transient potential displays in the grid 1x1 when the injuction point is in the
    lower resistivity. Whereas the better behaviour is shown in the grid 2x2 when
    the current is injected at center point. It is obvious that the suggested simulations
    are in a good agreement, with corresponding results of other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;'
