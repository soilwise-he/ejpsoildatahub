  title: Potential Of Selected Microbial Strains To Degrade The Gasoil Of Hydrocarbon
    Polluted Soil
  abstract: Although oil-based drilling fluids are of paramount practical and economical
    interest, they represent a serious source of pollution, once released into the
    environment as drill cuttings. The aim of this study is to assess the capability
    of isolated microorganisms to degrade gasoil fuel. The commonly used physicochemical
    and biodegradation remediation techniques of petroleum contaminated soil were
    both investigated. The study revealed that natural biodegradation is favorable.
    Even though, the presence of heavy metals, the moisture level of (8.55%) and nutrient
    deficiencies put severe constrains on microorganisms- survival ranges inhibiting
    the biodegradation process. The selected strains were able to degrade the diesel
    fuel at significantly high rates (around 98%).
