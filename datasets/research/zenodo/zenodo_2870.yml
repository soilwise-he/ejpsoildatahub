  title: 'Modelling Soil Co2 Production And Transport With Dynamic Source And Diffusion
    Terms: Testing The Steady-State Assumption Using Detect V1.0'
  abstract: Our work evaluated the appropriateness of the common steady-state (SS)
    assumption, for example when partitioning soil respiration of CO<sub>2</sub> into
    recently photosynthesized carbon (C) and older C.  Using a new model of soil CO2
    production and transport we found that the SS assumption is valid most of the
    time, especially in sand/silt soils.  Non-SS conditions occurred mainly for the
    few days following large rain event in all soil types, but the non-SS period was
    prolonged and magnified in clay soils.
