  title: Influence of Plastic Waste Reinforcement on Compaction and Consolidation
    Behavior of Silty Soil
  abstract: In recent decades, the amount of solid waste production has been rising.
    In the meantime, plastic waste is one of the major parts of urban solid waste,
    so, recycling plastic waste from water bottles has become a serious challenge
    in the whole world. The experimental program includes the study of the effect
    of waste plastic fibers on maximum dry density (MDD), optimum moisture content
    (OMC) with different sizes and contents. Also, one dimensional consolidation tests
    were carried out to evaluate the benefit of utilizing randomly distributed waste
    plastics fiber to improve the engineering behavior of a tested soils. Silty soil
    specimens were prepared and tested at five different percentages of plastic waste
    content (i.e. 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, 1% and 1.25% by weight of the parent soil).
    The size of plastic chips used, are 4 mm, 8 mm and 12 mm long and 4 mm in width.
    The results show that with the addition of waste plastic fibers, the MDD and OMC
    and also the compressibility of soil decrease significantly.
