  title: Human Health Risk Assessment From Metals Present In A Soil Contaminated By
    Crude Oil
  abstract: "The main sources of soil pollution due to petroleum contaminants are\
    \ industrial processes involve crude oil. Soil polluted with crude oil is toxic\
    \ for plants, animals, and humans. Human exposure to the contaminated soil occurs\
    \ through different exposure pathways: Soil ingestion, diet, inhalation, and dermal\
    \ contact. The present study research is focused on soil contamination with heavy\
    \ metals as a consequence of soil pollution with petroleum products. Human exposure\
    \ pathways considered are: Accidentally ingestion of contaminated soil and dermal\
    \ contact. The purpose of the paper is to identify the human health risk (carcinogenic\
    \ risk) from soil contaminated with heavy metals. The human exposure and risk\
    \ were evaluated for five contaminants of concern of the eleven which were identified\
    \ in soil. Two soil samples were collected from a bioremediation platform from\
    \ Muntenia Region of Romania. The soil deposited on the bioremediation platform\
    \ was contaminated through extraction and oil processing. For the research work,\
    \ two average soil samples from two different plots were analyzed: The first one\
    \ was slightly contaminated with petroleum products (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons\
    \ (TPH) in soil was 1420 mg/kg<sub>d.w.</sub>), while the second one was highly\
    \ contaminated (TPH in soil was 24306 mg/kg<sub>d.w.</sub>). In order to evaluate\
    \ risks posed by heavy metals due soil pollution with petroleum products, five\
    \ metals known as carcinogenic were investigated: Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd),\
    \ Chromium<sup>VI</sup> (Cr<sup>VI</sup>), Nickel (Ni), and Lead (Pb). Results\
    \ of the chemical analysis performed on samples collected from the contaminated\
    \ soil evidence soil contamination with heavy metals as following: As in Site\
    \ 1 = 6.96 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>; As in Site 2 = 11.62 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>, Cd in\
    \ Site 1 = 0.9 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>; Cd in Site 2 = 1 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>; Cr<sup>VI</sup>\
    \ was 0.1 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub> for both sites; Ni in Site 1 = 37.00 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>;\
    \ Ni in Site 2 = 42.46 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>; Pb in Site 1 = 34.67 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>;\
    \ Pb in Site 2 = 120.44 mg/kg<sub>d.w</sub>. The concentrations for these metals\
    \ exceed the normal values established in the Romanian regulation, but are smaller\
    \ than the alert level for a less sensitive use of soil (industrial). Although,\
    \ the concentrations do not exceed the thresholds, the next step was to assess\
    \ the human health risk posed by soil contamination with these heavy metals. Results\
    \ for risk were compared with the acceptable one (10<sup>-6</sup>, according to\
    \ World Human Organization). As, expected, the highest risk was identified for\
    \ the soil with a higher degree of contamination: Individual Risk (IR) was 1.11\xD7\
    10<sup>-5 </sup>compared with 8.61\xD710<sup>-6</sup>."
