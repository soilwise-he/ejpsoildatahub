  title: Zero-valent iron nanoparticles and organic amendment assisted rhizoremediation
    of mixed contaminated soil using Brassica napus
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Soil is one of our most important natural resources. Regrettably, the
    expansion of human activities has resulted in the degradation of the soil resource
    due to contamination with a myriad of organic and inorganic compounds. The remediation
    of mixed contaminated soils, i.e. soils contaminated with both organic compounds
    and metals, is challenging as it requires actions to simultaneously decrease metal-induced
    risks and organic contaminant concentrations. Here, we evaluated the effect of
    the addition of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nanoremediation) and organic amendments
    (biostimulation) on the rhizoremediation, using Brassica napus plants, of soil
    simultaneously contaminated with zinc (2500 mg kg&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    and lindane (100 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;). We used a factorial design
    with three factors (amendment, nZVI, plant) to evaluate the impact of the applied
    remediation actions on lindane and extractable Zn concentrations, as well as on
    soil health recovery as manifested by the values of different soil microbial indicators.
    The studied microbial indicators were not negatively affected by nZVI application.
    The application of nZVI was the most effective factor regarding the targeted reduction
    in lindane concentration (51% average reduction in nZVI treated soils). The highest
    reduction in extractable Zn was achieved in the presence of B. napus, nZVI and
    organic amendments (99 and 95% reduction in horse manure-amended and sewage sludge-amended
    soils, respectively). The combination of the three factors led to the highest
    values of soil microbial indicators (although a significant triple interaction
    was not observed for all parameters), especially when combined with horse manure
    amendment: in this case, prokaryotic richness increased by 64%, respiration by
    376%, eukaryotic abundance by 333%, and prokaryotic abundance by 437%, compared
    to untreated soils. The combination of remediation approaches (rhizoremediation
    with B. napus, nanoremediation with nZVI, biostimulation with organic amendments)
    can help overcome the limitations of each individual strategy. &copy; 2022 The
