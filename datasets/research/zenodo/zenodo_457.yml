  title: EFFECT OF SOIL ON NURSERY-GROWN WALNUT PLANTS
  abstract: This experiment evaluates the effect of two soil types viz. an alluvial
    loamy deposit and a leached vertisol on survival, percentage of firstclass plants,
    growth and diameter of nursery-grown grafted walnut. Plants grown on the alluvial
    loamy deposit showed higher rate of survival at the end of the first growing season
    and increase in percentage of first-class plants at the end of the second season
    compared to plants grown on leached vertisol. The average growth and diameter
    of plants on the alluvial loamy deposit increased<br> at the end of the first
    and second growing season compared to plants grown on leached vertisol.
