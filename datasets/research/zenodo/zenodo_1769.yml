  title: Vulnerability of Potential Soil Erosion and Risk Assessment at Hilly Farms
    using InSAR Technology
  abstract: "Soil erosion is a serious environmental challenge which is persistently\
    \ diminishing the available land resource in many places around the world, particularly\
    \ the highlands areas. The traditional approach of estimating the magnitude of\
    \ erosion is tedious, costly, and considerably time consuming. This study is aimed\
    \ at assessing the risk level associated with soil erosion at hilly areas of Cameron\
    \ Highlands through Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The digital\
    \ elevation model with 5 m resolution was utilized to generate the slope map for\
    \ the highlands. Soil erosion rates was estimated using universal soil loss equation,\
    \ while information about land use and cover were sourced from relevant government\
    \ agencies. The analysis shows that, there was about 217.5 km2 (30.5%) of highlands\
    \ fall under severely steep zone with slope \u2265 45-degree. Moreover, erosion\
    \ risk assessment indicated that; 66.3%, 11.4%, 11.7% and 10.8% of the severe\
    \ sloppy lands are classified as very low to high susceptible to soil erosion\
    \ respectively. In general, the risk of soil erosion is relatively low and could\
    \ be attributed to large vegetation coverage despite steep slopes. However, there\
    \ is need to deploy a control measures to reduce soil disturbance activities on\
    \ highlands with extremely steep slope as a proactive measures to minimize the\
    \ effect of potential soil erosion."
