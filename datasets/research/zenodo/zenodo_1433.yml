  title: Performance of Soilwat Model for Soil Physical Properties Simulation in Auchi,
    Edo State
  abstract: "<strong>The physical properties of soils are dominant factors affecting\
    \ the use of a soil which determine the availability of O<sub>2</sub> in soils,\
    \ the mobility of water into and through soils and case of root penetration and\
    \ also the chemical and biological behavior of soil. The aim of this paper was\
    \ to investigate the performance of soil physical properties data that was OILWAT\
    \ model in the prediction of soil physical properties adapted from previous study\
    \ in the Department of Agricultural and Bio-Environmental Engineering Technology.\
    \ SOILWAT performed poorly in simulating volumetric moisture content, the equation\
    \ of the line obtained is y = 0.0403x + 15.428, with the R\xB2 = 0.0274, the RMSE\
    \ value is 4.21 which is quite large compare to the model\u2019s ability to simulate\
    \ bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity. When compared with the measured\
    \ data, SOILWAT significantly simulated Bulk Density (BD) for Sandy loam and sandy\
    \ clay loam soil having a perfect agreement between the observed and simulated\
    \ values (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90, p&lt;0.05; RMSE of 0.033 and regression equation\
    \ given as; y = x \u2013 0.33). The model significantly predicted the Saturated\
    \ hydraulic conductivity, with R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.92 and root mean square\
    \ error (RMSE) 0.03, the equation of best fit obtained is y = x+0.21, since sample\
    \ environment (confinement and overburden) are not represented in laboratory procedures,\
    \ laboratory data may not always agree with field data.</strong>"
