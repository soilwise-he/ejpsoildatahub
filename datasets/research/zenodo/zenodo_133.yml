  title: Soil Apparent Electrical Conductivity Sensor Data For Estimation Of Ci-Based
    Soil Compaction Status
  abstract: 'Regionalization of soil properties is very important for successful site-specific
    field management. Soil compaction is a critical issue to be detected and managed
    due to its effects on crop growth. Soil compaction has been conventionally quantified
    as cone index (CI) measured by an ASABE-standard cone penetrometer, but this approach
    has limited capability of obtaining the spatially-dense data required for precision
    agriculture. A significant amount of past research has related CI with apparent
    soil electrical conductivity (ECa), and recently the potential of ECa to estimate
    subsoil compaction status through the stress-at-rest-coefficient (K0), defined
    as the ratio of normal compaction and pre-compaction, was introduced. The objective
    of this study was to explore the potential of relating K0 with ECa using data
    obtained from sites with wide ranges of soil texture, bulk density, and water
    content, properties that significantly affect both CI and ECa. The following data
    was collected from<br>

    35 sites in Missouri and Illinois fields: CI profile up to 75 cm with a 5-cm interval,
    ECa measured by EM38 and Veris devices, and depth-dependent soil properties such
    as soil texture, bulk density, and water content. First, K0 values were calculated
    from CI profiles by depth and related to ECa measurements. Then, effects of the
    soil properties on the relationships between K0 and ECa were investigated. Results
    of this study will provide insights on the effects of soil properties on soil
    compaction, and on the potential to use ECa to estimate the status of soil compaction.'
