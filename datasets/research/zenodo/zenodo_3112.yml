  title: Activity And Subsellular Localization Of Isoforms Of Superoxide Dismutase,
    Accumulation Of Glycine Betaine And Malondialdehyde In Wheat Genotypes Subjected
    To Continuous Soil Drought
  abstract: Drought resistance is provided by multicomponent antioxidant system, causing
    rearrangements at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. Experiments
    with two durum (Triticum durum Desf.) wheat genotypes with contrasting drought
    tolerance were carried out to study the effect of soil drought on changes in activities
    and subcellular localization of isoforms of superoxide dismutase, levels of malondoaldehyde,
    glycine betaine and total protein content. The level of the enzyme activity appeared
    to depend on the wheat genotypes, duration of drought and stages of the plant
    growth. Wheat responds to water deficit through accumulation of glycine betaine
    in leaves. Significant accumulation of MDA occurred in the sensitive variety Gragylchig-2
    contrary to the tolerant Barakatli-95 under severe stress conditions. Native polyacrylamide
    gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed the presence of 9 isoforms of superoxide dismutase
    in wheat leaves during drought. Wheat leaves contain three different types of
    SODs (Mn-, Fe-, Cu/Zn-SOD) Mn-SOD was found in the mitochondrial fractions, Fe-SOD
    in the chloroplast fraction and Cu/Zn-SOD is localized in all subcellular fractions.
    The long-term drought was accompanied by the expression of the levels of these
    isoforms. Three isoforms of Mn-SOD, one isoform of Fe-SOD and five of Cu/Zn-SOD
    were observed in wheat leaves using 3mM KCN and 5 mM H2O2 as selective inhibitors.
    Mn-SOD was established to make the most contribution to increase of SOD activity.
    It seems that this isoform plays a major role in the scavenging of superoxide
    radicals during a longterm drought.
