  title: Effects of Landscape Slope Position, Urban Refuse Compost and Sewage Sludge
    on Soil Properties and Cassava Yield in South Eastern Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Understanding the effects of landscape slope position and organic\
    \ waste residues on soil properties and cassava yield is a critical component\
    \ of site-specific management. A field study was conducted in an Ultisol at Nsukka,\
    \ southeastern Nigeria to investigate the effects of landscape slope positions\
    \ and two organic waste residues (urban refuse compost and sewage sludge) on soil\
    \ properties and cassava yield. The treatment consisted of two landscape slope\
    \ positions, two organic waste residues, and a control; arranged in a split \u2013\
    \ plot design in RCBD. The two slope positions - mid slope (26%) and toe slope\
    \ (5%) occupied the main\u2013plot, while organic residues at the rate of 50%\
    \ inorganic nitrogen fertilizer requirement of cassava and a control were the\
    \ sub-plot treatment. The result obtained from this study showed that slope position\
    \ significantly (p&lt;0.05) influenced the soil properties after harvest. The\
    \ toe-slope soil was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in dry bulk density, water\
    \ holding capacity, field capacity moisture content and more resistant to mound\
    \ dispersion by rain drops. The mid-slope soil was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher\
    \ in percent water stable aggregates. There was significant difference (p&lt;0.05)\
    \ between the non-amended plots and the organic wastes amended plots in respect\
    \ of aggregate stability as measured by percent water stable aggregate (% WSA)\
    \ index. Post-harvest soil analysis revealed that plots amended with urban refuse\
    \ compost (UR) and sewage sludge (SS) did not differ significantly in their pH,\
    \ total porosity, bulk density, water holding capacity, field capacity moisture\
    \ content, saturated hydraulic conductivity and mound dispersion as measured by\
    \ length of exposed nail. Weed infestation, fresh shoot and root yield were significantly\
    \ (p&gt;0.05) higher at the toe slope position. However, percent survival was\
    \ significantly (p&gt;0.05) higher at mid slope position. Significant interactions\
    \ of the slope positions and organic residues were observed in bulk density, total\
    \ porosity and fresh root yield. The highest fresh cassava root yield of 11.63\
    \ tha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of the study was obtained in plots amended with\
    \ urban refuse compost under the toe slope position. Urban refuse compost had\
    \ the least fresh root yield per hectare (1.32 tha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) when\
    \ applied in midslope landscape position but highest (11.63 tha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ when applied in toe-slope landscape position.&lt;/p&gt;"
