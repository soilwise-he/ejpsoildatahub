  title: Effect of Calcium Peroxide on Seedling Emergence of IR36 From Puddled Soil
    At Different Temperatures
  abstract: This article 'Effect of Calcium Peroxide on Seedling Emergence of IR36
    From Puddled Soil At Different Temperatures' appeared in the International Rice
    Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
