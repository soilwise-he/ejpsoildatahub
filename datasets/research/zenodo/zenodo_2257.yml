  title: Tillage, sole and intercrop systems and soil amendment influence on sorghum
    grain and stover nutrient levels
  abstract: Sorghum [<em>Sorghum bicolor</em> (L) Moench) is a major grain crop in
    Burkina Faso. A three-year experiment was conducted in the Sudanian zone to determine
    the combined effects of tillage methods (T) and cropping systems with different
    soil amendments (CS/SA) on plant nutrient concentrations and related this to human
    and cattle nutrient requirements. The analysis of variance indicated that tillage,
    soil amendment nor cropping system affected the stover nutrient concentration
    of grain sorghum. Nitrogen, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn and Cu concentrations in grain
    were all influenced by the Y x T interaction largely due to increased nutrient
    concentrations for no-till in 2012 and tied ridges in 2013. As grain yield increased,
    grain N, Ca, Mg and Mn concentrations decreased while P and Zn increased. Grain
    N, P, Mg, S, Fe and Zn concentrations met human nutritional requirements, while
    K, Ca, Mn and Cu were deficient and merited supplementation. Nutrient gross means
    indicated that cattle nutrient requirements were met for N, P, Mg, Fe and Zn,
    but low for K, Ca, S, Mn and Cu. Tillage, CS/SA and Y had no or small effects
    on the nutrient concentrations of sorghum grain and stover. The agroecological
    zones in 2012 and 2013 indicated most nutrients to be adequate for human and cattle
    diets, but not for K, Ca, Mn and Cu.
