  title: Climatic and pedoclimatic factors driving C and N dynamics in soil and surface
    water in the alpine tundra (NW-Italian Alps)
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;In alpine tundra the interannual and seasonal variability of\
    \ C and N forms in soil and lake water during the short snow-free season could\
    \ be significant and related to climatic and pedoclimatic variables. The hypothesis\
    \ that not only the climatic and pedoclimatic parameters recorded during the summer\
    \ season but also the ones measured during the previous snow-covered season could\
    \ contribute to explaining the C and N dynamics in soil and surface water was\
    \ tested along 10 snow-free seasons in 3 sites in the alpine tundra in the north-western\
    \ Italian Alps (LTER site Istituto Mosso). Among the considered parameters, the\
    \ snow cover duration (SCD) exerted a primary control on soil N-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,\
    \ DOC, C&lt;sub&gt;micr&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;micr&lt;/sub&gt; and DOC:DON\
    \ ratio, with an inverse relationship. A long SCD might cause the consumption\
    \ of all the subnival substrata by the soil microorganisms, determining a C starvation\
    \ during the subsequent snow-free season. An opposite trend was observed for the\
    \ lake water, where a longer SCD corresponded to a higher content of inorganic\
    \ N forms. Among the pedoclimatic indices, the number of soil freeze/thaw cycles\
    \ (FTC) recorded during the snow-covered season had a positive relation with most\
    \ of soil C and N forms and N-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ in lake water. Only the soil DON showed an inverse pattern, and this result\
    \ is consistent with the hypothesis that FTC released soil DON, subsequently decomposed\
    \ and mineralized. Only N-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ had a significant intraseasonal variability, reaching the highest values in\
    \ September both in soil and water, revealing a significant slowdown of the contribution\
    \ of soil N immobilization processes.&lt;/p&gt;"
