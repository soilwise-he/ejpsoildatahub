  title: Assessment of Sewage Sludge and Coir Pith as Alternative Cover Materials
    to Red Soil in Bioreactor Landfills
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; This study assessed the performance
    of sewage sludge and coir pith as a potential alternative to virgin red soil as
    cover material in bioreactor landfills. Three field scale models of anaerobic
    bioreactor landfills were set up so as to study the performance of the cover materials
    on leachate generation time, quality and quantity. In one reactor (R1), red soil
    was used as the cover and was kept as control. In the other two reactors (R2 and
    R3), modified sewage sludge and coir pith were used as the cover materials, respectively.
    The leachate produced from each were analyzed based on its quality (Total Solids,
    pH, BOD, COD, Nitrate and Iron), quantity and generation time. Red soil provided
    respectively 41.08% and 25.5% reduction in BOD than modified sewage sludge and
    coir pith. However, coir pith showed better performance in reduction of leachate
    quantity, total solids, nitrate and iron, thus making it suitable for use as an
    alternate cover material.&lt;/p&gt;'
