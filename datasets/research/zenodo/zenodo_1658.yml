  title: Observation of the Behavior of Organic Soil by Adding Lime, Fly Ash and Cement
  abstract: Organic soil is a kind of soil that contains organic matter. Soil organic
    matter (SOM) is that kind of organic matter of soil, which consists of different
    ingredients such as plants, animal residues, cells and tissues of soil etc. at
    various stages of decomposition. Normally organic soils are rich in water content
    with high porosity and therefore successful stabilization has to depend on the
    type and amount of binder added. The commonly used binders are lime, fly ash and
    cement. This study reveals the variation of behavior of organic soil-lime, organic
    soil- fly ash and organic soil-cement mixtures at an amount of 5%, 10%, 15% and
    20 %. The maximum shear stress and maximum angle of friction were found for 10%
    cement mixed with soil.
