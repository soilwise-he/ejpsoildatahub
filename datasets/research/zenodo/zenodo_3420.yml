  title: Impact Of Interface Soil Layer On Groundwater Aquifer Behaviour
  abstract: "The geological environment where the groundwater is collected represents\
    \ the most important element that affects the behaviour of groundwater aquifer.\
    \ As groundwater is a worldwide vital resource, it requires knowing the parameters\
    \ that affect this source accurately so that the conceptualized mathematical models\
    \ would be acceptable to the broadest ranges. Therefore, groundwater models have\
    \ recently become an effective and efficient tool to investigate groundwater aquifer\
    \ behaviours. Groundwater aquifer may contain aquitards, aquicludes, or interfaces\
    \ within its geological formations. Aquitards and aquicludes have geological formations\
    \ that forced the modellers to include those formations within the conceptualized\
    \ groundwater models, while interfaces are commonly neglected from the conceptualization\
    \ process because the modellers believe that the interface has no effect on aquifer\
    \ behaviour. The current research highlights the impact of an interface existing\
    \ in a real unconfined groundwater aquifer called Dibdibba, located in Al-Najaf\
    \ City, Iraq where it has a river called the Euphrates River that passes through\
    \ the eastern part of this city. Dibdibba groundwater aquifer consists of two\
    \ types of soil layers separated by an interface soil layer. A groundwater model\
    \ is built for Al-Najaf City to explore the impact of this interface. Calibration\
    \ process is done using PEST 'Parameter ESTimation' approach and the best Dibdibba\
    \ groundwater model is obtained. When the soil interface is conceptualized, results\
    \ show that the groundwater tables are significantly affected by that interface\
    \ through appearing dry areas of 56.24 km\xB2 and 6.16 km\xB2 in the upper and\
    \ lower layers of the aquifer, respectively. The Euphrates River will also leak\
    \ water into the groundwater aquifer of 7359 m\xB3/day. While these results are\
    \ changed when the soil interface is neglected where the dry area became 0.16\
    \ km\xB2, the Euphrates River leakage became 6334 m\xB3/day. In addition, the\
    \ conceptualized models (with and without interface) reveal different responses\
    \ for the change in the recharge rates applied on the aquifer through the uncertainty\
    \ analysis test. The aquifer of Dibdibba in Al-Najaf City shows a slight deficit\
    \ in the amount of water supplied by the current pumping scheme and also notices\
    \ that the Euphrates River suffers from stresses applied to the aquifer. Ultimately,\
    \ this study shows a crucial need to represent the interface soil layer in model\
    \ conceptualization to be the intended and future predicted behaviours more reliable\
    \ for consideration purposes."
