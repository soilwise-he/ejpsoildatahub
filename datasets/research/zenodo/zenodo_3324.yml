  title: Determination of Deltamethrin &amp; Dimethoate in Tea Soil
  abstract: "\u2014 Tea plantations prefers to grow best in acidic soil conditions\
    \ and they are subjected to ravages of insects, mites, plant pathogens, nematodes,\
    \ caterpillar, termites and beetles. Pesticide is an important agricultural input\
    \ for controlling array of pest complex in tea crop. The pesticides during its\
    \ spray on tea bushes can enter the ecosystem by leaching into soil. An experiment\
    \ was undertaken to assess the behaviour of deltamethrin and dimethoate in tea\
    \ soil followed by its comparative laboratory study. The results for dimethoate\
    \ revealed that residue decline during wet season (not detected on 5th day after\
    \ spray) could be due to moist soil while during dry season (0.31-0.04-Treatment\
    \ 1 and 0.60-0.06- Treatment (2 on 7th day) the loss in dimethoate concentration\
    \ from the soil surface could be attributed to evaporation from dry soil surface.\
    \ For deltamethrin the sunlight might have accelerated the decline during dry\
    \ season (1.02-0.05-T1 and 1.95-0.28- T2 on 3rd day after spray).Further, during\
    \ wet season, the residue loss was 0.19-0.06-T1 and 0.30-0.10-T2) high soil water\
    \ partitioning indicated a relatively low potential for loss due to volatilization.\
    \ The results obtained in field studies were further confirmed by laboratory studies\
    \ which explained the effect of temperature, photo degradation and soil pH on\
    \ the pesticide under study."
