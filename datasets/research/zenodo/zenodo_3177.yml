  title: The effects of fertilization with anaerobic, composted and pelletized sewage
    sludge on soil cations and pasture production in a silvopastoral system under
    Quercus rubra L.
  abstract: In Europe, sewage sludge has to be stabilized before being used as fertilizer
    in agriculture. Depending on the stabilization process that is used, sewage sludge
    has different characteristics, nutrient contents and soil nutrient incorporation
    rates. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of municipal sewage sludge stabilized
    using anaerobic digestion, composting and pelletization on saturation percentage
    of cations in the soil exchange complex and pasture production compared with control
    treatments (mineral and no fertilization) in a silvopastoral system established
    under Quercus rubra L. in Galicia (Spain). The application of the dose of pelletized
    sewage sludge in several times implied an increase of pasture production in the
    understory which reduced the Ca saturated percentage in the soil exchange complex
    and therefore increased the Al saturated percentage compared with the other types
    of sewage sludge evaluated.
