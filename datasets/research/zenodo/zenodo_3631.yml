  title: 'Modal identification of freeway overcrossings with soil-structure interaction:
    a case study: MODAL IDENTIFICATION OF FREEWAY OVERCROSSINGS'
  abstract: "This paper is concerned with a widely studied problem\u2014that of the\
    \ identification of the modal characteristics of freeway overcrossings and other\
    \ bridges, which response is interacting with their approaching embankments and\
    \ their foundation. The study implements a sophisticated parameter estimation\
    \ method known as the prediction error method and examines in detail the sensitivity\
    \ of the modal characteristics (frequency and damping) of the bridge when the\
    \ input signals are taken at the free field, at the approaching embankments and\
    \ pile caps, and on the abutments and the pile caps. The findings of this case\
    \ study on the Meloland Road Overcrossing with the prediction error method are\
    \ compared with the results from past system identification studies and the results\
    \ from finite element analyses, which examined in depth the contribution of the\
    \ approaching embankments in the bridge response. The study concludes that despite\
    \ the appreciable energy dissipation capability of the approaching embankments\
    \ the concrete bridge structure, while interacting mechanically with the embankments,\
    \ remains small."
