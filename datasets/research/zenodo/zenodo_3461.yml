  title: Soil Properties After Plowing With Vertical And Horizontal Axis Rotavator
  abstract: In this research, performance of rotavator with horizontal rotary axis
    and vertical rotary axis has been evaluated and compared. The mean weight diameter
    (MWD), cross-sectional area disturbed and cone index of soil investigated. Factorial
    experiments based on a randomized complete block with 18 treatments, three different
    velocities 2.2, 3.5, 6.1 km/h; three different depth of 5, 10, 15cm and with two
    rotary plows horizontal axis and vertical axis with three replications were used.
    Result showed that maximum MWD in 6.1 km/h and 15cm of depth were 55.6 and 52.5mm
    for horizontal axis rotavator, respectively. The minimum MWD in 2.2 km/h and 5cm
    of depth for vertical axis rotavator were 34.9 and 35.1mm, respectively. The values
    of cone index 1861.1 and 2339.5 kPa for vertical axis rotavator and horizontal
    axis rotavator were obtained, respectively, also the values of cross-sectional
    area disturbed 687 and 497.2cm<sup>2</sup> for vertical axis rotavator and horizontal
    axis rotavator were obtained, respectively.
