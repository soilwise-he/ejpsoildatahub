  title: 112 Years Since the Foundation of Soil Science and 110 Years Since the Foundation
    of the Soil Institute in Bulgaria
  abstract: Historical soil science is called to analyze and evaluate realistically
    and critically the role of important dates and discoveries that determine the
    further development of soil science. Of particular importance for soil science
    is the first scientific and fundamental work of N. Pushkarov "Formation of the
    soil", published 112 years ago. With the present work an analysis of the natural
    and philosophical-dialectical interpretations of his work related to the genesis
    of the soil is made. Pushkarov applies the genetic approach to the study of soils
    and refutes the so-called. agro-geological (geological) approach, which dominated
    at that time in world soil science. He makes an accurate and objective general
    assessment of the factors and conditions of soil formation and proves new knowledge
    of methodical and fundamental nature, which is applied in further research in
    the country. At the same time, facts are presented about the soil science or agro-geological
    section established by him in 1911, which performs the tasks for soil-cartographic
    research formulated by him. All this gives grounds to conclude that in 1909 N.
    Pushkarov laid the foundations of soil science in Bulgaria, and in 1911 he established
    a scientific-administrative unit (scientific organization at the section level)
    and laid the foundations of the Institute of Soil Science.
