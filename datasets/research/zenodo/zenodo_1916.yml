  title: "Soil moisture variation on the outlet area of devices dewatering forest\
    \ roads in Beskid S\u0105decki"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Water run-off &ndash; a natural part of water circulation in
    the natural environment &ndash; is a harmful and undesired phenomenon for humans.
    The most spectacular and most serious one is its erosive activity. In adverse
    conditions, such a runoff has high energy, it causes serious reshaping of a terrain
    and it destroys the natural environment and infrastructure. In the forest environment,
    a run-off process occurs basically on roads, skidding trails and in log storage
    sites, which are areas with soil cover properties changed by humans. The devices
    used for dehydrating a transport system direct water collected in the form of
    concentrated streams to a slope, which frequently causes serious linear damage
    or landslides. The objective of the tests carried out was to determine the spatial
    distribution of soil moisture on the area behind the outlet of devices dehydrating
    forest roads within the context of changes in selected soil properties affecting
    a risk of landslide formation.&lt;br&gt;

    The tests included four water drains dehydrating a forest slope road with a soil
    surface. In the area located behind the outlet, according to the model accepted,
    soil samples were collected for testing a current moisture value, determining
    grain composition and a hydraulic conductivity coefficient, calculated based on
    the simplified Hazen formula.&lt;br&gt;

    There were significant differences in the soil moisture means in the three-measurement
    series conducted; nevertheless, the highest moisture means were obtained after
    the lowest precipitation, and the lowest moisture means were obtained after the
    highest precipitation. It applies to all water drains observed, separately and
    collectively. Average moisture measures in all dehydrating facilities differed
    among one another, although in different sessions, this dependence was observed
    in various facility pairs. The statistical analysis did not demonstrate any significant
    differences in moisture in terms of the distance of moisture testing location
    from the road edge, or in locations with different distances from the water run-off
    line behind the outlet of dehydrating devices. Significant differences could be
    observed in the analysis of average moisture values in the soil layers.&lt;br&gt;

    Such an analysis result could be explained by a relatively low soil permeability
    and low slope gradient on the area examined. Usually, a few percent fluctuation
    in soil moisture, despite precipitation diversity, in combination with a high
    amount of granular soil structure, does not create conditions facilitating the
    formation of landslides.&lt;/p&gt;'
