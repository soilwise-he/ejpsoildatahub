  title: Modelling Of Soil Erosion By Non Conventional Methods
  abstract: 'Soil erosion is the most serious problem faced at

    global and local level. So planning of soil conservation measures has

    become prominent agenda in the view of water basin managers. To

    plan for the soil conservation measures, the information on soil

    erosion is essential. Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised

    Universal Soil Loss Equation 1 (RUSLE1or RUSLE) and Modified

    Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), RUSLE 1.06, RUSLE1.06c,

    RUSLE2 are most widely used conventional erosion estimation

    methods. The essential drawbacks of USLE, RUSLE1 equations are

    that they are based on average annual values of its parameters and so

    their applicability to small temporal scale is questionable. Also these

    equations do not estimate runoff generated soil erosion. So

    applicability of these equations to estimate runoff generated soil

    erosion is questionable. Data used in formation of USLE, RUSLE1

    equations was plot data so its applicability at greater spatial scale

    needs some scale correction factors to be induced. On the other hand

    MUSLE is unsuitable for predicting sediment yield of small and large

    events. Although the new revised forms of USLE like RUSLE 1.06,

    RUSLE1.06c and RUSLE2 were land use independent and they have

    almost cleared all the drawbacks in earlier versions like USLE and

    RUSLE1, they are based on the regional data of specific area and

    their applicability to other areas having different climate, soil, land

    use is questionable. These conventional equations are applicable for

    sheet and rill erosion and unable to predict gully erosion and spatial

    pattern of rills. So the research was focused on development of nonconventional

    (other than conventional) methods of soil erosion

    estimation. When these non-conventional methods are combined with

    GIS and RS, gives spatial distribution of soil erosion. In the present

    paper the review of literature on non- conventional methods of soil

    erosion estimation supported by GIS and RS is presented.'
