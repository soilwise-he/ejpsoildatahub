  title: Means For Mechanization For Sites And Solid Residue In Soil
  abstract: "The article analyzes and describes the technical soil\u2013cultivating\
    \ means of the rotor type, which ensures the grinding of biomass with its incorporation\
    \ into the soil to the required depth. The advantages and disadvantages of the\
    \ work of technical rotary\u2013type soil\u2013cultivating equipment have been\
    \ revealed and described. The results of the economic verification of perspective\
    \ models of rotor implements with the active drive of working elements are presented."
