  title: Integrating Soil Nutrients and Location Weather Variables for Crop Yield
    Prediction
  abstract: '- This study is described as a recommendation<br> system that utilize
    data from Agricultural development<br> program (ADP) Kogi State chapters of Nigeria
    and<br> employs machine learning approach to recommend<br> suitable crops to be
    planted according to input soil and<br> climate statistics. The purpose of this
    study is to forecast<br> agricultural production using machine learning<br> techniques.
    The inferred classifier models here<br> incorporate information from Random forest<br>
    classifier,Gradient boost and Keras Regressor with<br> Gradient boost exhibiting
    the greatest accuracy of 98.9%.<br> Forecasts made by machine learning algorithms
    can now<br> assist farmers in choosing which plant to cultivate based<br> on key
    variables, including temperature, rainfall, and pH<br> and soil nutrients as nitrogen,
    phosphorous and<br> potassium. Therefore, this strategy lessens the financial<br>
    losses that farmers experience when they decide to plant<br> the improper crops.
    It also helps farmers in their search<br> for new crop varieties that are suitable
    for cultivation in<br> their region.<br>'
