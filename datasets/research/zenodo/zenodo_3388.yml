  title: Soil Organic Carbon Stock Estimation Based on Digital Map of Organic Carbon
    Stock in 30-cm Soil Layer of Russia
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> Digital map of organic carbon stock in 30-cm\
    \ soil layer of Russia was created within the frameworks of FAO UN project \"\
    Global Soil Organic Carbon Map\" (GSOC17). Our objective was to develop and test\
    \ algorithms for soil organic carbon stock (SOC) mapping on the basis of information\
    \ accumulated in the Information System \u201CSoil-Geographic Database of Russia\u201D\
    , i.e. vectorized soil maps, analytical characteristics of reference profiles\
    \ and results of monitoring surveys. Calculations of the basic SOC map have performed\
    \ in the form of synthesis of two types of source data: a map of the entire territory\
    \ of Russia based on the Soil Map of RSFSR at the scale of 1:2.5 M (ed. V.M. Fridland,\
    \ 1988) combined with irregular grid of about 2000 soil profiles and maps of several\
    \ agricultural regions based on the large- and medium-scale soil maps and a dense\
    \ grid of regular soil observations. Both maps were merged in one layer by superimposing\
    \ more detailed maps over the map of entire territory. The SOC map for forest\
    \ litter was calculated on the base of previously published map adapted to the\
    \ GSOC17 requirements. The SOC map for muck and peaty horizons of semihydromorphic\
    \ soils was calculated by using the averaged and expert estimations of stock values.\
    \ The final version of the SOC map of Russia is a per pixel sum of all above maps.\
    \ Our calculations indicate that the total carbon stock in 30-cm soil layer of\
    \ Russia is about 150 Pg, and nearly half of this stock (45%) is concentrated\
    \ in organogenic horizons."
