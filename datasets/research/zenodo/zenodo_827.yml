  title: ISOLATION OF ACTINOBACTERIES FROM THE SOIL FERROSPHERE AND THEIR IDENTIFICATION
  abstract: "Actinobacteria is one of the bacterial groups important in terms of biofilm\
    \ formation. Among them, representatives of <em>Streptomyces</em> sporoactinobacteria,\
    \ some of the most active soil ammonifying bacteria, deserve attention. It is\
    \ known that ammonifying bacteria are involved in microbially induced corrosion\
    \ in the first stages of biofilm formation and form ammonia \u2013 a corrosion-dangerous\
    \ metabolite. However, their diversity in soil ferrosphere remains poorly understood.\
    \ <strong>The purpose</strong> of the work is the isolation of an actinobacterium\
    \ strain from the soil ferrosphere and its identification. The work was carried\
    \ out by conventional <strong>methods:</strong> general biological (preparation\
    \ of mounts \"crushed drop\", stained smears, microscopy), microbiological (preparation\
    \ of medium for the cultivation of bacteria, the method of ten-fold dilutions,\
    \ Koch\u2019s method, seeding microorganisms in a liquid and agar medium, methods\
    \ of staining of cells of bacteria and their structures (staining with fuchsin,\
    \ methylene blue, Gram staining method in Kalina\u2019s modification), methods\
    \ of determining physiological and biochemical properties (tests for catalase,\
    \ oxidase, utilization of citrate, casein, fats, starch, urea, formation of indole,\
    \ ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, MRVP-test, relation to oxygen and temperature), molecular-genetic\
    \ (isolation of DNA from bacterial cells, polymerase chain reaction with primers\
    \ for 16S rRNA gene, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis,\
    \ phylogenetic analysis using GenBank database and MEGA 6.0 computer program).\
    \ <strong>Scientific novelty</strong> \u2013 from the soil ferrosphere is isolated\
    \ a strain of actinobacteria, which by the complex of microbiological, physiological\
    \ and biochemical properties and based on the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene fragment\
    \ (according to the results of phylogenetic analysis) is classified as Streptomyces\
    \ canus. It develops and expands the understanding of the diversity of corrosive\
    \ bacteria and a set of test cultures for the study of microbial-induced corrosion\
    \ processes. <strong>Conclusions</strong> \u2013 according to a number of microbiological,\
    \ physiological, biochemical and genetic characteristics, the NUChC F2 strain\
    \ is classified as <em>Streptomyces</em> and identified as <em>Streptomyces canus</em>.\
    \ The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were registered in the GenBank\
    \ database as <em>Streptomyces \u0441anus</em> MG924748 and MG924855. The isolated\
    \ strain is ammonifying, thus potentially corrosion-active, and can be used in\
    \ the study of microbial-induced corrosion processes. According to the level of\
    \ biosafety, bacteria of the <em>S. canus</em> species belong to the 1st risk\
    \ group (according to the German Technical Rules for biological agents) and are\
    \ safe for human health."
