  title: Growth Test with Lepidium sativum L. for Soil Monitoring of Sites, Part of
    the Bulgarian National Soil Monitoring System
  abstract: 'The publication deals with the application of Lepidium sativum L. biotest
    for the study<br>

    of soils from three sites included in the National Soil Monitoring Network. There
    were no<br>

    exceedances of the limit values of the soil indicators in the monitored sites.
    The obtained<br>

    results presented the existence of strong correlations between the bio test seeds
    and sprouts<br>

    development and the variation in nitrogen content and the concentration of cobalt,
    nickel, zinc<br>

    and copper in the soil. The results of this study have shown some possibilities
    for L. Sativum<br>

    L. usage in soil monitoring, especially for the influence of soil nutrient elements
    (nitrogen)<br>

    and microelements on the plants and thus for determining soil functional capacity
    and ability<br>

    to provide material and support services.'
