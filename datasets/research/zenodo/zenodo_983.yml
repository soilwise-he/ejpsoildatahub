  title: Prediction Models for Estimation of California Bearing Ratio for Cohesive
    Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Cohesive soils are well known for their low strength properties.
    Thus, they are inappropriate for geotechnical works. Soils may be stabilized to
    increase strength and durability. Stabilization with cement is a common treatment
    technology. The present study examines the strength of cement stabilized soil.
    The laboratory tests were carried out in order to study the strength of california
    bearing ratio CBR . Nine clayey soils with different properties were mixed with
    various amounts of cement content 3, 6, 9 and 12 and compacted at the optimum
    moisture content and maximum dry density. Soaked or unsoaked condition of soil
    affects the CBR value. The test results show that unsoaked CBR before stabilization
    ranges between 2.78 and 10.22 which that of its corresponding soaked samples range
    between 1.01 and 9.5 . After stabilization, the values of unsoaked CBR range between
    3.08 and 47 . The maximum values of unsoaked CBR are within 10.8 to 47 . So it
    can be used as sub base condition. The conventional CBR testing method is expensive
    and time consuming. The laboratory test results were used for the development
    of regression based model to predict unsoaked and soaked CBR values for natural
    and cement stabilized soil. Aye Aye Myat | Nyan Myint Kyaw | Htay Win &quot;Prediction
