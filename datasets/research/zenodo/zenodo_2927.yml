  title: Combining ability study of QMM inbred lines for endosperm modification score
    and tryptophan content under low and optimum soil nitrogen environments
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The nutritional benefit of quality protein maize is more demonstrated
    on children who live under nutritional insecurity and also children suffering
    from a severe disease (Kwashiorkor) which is due to protein deficiency. To determine
    the effects of soil nitrogen on combining ability of tryptophan, endosperm modification
    score, protein and protein Quality Index (QI), 121 genotypes with five checks
    were sib-mated to generate F2 grains under low and optimum N environments. Hereafter
    100 grains of each F2 generation were used for endosperm modification scores and
    tryptophan and protein concentration analysis in maize kernel endosperm. The results
    of the study indicated contribution of General Combining Ability (GCA), Specific
    Combining Ability (SCA) and reciprocal effects were important for all measured
    traits under both environments indicating quality traits inheritance were controlled
    by both additive and non-additive gene action. Inbred lines TL156579, TL156583,
    and VL05128 had good potential for endosperm modification score and inbred lines
    TL147078 and VL05128 had good potential for tryptophan, protein and protein quality
    index under low N environment. Under optimum N environment, parental lines TL156579,
    TL156583 and VL05128 had good potential for endosperm modification whereas parental
    lines TL156591 had good potential for tryptophan and protein concentration in
    grain and quality index. Hybrids TL155932 x VL05128 TL148288 x TL147078, TL155932
    x TL156612, TL156612 x VL05128 and TL156579 x TL156591 had significant differences
    between F 1 hybrids and their F1 reciprocals for grain yield under low N environment.
    Under both low and optimum N environments, the importance of reciprocal effects
    was also identified for endosperm modification score, tryptophan, protein, and
    quality index.&lt;br&gt;
