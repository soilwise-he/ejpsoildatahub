  title: Analysis of Seepage Through The Dam Considering Various Soil Characteristics
    Using an Experimental and The Finite Element Modeling Technique
  abstract: In this study, the rate of seepage flow through the dam was investigated
    using both experimental and numerical modeling techniques. Two different types
    of soil samples were collected at a depth of 1m from the Auchi site in Edo State,
    Nigeria. The soil samples were subjected to preliminary tests such as the sieve
    analysis, the limit state (liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index),
    and the specific gravity test. Notable differences in the Geotechnical properties
    of two samples of soils were observed. The sieve analysis indicated that the particles
    passing through a 200-sieve number of size 0.075mm were 14.32% and 13.48% respectively.
    The liquid limit of sample 1 and sample 2 was determined to be 35% and 30%, the
    plastic limit 20.5% and 24.3%, the plasticity index 14.5% and 5.7% and the specific
    gravity of the two samples 2.63 and 2.65 respectively. Shear test was conducted
    to obtain the bearing capacity of soil using Terzaghi principle thereafter, the
    finite element analysis was used by applying SEEP/W of the Geo Studio program
    to determine the rate of flow of seepage through the dam. The result of the analysis
    showed that earthen dam without considering the core gave 12% difference in the
    seepage through the earthen material, the core of hydraulic conductivity 10 times
    less than that of the homogenous material gave 19.06% percentage difference seepage
    rate of flow with consideration of core with k 10 times less than homogenous material
    and the core of hydraulic conductivity 100 times less results gave 17.86% percentage
    difference for core of k 100 times less than homogenous material. Recommendations
    were made based on these results to reduce the rate of flow of seepage through
    the dam.
