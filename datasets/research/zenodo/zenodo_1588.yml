  title: 'In defence of soil biodiversity: Towards an inclusive protection in the
    European Union'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This review explored regulatory, incentive-based and knowledge-based
    instruments and strategic policy documents at the EU and national levels to determine
    whether they adequately protect soil biodiversity. The review of 507 literature
    references concluded that only eight EU member states explicitly address threats
    to soil biodiversity in 14 regulatory instruments while 13 countries mainly focus
    on implicit threats to soil biodiversity, whereas six countries do not consider
    soil biodiversity. At the EU level, current directives and regulations only tackle
    individual threats to soil biodiversity. An EU-wide, legally binding protection
    could ensure a standardised minimum level of soil biodiversity protection while
    preventing surging costs of not acting. The EU Soil Health Law foreseen for 2023
    could couple land management practices beneficial for soil biodiversity with incentive-based
    instruments. Simultaneously, models should be designed to predict soil biodiversity,
    considering soil biodiversity&rsquo;s spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This
    work was funded by the European Commission Horizon 2020 project SoildiverAgro
    [grant agreement 817819].&lt;/p&gt;'
