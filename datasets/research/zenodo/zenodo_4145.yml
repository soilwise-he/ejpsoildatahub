  title: Total And Leachable Concentration Of Trace Elements In Soil Towards Human
    Health Risk, Related With Coal Mine In Jorong, South Kalimantan, Indonesia
  abstract: "Coal mining is well known to cause considerable environmental impacts,\
    \ including trace element contamination of soil. This study aimed to assess the\
    \ trace element (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn) contamination of soil in\
    \ the vicinity of coal mining activities, using the case study of Asam-asam River\
    \ basin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia, and to assess the human health risk, incorporating\
    \ total and bioavailable (water-leachable and acid-leachable) concentrations.\
    \ The results show the enrichment of As and Co in soil, surpassing the background\
    \ soil value. Contamination was evaluated based on the index of geo-accumulation,\
    \ <em>I<sub>geo</sub></em> and the pollution index, <em>PI</em>. <em>I<sub>geo</sub></em>\
    \ values showed that the soil was generally uncontaminated (<em>I<sub>geo</sub></em>\
    \ \u2264 0), except for elevated As and Co. Mean <em>PI</em> for Ni and Cu indicated\
    \ slight contamination. Regarding the assessment of health risks, the Hazard Index,\
    \ <em>HI</em> showed adverse risks (<em>HI</em> &gt; 1) for Ni, Co, and As. Further,\
    \ Ni and As were found to pose unacceptable carcinogenic risk (<em>risk</em> &gt;\
    \ 1.10<sup>-5</sup>). Farming, settlement, and plantation were found to present\
    \ greater risk than coal mines. These results show that coal mining activity in\
    \ the study area contaminates the soils by particular elements and may pose potential\
    \ human health risk in its surrounding area. This study is important for setting\
    \ appropriate countermeasure actions and improving basic coal mining management\
    \ in Indonesia."
