  title: The Potential Effect Of Biochar Application On Microbial Activities And Availability
    Of Mineral Nitrogen In Arable Soil Stressed By Drought
  abstract: "Application of biochar to arable soils represents a new\napproach to\
    \ restore soil health and quality. Many studies reported the\npositive effect\
    \ of biochar application on soil fertility and\ndevelopment of soil microbial\
    \ community. Moreover biochar may\naffect the soil water retention, but this effect\
    \ has not been sufficiently\ndescribed yet. Therefore this study deals with the\
    \ influence of\nbiochar application on: microbial activities in soil, availability\
    \ of\nmineral nitrogen in soil for microorganisms, mineral nitrogen\nretention\
    \ and plant production. To demonstrate the effect of biochar\naddition on the\
    \ above parameters, the pot experiment was realized.\nAs a model crop, Lactuca\
    \ sativa L. was used and cultivated from\nDecember 10th 2014 till March 22th 2015\
    \ in climate chamber in\nthoroughly homogenized arable soil with and without addition\
    \ of\nbiochar. Five variants of experiment (V1 \u2013 V5) with different regime\n\
    of irrigation were prepared. Variants V1 \u2013 V2 were fertilized by\nmineral\
    \ nitrogen, V3 \u2013 V4 by biochar and V5 was a control. The\nsignificant differences\
    \ were found only in plant production and\nmineral nitrogen retention. The highest\
    \ content of mineral nitrogen\nin soil was detected in V1 and V2, about 250 %\
    \ in comparison with\nthe other variants. The positive effect of biochar application\
    \ on soil\nfertility, mineral nitrogen availability was not found. On the other\n\
    hand results of plant production indicate the possible positive effect\nof biochar\
    \ application on soil water retention."
