  title: Monitoring Leachate Migration in Compacted Soil Using Digital Image Technique
  abstract: "As leachate has been a source of groundwater contamination worldwide,\
    \ this paper examines the phenomenon of leachate migration on different gradations\
    \ of compacted laterite soil used as sanitary landfill liners. Three different\
    \ soil gradations (30%, 40% and 50% with respect to fines content) used in this\
    \ study were compacted in circular acrylic columns to provide a clear visualization\
    \ of leachate migration into the soils. Digital image technique was used in capturing\
    \ photos at successive time intervals to monitor the leachate migration. The captured\
    \ digital images were fed into Matlab and converted into hue-saturation-intensity\
    \ (HSI) format. Surfer software then read the HSI and generated 2D contour plots.\
    \ The results of the experiments showed that the leachate moves downward faster\
    \ in the soil gradation with the least fines content. Hydraulic conductivity values\
    \ decrease with increase in time duration and equally with increase in fines content.\
    \ The hydraulic conductivities of the leachate for 30%, 40% and 50% fines were\
    \ 3.64\xD710<sup>-9</sup>m/s, 2.40\xD710<sup>-9</sup>m/s, and 1.24\xD710<sup>-9</sup>m/s\
    \ respectively. This reveals that for tropical laterite soils, gradation containing\
    \ 50% fines content provides better hydraulic conductivity. The use of noninvasive\
    \ digital image technique can enable designers/engineers to monitor and visualize\
    \ the leachate migration in compacted soils in waste containment application systems."
