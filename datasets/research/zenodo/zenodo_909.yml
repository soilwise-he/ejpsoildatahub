  title: HEAVY METAL POLLUTION IN SOIL AND WATER AROUND LANDFILL DUMPSITE
  abstract: Anthropogenic activity enhances the heavy metal contamination in surrounding
    environment. This research was designed<br> to measure the metal pollution level
    from soil and ground water system around land fill dumpsite. The levels of pollution<br>
    measured from 0 distances to 1200m distance of landfill. The overall study indicated
    that concentration of heavy metals<br> Arsenic(As), Mercury(Hg), Lead(Pb), Cadmium(Cd),
    Chromium(Cr), Copper(Cu), Nickel(Ni) and Zinc(Zn) were<br> witnessed in very near
    to dumpsite also the concentration was decreased when distance increased. The
    levels of As, Hg,<br> Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn in soil were observed every 300m
    distance (90.75, 90, 77.3, 98.5, 92.3, 58, 95.9 and 94%)<br> respectively. The
    above level was compared to 1200m distance; the concentration was gradually reduced
    to (36.8, 0, 51.7,<br> 51.8, 50.4, 56, 51.3 and 46%) separately. Also the concentration
    of heavy metals in ground water samples at 300 m<br> distance were (100, 96, 90.2,
    93.91, 92, 95.5, 100, and 97.3%) the levels reduced to (24.2, 10.3, 30.7, 29.6,
    52.5, 49.6,<br> 21.1&amp;57.5%) at 1200m distance. This indicated that the nearest
    area soil and ground water were highly polluted; however<br> the heavy metals
    concentration was reduced gradually at far distance. To reduce th toxic compounds
    from the waste,<br> create awareness for the people to limit the waste from every
    house. Sanitary landfilling and composting is an excellent<br> and ecofriendly
    manner of waste mangement.
