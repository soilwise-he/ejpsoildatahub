  title: Using Waste and Polymer for Soil Stabilization
  abstract: Soil stabilization is a technique for improving and refining engineering
    qualities. Expansive clay soils are those whose volume fluctuates as the amount
    of water in the soil changes. In civil engineering, soil is one of the most regularly
    encountered materials. When constructions are discovered atop expanding soil,
    geotechnical engineers all over the world face major challenges. Stabilization
    of soil is the process of enhancing soil strength by artificial means. They have
    a tendency to inflate and shrink, posing a major threat to anything placed on
    top of them. The results of an attempt to fortify and stabilize clay soil with
    plastic strips are presented in this research. The plastic strips were produced
    and added in three different aspect ratios and three different mixing ratios (0.4%,0.8%,1.5%)
    by weight (4mm x 7mm, 8mm x 14mm,12mm x 18.5mm). The experimental findings revealed
    that shear strength parameters improved significantly. The soil's swelling and
    desiccation cracking tendencies were also significantly reduced. The optimum moisture
    content was reduced significantly, but the maximum dry density increased little.
    Based on the importance of the selection criterion for a specific engineering
    activity, the ideal plastic size (aspect ratio) and plastic content that produces
    the best outcomes can be chosen. The difficulties are solved concurrently by stabilizing
    vast soils using waste plastic bottles. The findings of this study point to the
    possibility of using this material in expanding soils to increase ground stability
    in geotechnical engineering.
