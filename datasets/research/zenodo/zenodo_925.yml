  title: EMMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES BY SOIL, ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
  abstract: Soils are a source and sink of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide
    (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Since the volumes of concentration
    and flux can be large, accurate quantitative estimates are need- ed to obtain
    the data on global GHG fluxes required for forecasting global changes and climate
    studies. This review shows the role of soils as one of the important sources and
    regulators of the content of CH4, CO2, N2O in the tropo- sphere, and also presents
    the main methods for monitoring greenhouse gases. The influence of natural and
    anthropogen- ic factors on the emission and absorption of CH4, CO2, N2O by the
    soil cover has been analyzed. Original diagrams are presented showing the global
    fluxes of CH4, CO2, N2O by various ecosystems, including the pedosphere. The estimation
    of methane emission and distribution of its content in the main types of soils
    of the Rostov region is carried out. The mechanisms of CH4, CO2, N2O generation
    in soils and their possible influence on the calcium-carbonate balance, which
    plays an important role in the regulation of biogeochemical processes in the pedosphere,
    are considered. The performed analysis and generalization of research data on
    various types of soils makes it possible to shed light not only on their contribution
    to the global methane emission, but also to approach the understanding of processes
    and parameters that are important from the point of view of agrochemistry, such
    as, in fact, carbonate-calcium equilibrium and redox poten- tial in modern soils.
    An inventory of sources and an assessment of the inter-reservoir gas mass transfer
    in the pe-dosphere- atmosphere system allows one to start developing a strategy
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will help curb the rate of global climate
    change.
