  title: 'The mechanization in production organicfertilizer and soil amendment in
    Indonesia: case of paddy field'
  abstract: <strong>ABSTRACT </strong> The dependency of the chemical fertilizer use
    in paddy field has degraded the soil quality and reduced the rice productivity
    in Indonesia. Since 2007, the government has introduced the importance of storing
    back the paddy straw into the field. The organic and semi-organic farming have
    also been grown lately. Small and big scales of production lines, producing the
    organic fertilizer and soil amendment, have been available. This paper aims to
    describe the role of mechanization in supporting the production of organic fertilizer
    and soil amendment in Indonesia. It was started by the introduction of compost
    processing units (Alatpengolahpupukorganik, APPO)in 2005-2010. The APPO ismainly
    a machine to cut up the rice straw and other biomass wastes for easier degradation
    in the process of composting. This paper analyzes the effect of applying the disseminated
    machinery in the production of composts or organic fertilizers and application
    in paddy field. Field surveys were conducted to find the sustainability application
    of the disseminated APPO analyzed from aspects of technical, economical and field
    management of using the machine, production the compost/organic fertilizer and
    application the compost in paddy production.The surveys resulted in that APPO
    machine has been widely used in the production of compost andorganic fertilizer.
    The applications of compost and organic fertilizer in paddy fieldwere still in
    complementary with chemical fertilizers. However, the use of compost could reduce
    50% of the usage of chemical N fertilizer. Further support in the small and medium
    production is still required to maintain the good quality of the compost product.
    Synergizing between the small/medium and the big industries may be needed to sustain
    the small/medium production lines.
