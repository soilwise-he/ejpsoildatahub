  title: Study on Physical and Mechanical Properties of Dispersive Soil
  abstract: 'This paper deals with determination of physical and mechanical properties
    of dispersive soil. Soil is the foundation material which supports loads from
    the overlaying structure. Soil dispersivity is mainly due to the presence of exchangeable
    sodium present in the structure. Dispersive soils are identified by an unstable
    structure, easily flocculated in water, and very erodible. Using dispersive clay
    soils in hydraulic structures, embankment dams, or other structures such as roadway
    embankments can cause serious engineering problems if these soils are not identified
    and used appropriately. Some important parameters of dispersive soil obtained
    from laboratory testing are investigated in this paper. Soil sample is taken from
    Mandalay at about 3ft depth. To determine physical properties of soil, water content
    determination, specific gravity test, grain size analysis, Atterberg limits test,
    crumb test. Standard Proctor compaction test, Unconfined Compression Strength
    UCS test are carried out to determine mechanical properties of soil. According
    to Unified Soil Classification System, the studied soil is in CH group and group
    name is lean clay with sand. From crumb test, sample has grade 4. Therefore, the
    studied soil is highly dispersive. Soe Soe War | Nyein Nyein Thant "Study on Physical
