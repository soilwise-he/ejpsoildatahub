  title: 'Subgrade soil stabilization using marine debris: A literature review'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The use of different marine residues found in the great biodiversity
    of the Peruvian coast, such as crushed mollusk shells or fan shells, can be used
    as mechanical stabilizers for clay soils due to a change in granulometry. In this
    article, we reviewed 70 research studies indexed in different databases such as
    Scopus, Scielo, Ebsco, Proquest, Springer Link, and ScienceDirect, whose publication
    has not exceeded seven years, with the objective of carrying out a systematic
    review of the use, effect and influence of marine debris as soil stabilizers.
    For this purpose, the analyses of the mechanical and also physical properties
    of such mixtures in different marine debris were reviewed compared to the various
    types of stabilizers currently used. These evaluated results indicate, that the
    Pacific razor clam shell offers a lower bearing capacity compared to the fan shell
    when stabilizing clayey soil. However, the shredded output of both types of marine
    debris can meet the need for clay subgrade stabilization. Based on the review,
    it was determined that the addition of different types of shredded marine debris
    reduces water absorption by capillarity, increasing the resistance and bearing
    capacity of the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
