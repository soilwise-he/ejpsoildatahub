  title: Identification And Mapping Of Hot Spot Areas Susceptible To Soil Erosion
    In Erak Al Karak Area Using Geoinformatics
  abstract: Jordan is a country dominated by arid climate and fragile ecological system,
    where 91% is classified as arid land with annual average rainfall rarely exceeds
    200 mm/y. Therefore, land degradation, soil erosion and desertification are important
    areas of interest, where soil erosion is considered one of the major causes for
    land degradation in Jordan. The main objective of this study is to create an erosion
    hazard map and identify the areas susceptible to soil erosion in Erak Al karak
    watershed in southern part of Jordan. Soil erosion model RUSLE with the integration
    of GIS tools has been developed to estimate the annual soil loss. The estimated
    mean annual soil loss is (38.7 ton/ ha/year). The erosion map produced highlighted
    the hot spot areas susceptible to soil erosion. A relationship was obvious between
    terraces land use and soil loss, where 22% of the soil loss was reduced by applying
    soil conservation technique (terraces). According to this model, most of the hot
    spot areas are located in the rangeland 63% while the agricultural areas are responsible
    for 14% of the hot spot areas. The results emphasis the importance of urgent land
    use planning and conservation practices to reduce the impact of soil erosion.
