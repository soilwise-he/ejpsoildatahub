  title: 'Effect of aridity on species assembly in gypsum drylands: a response mediated
    by the soil affinity of species'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Previous studies found that plant communities on infertile soils
    are relatively resistant to climatic variation due to stress tolerance adaptations.
    However, the species assemblies in gypsum soil habitats require further investigation.
    Thus, we considered the following questions. (1) Do harsher arid conditions determine
    the characteristics of the species that form plant assemblages? (2) Is the selection
    of the species that assemble in arid conditions mediated by their ability to grow
    on gypsum soils? (3) Is the selection of species that assemble in harsher conditions
    related to phylogenetically conserved functional traits? Perennial plant communities
    were analysed in 89 gypsum-soil sites along a 400 km climate gradient from the
    central to southeastern Iberian Peninsula. Each local assemblage was analysed
    in 30&nbsp;&times; 30 m plots and described based on taxonomic, functional (soil
    plant affinity) and phylogenetic parameters. The mean maximum temperatures in
    the hottest month, mean annual precipitation and their interaction terms were
    used as surrogates for the aridity conditions in generalized linear models. In
    the hottest locations, the gypsophily range narrowed and the mean gypsophily increased
    at the community level, thereby suggesting the filtering of species and the dominance
    of soil specialists in the actual plant assemblies. Drier sites had higher taxonomic
    diversity. The species that formed the perennial communities were close in evolutionary
    terms at the two ends of the aridity gradient. The mean maximum temperatures in
    the hottest month had the main abiotic filtering effect on perennial plant communities,
    which was mediated by the ability of species to grow on gypsum soils, and thus
    gypsum specialists dominated the species assemblies in the hottest locations.
    In contrast, the perennial communities on gypsum soils were relatively resistant
    to changes in precipitation. Our findings suggest that the warmer environmental
    conditions predicted by global change models will favour gypsum specialists over
    generalists.&lt;/p&gt;'
