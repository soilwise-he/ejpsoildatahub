  title: Seismic assessment and strengthening of a historical masonry bridge considering
    soil-structure interaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A holistic methodology for developing the digital twins and
    conducting seismic vulnerability assessments of masonry arch bridges is proposed
    and applied to a historical stone masonry bridge. In this light, digital cameras,
    drones, and 3D laser scanners were utilized for 3D geometric documentation of
    the bridge. 3D finite element (FE) models were constructed and calibrated based
    on the operational modal analysis results derived from the accelerometer sensors.
    The fragility curves for different limit states were derived by performing a multi-stripe
    analysis (MSA). The effect of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on the calibration
    results and seismic response of the bridge was evaluated. The results of the visual
    inspection, model calibration, and seismic analysis revealed that the central
    pier and the arches are the most susceptible parts of the bridge. Therefore, three
    strengthening techniques were proposed, and corresponding numerical models were
    developed. The first model was developed by enhancing the mechanical properties
    of the vulnerable parts of the bridge, and the two other models were built by
    covering the central pier&rsquo;s outer surface with polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole
    (PBO) and carbon fiber-reinforced concrete mortar (FRCM) layers. Results revealed
    that the strengthening techniques improved the seismic response of the bridge
    when subjected to transverse seismic excitations. Negligible differences in the
    displacement response and crack width of the strengthened models were observed
    from the nonlinear dynamic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;'
