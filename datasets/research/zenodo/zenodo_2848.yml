  title: Pile dynamic versus static load tests in fine-grained deposits of Southwest
    Iran with special attention on soil setup effects
  abstract: "Many precast driven piles have been constructed in soft soils of southwest\
    \ Iran in Khuzestan Province in oil, gas,<br> petrochemical and other industrial\
    \ projects within the past 20 years. Estimating the adequate pile bearing capacity\
    \ and<br> drivable embedment depth of piles are always a major challenging task\
    \ both during the design and construction phases.<br> Clients have been promoted\
    \ to carry out dynamic load test (DLT) and static load test (SLT) on both \u201C\
    test piles\u201D and<br> \u201Cconstruction piles\u201D to optimize the pile design\
    \ and improve the execution quality. Data sets of several projects with<br> number\
    \ of piles ranging from 5000 to 8000 in each project are compiled for comparison\
    \ purposes of the ultimate load<br> obtained from DLT with SLT tests. The study\
    \ area geological stratification is mostly comprised of soft cohesive layers<br>\
    \ on top underlain with medium stiff to stiff strata. Soil setup potential is\
    \ understood to be considerable in the region.<br> During the pile testing program,\
    \ it has been attempted to carry out DLT at the end of drive as well as restrike\
    \ at different<br> time intervals up until few weeks or months. Then correlations\
    \ for soil setup are used to determine the parameters of<br> the study site such\
    \ as \u201CA\u201D and t0 of Skov and Denvor relation. The results have shown\
    \ that the t0 is very variable in<br> the region ranging from 0.1 day in highly\
    \ permeable strata up to 1 day in pure cohesive strata with low permeability.<br>\
    \ The results also indicate that if the DLT tests are corrected for setup effects\
    \ equivalent to the SLT time past from the<br> initial drive, more accurate agreements\
    \ could reach. During piling operation, as it may not be feasible to wait for<br>\
    \ sufficiently long time for the setup to occur, and usually DLT tests are carried\
    \ out within few days from pile installation,<br> the extrapolated capacities\
    \ considering site specific setup effects are used in verifying the design capacities.<br>\
    \ Considerable savings are made through the explained procedure both in \u201C\
    construction cost\u201D and \u201Cconstruction time\u201D<br> of the projects."
