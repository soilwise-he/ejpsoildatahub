  title: Characterization of Keratinolytic Fungi and Bacteria Isolated From Soil-Rich
    Animal Wastes in Ijebu-Igbo Abattoir, South-West, Nigeria
  abstract: Massive production of keratinous wastes from agriculture and industries
    constitutes a major source of pollution globally. Hence, the objective of this
    study was to isolates microbial keratinase producers which can be used for bioconversion
    of animal-rich wastes in an eco-friendly manner. Soil rich horns, hooves and feathers
    were collected from abattoir and Moyo poultry farms in Ijebu-Igbo and transported
    to Microbiology laboratory, Babcock Univetrsity. Fungi and bacteria were isolated
    using compounded agar medium and nutrient agar respectively. Keratinase activity
    of the isolates was assessed using skim milk agar. The keratinase gene in bacteria
    was confirmed by PCR. Fungi and bacteria that produced better zone of inhibition
    on skim milk agar were sequenced using primers targeting 18S rDNA (fungi) and
    16S rRNA (bacteria) genes. Fungi (18) and bacteria (4) showed hydrolytic activities
    on skim milk agar. However, 6 fungi (<em>Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus pseudonomius,
    Aspergillus nomius, Aspergillus tamarii and Wickerhamomyces anomulus</em>) and
    4 bacteria (<em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, <em>Enterobacter hormaechei</em>, <em>Morganella
    morganii</em> and S<em>himwellia blattae</em>) were identified. The results revealed
    that different microbial genera capable of producing keratinases can be economically
    obtained and harnessed for industrial waste management. Hence, improvement of
    the keratinolytic organisms for industrial waste management is an asset especially
    in renewable energy and animal feeds.
