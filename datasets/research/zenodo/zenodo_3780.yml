  title: Effect of Plastic Fines on Liquefaction Resistance of Sandy Soil Using Resonant
    Column Test
  abstract: The aim of this study is to assess the influence of plastic fines content
    on sand-clay mixtures on maximum shear modulus and liquefaction resistance using
    a series of resonant column tests. A high plasticity clay called bentonite was
    added to 161 Firoozkooh sand at the percentages of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 by
    dry weight. The resonant column tests were performed on the remolded specimens
    at constant confining pressure of 100 KPa and then the values of G<sub>max</sub>
    and liquefaction resistance were investigated. The maximum shear modulus and cyclic
    resistance ratio (CRR) are examined in terms of fines content. Based on the results,
    the maximum shear modulus and liquefaction resistance tend to decrease within
    the increment of fine contents.
