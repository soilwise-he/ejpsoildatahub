  title: Screening Of Potential Antibiotic Producing Actinomycetes From The Soil Of
    Ganga River Bed Of Haridwar
  abstract: 'Actinomycetes are the mostly widely distributed group of microorganism
    in nature which is of high commercial value and thus are routinely screened for
    new antibiotics. We have undertaken this study to resolve the problem of antibiotic
    resistance. 6Actinomycetes were isolated from the soil by serial dilution method.
    Based on the biochemical characterization Nocardia sp. was chosen to check antibacterial
    potential. Optimization of growth was carried out at 290C for 5-7 days on Glycerol
    Yeast Extract Agar Medium. Antibacterial activity was studied against E.coli and
    Bacillus sp.. Antibacterial activity was determined using disc diffusion method.
    Antibacterial metabolite extracted using ethyl acetate was effective and gave
    zone of inhibition of 13mm and 20mm against the used pathogenic Bacillus and E.coli
    strains. As most microorganisms have developed resistance to existing antibiotics.
    So it has provoked the need of constant research like ours on the production of
    newer antibiotics. Keywords: Actinomycetes, antibiotics, Nocardia sp., E.coli,
    Bacillus, disc diffusion, GYEAM, Antibacterial potential.'
