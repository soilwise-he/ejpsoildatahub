  title: Flexible Laser-Induced Graphene for Nitrogen Sensing in Soil
  abstract: '&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Flexible graphene electronics are rapidly gaining interest, but their&nbsp;widespread
    implementation has been impeded by challenges with ink preparation, ink&nbsp;printing,
    and postprint annealing processes. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) promises a&nbsp;facile
    alternative by creating flexible graphene electronics on polyimide substrates
    through&nbsp;the one-step laser writing fabrication method. Herein, we demonstrate
    the use of LIG,&nbsp;created with a low-cost UV laser, for electrochemical ion-selective
    sensing of plant-available nitrogen (i.e., both ammonium and nitrate ions: NH
    + and NO &minus;) in soil samples. The laser used to create the LIG was operated
    at distinct pulse widths (10, 20,&nbsp;30, 40, and 50 ms) to maximize the LIG
    electrochemical reactivity. Results illustrated that&nbsp;a laser pulse width
    of 20 ms led to a high percentage of sp2 carbon (77%) and optimal&nbsp;peak oxidation
    current of 120 &mu;A during cyclic voltammetry of ferro/ferricyanide.&nbsp;Therefore,
    LIG electrodes created with a 20 ms pulse width were consequently&nbsp;functionalized
    with distinct ionophores specific to NH + (nonactin) or NO &minus;&nbsp;(tridodecylmethylammonium
    nitrate) within poly(vinyl chloride)-based membranes to&nbsp;create distinct solid
    contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) for NH + and NO &minus; ion sensing,
    respectively. The LIG SC-ISEs displayed near Nernstian sensitivities of 51.7 &plusmn;
    7.8 mV/dec (NH +) and &minus;54.8 &plusmn; 2.5 mV/dec (NO &minus;), detection
    limits of 28.2 &plusmn; 25.0 &mu;M (NH +) and 20.6 &plusmn; 14.8 &mu;M (NO &minus;),
    low long-term drift of 0.93 mV/h (NH + sensors) and &minus;5.3 &mu;V/h (NO &minus;
    sensors), and linear sensing ranges of 10&minus;5&minus;10&minus;1 M for both
    sensors. Moreover, soil slurry sensing was performed, and recovery percentages
    of 96% and 95% were obtained for added NH + and NO &minus;, respectively. These
    results, combined with a facile&nbsp;fabrication that does not require metallic
    nanoparticle decoration, make these LIG electrochemical sensors appealing for
    a wide&nbsp;range of in-field or point-of-service applications for soil health
    management.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
