  title: Potential of visible and near infrared spectroscopy coupled with machine
    learning for predicting soil metal concentrations at the regional scale
  abstract: Chemical analytical methods for metal analysis in soils are laborious,
    time-consuming and costly. This paper aims to evaluate the potential of short-range
    (SR) and full-range (FR) visible and infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIR) combined
    with linear and nonlinear calibration methods to estimate concentrations of nickel
    (Ni), cobalt (Co), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) in soils. A total of
    435 soil samples were collected over agricultural sites, forest (7 %), pasture
    (5 %) and fallow land across a region in the northern part of Belgium. Generally,
    better predictions were obtained when using partial least squares regression (PLSR)
    and nonlinear calibration method [i.e., random forest (RF)] for processing of
    the spectral data, than when using support vector machine (SVM). FR generally
    outperformed SR and provided the best prediction results for Ni (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>
    = 0.76), Co (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.77), Cd (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>
    = 0.64) and Pb (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.65), when using PLSR and RF. SVM
    produced the best prediction result only for Pb (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.57)
    using the SR spectra. The metals Ni, Co, Cd and Pb can be predicted successfully
    (good accuracy) from the FR vis-NIR spectra using PLSR for Co, and RF for Ni,
    Cd, Pb and Cu. Compared to the FR spectrophotometer, improvement in accuracy was
    obtained for Cd and Co, using the SR spectra when combined with PLSR and RF, respectively.
    It is concluded that the SR spectrometer can be used successfully for the prediction
    of Co with RF (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.70), while it best predicted Cd with
    PLSR with an R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> value of 0.67, which is of value for regional
    survey.
