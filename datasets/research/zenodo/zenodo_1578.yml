  title: Analysis of Soil Sample from Phar Ti Ma Chike Village Tract Loikaw Township
  abstract: 'In this research work, the soil samples were collected from Phar Ti Ma
    Chike Village Tract Loikaw Township. Soil samples were collected from the upper
    position near to the surface about 0 10 cm. Physicochemical properties of the
    soil samples were determined. In physical properties, the moisture and texture
    of the soil samples were measured by oven drying method and pipette method and
    then pH value was also measured by pH meter. Furthermore, the major components
    such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic matters of the soil samples
    were determined for chemical properties. The contents of exchangeable cations
    such as Ca2 and Mg2 were analysed. Khin Htay Win | Thidar Khaing | Yinn Kay Khaing
