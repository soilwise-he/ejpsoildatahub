  title: Fate of petroleum-based and plant-based teabags exposed to environmental
    soil conditions for one year
  abstract: 'Petroleum-based plastics are materials which have provided important
    industrial benefits. However, plastic pollution is pervasive and ubiquitous on
    all environments. This has led some industries to rapidly introduce the so called
    ''bioplastics'' into the market by switching the conventional ones for new plant-based
    alternatives with similar properties. However, little is known about the fate
    of such alternatives especially in the open environment. In this novel study,
    the degradation of teabags from eight different brands was investigated, five
    petroleum based (cellulose-PP blend) and three plant-based (cellulose, cellulose-PLA
    blend and PLA). The degradation was tested under real-environmental soil conditions
    over a 12-month period. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and
    Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques were used to examine the change
    in polymer makeup and surface degradation of teabags at 3 weeks, 3.5 months, 6
    months and 12 months. Teabag dry weight and any retrieved fragments were measured
    over time. Teabags that contained a plastic blended to cellulose were brittle
    or degraded into smaller fragments after 3 weeks in soil. Parallel to this, the
    cellulose layer also degraded in this short timeline. Petroleum-based teabags
    produced the highest numbers of PP fragments overtime and fragmented teabags were
    still found after 12 months. Plant-based teabags made of cellulose only or a blend
    of cellulose-PLA were absent from soil samples after 3.5 months, including no
    fragments. Contrary to this, teabags made of PLA which were marketed as completely
    biodegradable, persisted completely intact in soil throughout all time points.
    The novel results from this study provide a perspective on plastic degradation
    in terrestrial sources. Based on these findings, it can be recommended that teabags
    mostly made of cellulose or cellulose blended with a bioplastic present in a smaller
    ratio, are a better alternative to petroleum-based or pure PLA plastics, in terms
    of rapid environmental degradation. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/426297/document'
