  title: "The Impact of traditional cocoa-based agroforestry systems on chemical soil\
    \ fertility in southwest of C\xF4te d'Ivoire"
  abstract: "The sustainability of cocoa farming is a major concern for C\xF4te d'Ivoire.\
    \ Extensive and \"full sun\" cropping systems need to be reviewed. Against this\
    \ backdrop, a study was carried out in the south-west of the country (Soubr\xE9\
    \ and M\xE9agui), a major production zone, with the aim of assessing the impact\
    \ of traditional agroforestry systems on soil fertility.\nTwenty-seven cocoa farms\
    \ in the three sectors were visited. To assess the impact of cocoa-based agroforestry\
    \ systems on soil chemical parameters, four criteria guided the choice of plots.\
    \ These were mid-slope plots, 25 to 35 years old, unfertilized and denser in associated\
    \ trees. Soil samples were taken from the 0-20 cm horizon. Organic carbon, total\
    \ nitrogen, assimilable phosphorus, exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na), cation\
    \ exchange capacity and saturation rate were measured.\nThe results show that\
    \ traditional cocoa-based agroforestry systems have not impoverished the soil.\
    \ In fact, chemical fertility in these plots respects the needs of cocoa trees.\
    \ However, the study did not show an increase in soil organic matter due to the\
    \ fall of leaves from associated trees.\nThese results will enable the use of\
    \ traditional agroforestry systems without fear of soil impoverishment due to\
    \ any competition between cocoa trees and associated trees."
