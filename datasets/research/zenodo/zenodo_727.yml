  title: Targeting the soil quality and soil health concepts when aiming for the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the EU Green Deal
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The concepts of soil quality and soil health are widely used
    as soils receive more attention in the worldwide policy arena. So far, however,
    the distinction between the two concepts is unclear, and operational procedures
    for measurement are still being developed. A proposal is made to focus soil health
    on actual soil conditions, as determined by a limited set of indicators that reflect
    favourable rooting conditions. In addition, soil quality can express inherent
    soil conditions in a given soil type (genoform), reflecting the effects of past
    and present soil management (expressed by various phenoforms). Soils contribute
    to ecosystem services that, in turn, contribute to the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) and, more recently, to the EU Green Deal. Relevant soil ecosystem
    services are biomass production (SDG 2 &ndash; zero hunger), providing clean water
    (SDG 6), climate mitigation by carbon capture and reduction of greenhouse gas
    emissions (SDG 13 &ndash; climate action), and biodiversity preservation (SDG
    15 &ndash; life on land). The use of simulation models for the soil&ndash;water&ndash;atmosphere&ndash;
    plant system is proposed as a quantitative and reproducible procedure to derive
    single values for soil health and soil quality for current and future climate
    conditions. Crop production parameters from the international yield gap programme
    are used in combination with soil-specific parameters expressing the effects of
    phenoforms. These procedures focus on the ecosystem service, namely biomass production.
    Other ecosystem services are determined by soil-specific management and are to
    be based on experiences obtained in similar soils elsewhere or by new research.
    A case study, covering three Italian soil series, illustrates the application
    of the proposed concepts, showing that soil types (soil series) acted significantly
    differently to the effects of management and also in terms of their reaction to
    climate change.&lt;/p&gt;'
