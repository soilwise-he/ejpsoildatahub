  title: Investigation of Vibrations Influence on Clay Soil Parameters
  abstract: The behavior of clay under different frequencies encountered during a
    dynamic loading events like impact, wind, explosions, seismic, machine foundations
    is very difficult to analyse, so an attempt has been made to study the behaviour
    of clay subjected to different range of frequency applied in a laboratory setting
    on a representative clay sample obtained from a local source in Lithuania. A detailed
    characterisation of clay has been conducted to classify its index properties and
    engineering properties to study its behaviour under static loading and subjected
    to cycling loading using a vibrating table to test its mechanical properties such
    as compressibility, cohesion, friction angle, oedometric modulus of elasticity.
    In this paper the range of frequencies that are to be applied to the clay sample
    vary between 10 Hz and 50 Hz. Direct shear tests on clay samples are conducted
    under static and cyclic loading and investigated vibrations influence to strength
    parameters of soil. The effect of vibrations on clay oedometric modulus is determined
    by doing oedometer tests under the same conditions as shear tests. The testing
    showed that vibrations change mechanical properties of clay and it is important
    to evaluate this influence on strength parameters of soil. The investigation suggested
    that the behavior of clay subjected to vibrations becomes similar to undrained
    clay
