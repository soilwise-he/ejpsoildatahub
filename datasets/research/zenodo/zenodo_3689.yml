  title: Impregnation Of Cupper Into Kanuma Volcanic Ash Soil To Improve Mercury Sorption
    Capacity
  abstract: 'The present study attempted to improve the Mercury

    (Hg) sorption capacity of kanuma volcanic ash soil (KVAS) by

    impregnating the cupper (Cu). Impregnation was executed by 1 and

    5% Cu powder and sorption characterization of optimum Hg

    removing Cu impregnated KVAS was performed under different

    operational conditions, contact time, solution pH, sorbent dosage and

    Hg concentration using the batch operation studies. The 1% Cu

    impregnated KVAS pronounced optimum improvement (79%) in

    removing Hg from water compare to control. The present

    investigation determined the equilibrium state of maximum Hg

    adsorption at 6 h contact period. The adsorption revealed a pH

    dependent response and pH 3.5 showed maximum sorption capacity

    of Hg. Freundlich isotherm model is well fitted with the experimental

    data than that of Langmuir isotherm. It can be concluded that the Cu

    impregnation improves the Hg sorption capacity of KVAS and 1%

    Cu impregnated KVAS could be employed as cost-effective

    adsorbent media for treating Hg contaminated water.'
