  title: Methods For Preparation Of Soil Samples For Determination Of Trace Elements
  abstract: 'It is generally accepted that only about ten microelements are vitally
    important to all plants, and approximately ten more elements are proved to be
    significant for the development of some species. The main methods for their determination
    in soils are the atomic spectral techniques - AAS and ICP-OAS. Critical stage
    to obtain correct results for content of heavy metals and nutrients in the soil
    is the process of mineralization. A comparative study of the most widely spread
    methods for soil sample preparation for determination of some trace elements was
    carried out. Three most commonly used methods for sample preparation were used
    as follows: ISO11466, EPA Method 3051 and BDS ISO 14869-1. Their capabilities
    were assessed and their bounds of applicability in determining the levels of the
    most important microelements in agriculture were defined.'
