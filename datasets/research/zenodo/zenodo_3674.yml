  title: Analytical Slope Stability Analysis Based On The Statistical Characterization
    Of Soil Shear Strength
  abstract: Increasing our ability to solve complex engineering problems is directly
    related to the processing capacity of computers. By means of such equipments,
    one is able to fast and accurately run numerical algorithms. Besides the increasing
    interest in numerical simulations, probabilistic approaches are also of great
    importance. This way, statistical tools have shown their relevance to the modelling
    of practical engineering problems. In general, statistical approaches to such
    problems consider that the random variables involved follow a normal distribution.
    This assumption tends to provide incorrect results when skew data is present since
    normal distributions are symmetric about their means. Thus, in order to visualize
    and quantify this aspect, 9 statistical distributions (symmetric and skew) have
    been considered to model a hypothetical slope stability problem. The data modeled
    is the friction angle of a superficial soil in Brasilia, Brazil. Despite the apparent
    universality, the normal distribution did not qualify as the best fit. In the
    present effort, data obtained in consolidated-drained triaxial tests and saturated
    direct shear tests have been modeled and used to analytically derive the probability
    density function (PDF) of the safety factor of a hypothetical slope based on Mohr-Coulomb
    rupture criterion. Therefore, based on this analysis, it is possible to explicitly
    derive the failure probability considering the friction angle as a random variable.
    Furthermore, it is possible to compare the stability analysis when the friction
    angle is modelled as a Dagum distribution (distribution that presented the best
    fit to the histogram) and as a Normal distribution. This comparison leads to relevant
    differences when analyzed in light of the risk management.
