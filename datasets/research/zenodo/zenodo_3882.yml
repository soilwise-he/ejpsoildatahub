  title: Non-Linear Seismic Analysis Of Lattice- Monopole Type Wind Mill Tower On
    Different Soil Conditions
  abstract: The conventional wind mill towers are constructed using monopole or lattice
    type structure. we can get more power by increasing height of tower but by increasing
    height of tower the tower becomes uneconomical due to increased wall thickness.
    in the present research an innovative hybrid wind mill tower is proposed. the
    nonlinear time history analysis of proposed hybrid wind mill considering different
    soil is carried out and it is concluded that   hybrid wind mill tower is more
    effective compared to conventional monopole tower.
