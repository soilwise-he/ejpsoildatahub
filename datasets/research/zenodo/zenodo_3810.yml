  title: Developing A Town Based Soil Database To Assess The Sensitive Zones In Nutrient
    Management
  abstract: "For this study, a town based soil database created in\nG\xFCm\xFCs\xE7\
    ay District of Biga Town, \xC7anakkale, Turkey. Crop and\nlivestock production\
    \ are major activities in the district. Nutrient\nmanagement is mainly based on\
    \ commercial fertilizer application\nignoring the livestock manure. Within the\
    \ boundaries of district, 122\nsoil sampling points determined over the satellite\
    \ image. Soil samples\ncollected from the determined points with the help of handheld\n\
    Global Positioning System. Labeled samples were sent to a\ncommercial laboratory\
    \ to determine 11 soil parameters including\nsalinity, pH, lime, organic matter,\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,\niron, manganese, copper and zinc. Based on\
    \ the test results soil maps\nfor mentioned parameters were developed using remote\
    \ sensing, GIS,\nand geostatistical analysis. In this study we developed a GIS\
    \ database\nthat will be used for soil nutrient management. Methods were\nexplained\
    \ and soil maps and their interpretations were summarized in\nthe study."
