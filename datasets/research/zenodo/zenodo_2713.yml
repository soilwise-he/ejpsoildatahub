  title: Accumulation of Aluminium and Zinc in Chinese Convolvulus Planted in Sida
    Soil Enriched with Mixed Compost and Bottom Ash
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> This research aimed to study aluminium and
    zinc accumulation, percentage of germination, and growth of chinese convolvulus
    planted in Sida soil enriched with mixed compost and bottom ash. The ratios of
    Sida soil enriched with mixed compost and bottom ash were tested with chinese
    convolvulus. Data analysis was conducted using one way Analysis of Variance, Least
    Significant Difference tests, and Paired t-test. The result showed that chinese
    convolvulus planted in soil enriched with mixed compost and bottom ash at the
    ratio of 0.8:0.2 had the highest germination rate (82.78%). The highest aluminium
    accumulation was observed in chinese convolvulus root planted in Sida soil (905.09
    mg/kg dry weight), and the highest zinc accumulation was found in root that was
    planted in Sida soil enriched with mixed compost and bottom ash at the ratio of
    1:0 (169.40 mg/kg dry weight). In addition, accumulations of aluminium and zinc
    in plants tested in enriched Sida soil ratios were higher in roots than shoots.
    The accumulated amounts of zinc in chinese convolvulus shoots did not exceed the
    consumption criteria of the Food and Drug Administration of Thailand. The results
    suggest that compost mixed with bottom ash could be used for growing this vegetable.
