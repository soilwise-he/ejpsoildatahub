  title: The effect of soil pH on a carbohydrate level of tomato fruits (Lycopersicum
    esculentum Mill.) from bobo and Sidera villages
  abstract: Soil pH has an effect not only on the growth and production of tomatoes
    but also has an influence on sugar metabolism. How the pH influences a production
    and the change of the sugar is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to determine
    the effect of the soil pH on the carbohydrate content of tomatoes in Bobo and
    Sidera villages. The method used was quasi-experiment because the researchers
    did not randomly select tomatoes for the experimental group and the control group,
    but the researchers used tomato plants in the two villages that have the differences
    in the pH of the soil. The data obtained were analyzed using ANAVA assisted by
    XL STAT 2017 program. The results showed that the soil pH affected the carbohydrate
    content of tomato fruit found in Bobo and Sidera Villages. The pH of the soil
    in Sidera Village was lower than the pH found in the village of Bobo.
