  title: Digital soil mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery supported by ASTER thermal
    infrared bands
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The importance of monitoring soil properties is constantly increasing
    among researchers and policy-makers. In this context,&nbsp;it is imperative to
    identify cost-effective and reliable strategies for soil mapping compared to the
    costlier traditional&nbsp;solutions. A wide range of tools are becoming available
    that enable better utilization of Earth Observation capabilities to monitor the
    soil ecosystem. This work is an effort of assessing the potential of Sentinel-2
    imagery data for mapping Soil&nbsp;Organic Matter (SOM) contents and investigating
    the possibilities of its enhancement through ASTER derived information.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The rural area around the lake Zazari, located in the Western Macedonia
    district of Greece, was chosen as study area.&nbsp;Initially, pixel-wise vegetation
    indices (NDVI and NBR2) were calculated, utilizing a local version of the CEOS
    Open&nbsp;Data Cube for masking Sentinel-2 bare soil pixels extending a three-year
    period (2017&ndash;2019). The generated mask was&nbsp;used to extract soil spectral
    signatures at the image level over selected 100 field samples. The resulting time
    series was expanded through the conjunction of ASTER Thermal InfraRed bands by
    matching the exact data acquisition dates of two&nbsp;platforms.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The conclusive part of the work contains the application of regression
    modelling to effectively assess soil variables. The local Partial Least Square
    regression algorithm was chosen, due to its characteristics of performing inherently
    local predictions. Five-fold cross-validation technique was used for reporting
    the models&rsquo; accuracy, which was assessed through R2 coefficient, RPIQ ratio
    and RMSE. The model estimated SOM values among a synthetic bare soil composite
    image that was acquired over study area&rsquo;s agricultural fields. Two models
    were trained and compared; one over Sentinel-2 imagery bands that were used as
    the predictor variables&rsquo; set and a second over an expanded predictor variables&rsquo;
    set, including ASTER thermal bands. The results signified evidence of accuracy
    increase of SOM content assessment, through spaceborne imagery analysis.&lt;/p&gt;'
