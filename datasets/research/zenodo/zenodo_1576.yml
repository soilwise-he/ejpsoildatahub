  title: Studying the Efficiency of Suaeda Maritima (L.) Dumort in Phytoremediation
    of Saline Soil
  abstract: "Based on the study of Suaeda maritima, here are some key points: 1. Suaeda\
    \ maritima is a true halophyte that grows naturally along the Mediterranean coast.<br>\
    \ 2. The soil near the S. maritima rhizosphere was highly saline and had lower\
    \ concentrations of most metals during the summer months.<br> 3. Heavy metals\
    \ were taken up by the roots and more heavily concentrated in the shoots and roots\
    \ during the summer.<br> 4. Water content and ash content were higher during the\
    \ winter season, while the phenols content and Na levels were higher in both the\
    \ shoots and roots during the summer.<br> 5. The Ca content accumulated the most\
    \ at site 2 during the summer for shoots, and those growing at site 1 for roots,\
    \ either in winter or summer.<br> 6. The maximum Mg value was recorded in plants\
    \ at site 1 during the summer in both the shoots and roots.<br> 7. Cl content\
    \ was the highest accumulation in S. maritima at site 1 during the summer for\
    \ shoots and those at site 2 during the winter for roots.<br> 8. The researchers\
    \ also assessed the translocation factor and bioconcentration factor for heavy\
    \ metals. Enable Ginger<em>Cannot connect to Ginger</em> Check your internet connection<br>\
