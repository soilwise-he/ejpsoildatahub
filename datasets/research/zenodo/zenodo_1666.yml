  title: 'Coping with living in the soil: the genome of the parthenogenetic springtail
    Folsomia candida'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Folsomia
    candida&lt;/i&gt; is a model in soil biology, belonging to the family of Isotomidae,
    subclass Collembola. It reproduces parthenogenetically in the presence of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;,
    and exhibits remarkable physiological adaptations to stress. To better understand
    these features and adaptations to life in the soil, we studied its genome in the
    context of its parthenogenetic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:
    &lt;/strong&gt;We applied Pacific Bioscience sequencing and assembly to generate
    a reference genome for &lt;i&gt;F. candida&lt;/i&gt; of 221.7 Mbp, comprising
    only 162 scaffolds. The complete genome of its endosymbiont &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;,
    was also assembled and turned out to be the largest strain identified so far.
    Substantial gene family expansions and lineage-specific gene clusters were linked
    to stress response. A large number of genes (809) were acquired by horizontal
    gene transfer. A substantial fraction of these genes are involved in lignocellulose
    degradation. Also, the presence of genes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis was
    confirmed. Intra-genomic rearrangements of collinear gene clusters were observed,
    of which 11 were organized as palindromes. The &lt;i&gt;Hox&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster
    of &lt;i&gt;F. candida&lt;/i&gt; showed major rearrangements compared to arthropod
    consensus cluster, resulting in a disorganized cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:
    &lt;/strong&gt;The expansion of stress response gene families suggests that stress
    defense was important to facilitate colonization of soils. The large number of
    HGT genes related to lignocellulose degradation could be beneficial to unlock
    carbohydrate sources in soil, especially those contained in decaying plant and
    fungal organic matter. Intra- as well as inter-scaffold duplications of gene clusters
    may be a consequence of its parthenogenetic lifestyle. This high quality genome
    will be instrumental for evolutionary biologists investigating deep phylogenetic
    lineages among arthropods and will provide the basis for a more mechanistic understanding
    in soil ecology and ecotoxicology.&lt;/p&gt;'
