  title: Effects of land use on greenhouse gas fluxes and soil properties of wetland
    catchments in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America
  abstract: Wetland restoration has been suggested as policy goal with multiple environmental
    benefits including enhancement of atmospheric carbon sequestration. However, there
    are concerns that increased methane (CH4) emissions associated with restoration
    may outweigh potential benefits. A comprehensive, 4-year study of 119 wetland
    catchments was conducted in the Prairie Pothole Region of the north-central U.S.
    to assess the effects of land use on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and soil properties.Results
    showed that the effects of land use on GHG fluxes and abiotic soil properties
    differed with respect to catchment zone (upland, wetland), wetland classification,
    geographic location, and year. Mean CH4 fluxes from the uplands were predictably
    low (&lt;0.02gCH4m-2day-1), while wetland zone CH4 fluxes were much greater (&lt;0.001-3.9gCH4m-2day-1).
    Mean cumulative seasonal CH4 fluxes ranged from roughly 0-650gCH4m-2, with an
    overall mean of approximately 160g CH4 m-2. These maximum cumulative CH4 fluxes
    were nearly 3 times as high as previously reported in North America. The overall
    magnitude and variability of N2O fluxes from this study (&lt;0.0001-0.0023gN2Om-2day-1)
    were comparable to previously reported values.Results suggest that soil organic
    carbon is lost when relatively undisturbed catchments are converted for agriculture,
    and that when non-drained cropland catchments are restored, CH4 fluxes generally
    are not different than the pre-restoration baseline. Conversely, when drained
    cropland catchments are restored, CH4 fluxes are noticeably higher. Consequently,
    it is important to consider the type of wetland restoration (drained, non-drained)
    when assessing restoration benefits. Results also suggest that elevated N2O fluxes
    from cropland catchments likely would be reduced through restoration. The overall
    variability demonstrated by this study was consistent with findings of other wetland
    investigations and underscores the difficulty in quantifying the GHG balance of
    wetland systems.
