  title: The Response of Mulching to Soil Moisture Content and the Yield of Lettuce
  abstract: Mulch materials, whether organic or inorganic, prevent soil moisture loss,
    suppress weeds, improve and maintain healthy soil structure for plant development
    and yield. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of mulch materials
    (Straw Mulch, Plastic Mulch and Neem Mulch) on soil moisture content, growth,
    and yield of lettuce as well as effective weed count with Zero Mulch as control.
    The result showed a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05) of the mulch materials on
    soil moisture content, leaf area, leaf and weed count as well as yield in the
    form of fresh biomass of lettuce. The results suggest that the organic mulch (straw
    and neem) materials enhance the growth and yield of the lettuce plant better with
    an appreciable soil moisture conservation.
