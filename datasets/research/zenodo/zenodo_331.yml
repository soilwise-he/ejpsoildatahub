  title: Studies of Biosurfactant Producing Oil Contaminated Soil
  abstract: Bioremedial use of microbes is becoming significant in combating pollution
    problems. These studies were initiated with the same approach to find microbial
    species capable to produce biosurfactant and make the oil-contaminated soil suitable
    for plant growth. Initially seven bacterial strains and two yeasts were screened
    with the outcome of most impressive potential in only one of them and it was identified
    as Pseudomonas aeruginosa JCM5962 (T) by 16S rDNA technique. The organism shows
    production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant, as per FTIR report analysis, in the exponential
    growth phase but more in stationary phase. It can use sesame oil meals as cheap
    carbon source and beef extract as a nitrogen source. For production of biosurfactant
    C/N ratio is 60, i.e., stress on nitrogen contents is giving good results. It
    can grow in presence of 5% of oil contents which is significant as a bioremedial
    property. Critical mycelial concentration of rhamnolipid produced is 29mg/100ml
    and reducing surface tension to 27 Dynes/cm when production conditions provided
    are optimal.
