  title: A global estimate of monthly vegetation and soil fractions from spatio-temporally
    adaptive spectral mixture analysis during 2001-2022
  abstract: "This dataset is an example of global estimates of monthly vegetation\
    \ and soil fractions using spatio-temporally adaptive spectral mixture analysis.\
    \ Due to the database capacity limitation, we uploaded a part of the dataset (2001,\
    \ 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020), which is a month-by-month export of the data, according\
    \ to the grid of longitude 60\xB0 and Latitude 50\xB0. Since the dataset for each\
    \ year includes 216 files, named as 'SMA_year_(month-1)_gridid.tif', like 'SMA_2001_0_0.tif'\
    \ These datasets of other years can be exported from GEE by our code or achieved\
    \ by request from authors. Here is a schematic of global girds 65N 2 5 8 11 14\
