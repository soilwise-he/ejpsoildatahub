  title: The QuantiSlakeTest, measuring soil  structural stability by dynamic weighing
    of  undisturbed samples immersed in water
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We evaluated
    the performance of a new, simple test to evaluate soil structural stability. The
    QuantiS-&lt;br&gt;lakeTest (QST) consists in a quantitative approach of the slake
    test, a dynamic weighing of a dried structured&lt;br&gt;soil sample once immersed
    in water. The objective of this work was threefold: we aimed to (i) derive indicators&lt;br&gt;from
    QST curves to evaluate soil structural stability, (ii) establish the relationship
    between soil properties and&lt;br&gt;QST indicators, and (iii) assess how QST
    indicators respond to contrasting soil management practices. To reach&lt;br&gt;these
    goals, we sampled the soil of 35 plots from three long-term field trials in the
    silt loam region of Belgium&lt;br&gt;dealing respectively with contrasting organic
    matter inputs, tillage and P&ndash;K fertilisation. For each plot, indica-&lt;br&gt;tors
    calculated from QST curves (e.g. total relative mass loss, disaggregation speed
    and time to meet a threshold&lt;br&gt;values of mass loss) were compared to the
    results of the three tests of Le Bissonnais (1996), used as a reference&lt;br&gt;method
    for the measurement of soil aggregate stability.&lt;br&gt;Shortly after immersion
    in water, soil mass increases due to the rapid replacement of air by water in
    soil&lt;br&gt;porosity. Then soil mass reaches a maximum before decreasing, once
    mass loss by disaggregation exceeds mass&lt;br&gt;gain by air loss. Our results
    confirmed that the early mass loss under water is mainly related to slaking, whereas&lt;br&gt;after
    a longer time period, clay dispersion and differential swelling become the dominant
    processes of soil disag-&lt;br&gt;gregation. The overall soil structural stability
    was positively correlated to the soil organic carbon (SOC) content&lt;br&gt;and
    negatively correlated to the clay content of soil. Consequently, the SOC : clay
    ratio was closely related to&lt;br&gt;QST indicators. Nevertheless, for a similar
    mean annual carbon (C) input, green manure and crop residues were&lt;br&gt;more
    efficient in decreasing clay dispersivity and differential swelling, whereas farmyard
    manure promoted SOC&lt;br&gt;storage and was more efficient against slaking. QST
    curves had a strong discriminating power between reduced&lt;br&gt;tillage and
    ploughing regardless of the indicator, as reduced tillage increases both total
    SOC content and root&lt;br&gt;biomass in the topsoil.&lt;br&gt;The QST has several
    advantages. It (i) is rapid to run, (ii) does not require expensive equipment
    or consum-&lt;br&gt;ables, and (iii) provides a high density of information on
    both specific mechanisms of soil disaggregation and&lt;br&gt;the overall soil
    structural stability. As an open-access programme for QST data management is currently
    under&lt;br&gt;development, the test has a strong potential for adoption by a
    widespread community of end users.&lt;/p&gt;'
