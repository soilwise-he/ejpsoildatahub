  title: Evaluation Of Soil Stiffness And Strength For Quality Control Of Compacted
    Earthwork
  abstract: "Microstructure and fabric of soils play an important<br>\nrole on structural\
    \ properties e.g. stiffness and strength of compacted<br>\nearthwork. Traditional\
    \ quality control monitoring based on moisturedensity<br>\ntests neither reflects\
    \ the variability of soil microstructure nor<br>\nprovides a direct assessment\
    \ of structural property, which is the<br>\nultimate objective of the earthwork\
    \ quality control. Since stiffness<br>\nand strength are sensitive to soil microstructure\
    \ and fabric, any<br>\nindependent test methods that provide simple, rapid, and\
    \ direct<br>\nmeasurement of stiffness and strength are anticipated to provide\
    \ an<br>\neffective assessment of compacted earthen materials\u2019 uniformity.\
    \ In<br>\nthis study, the soil stiffness gauge (SSG) and the dynamic cone<br>\n\
    penetrometer (DCP) were respectively utilized to measure and<br>\nmonitor the\
    \ stiffness and strength in companion with traditional<br>\nmoisture-density measurements\
    \ of various earthen materials used in<br>\nThailand road construction projects.\
    \ The practical earthwork quality<br>\ncontrol criteria are presented herein in\
    \ order to assure proper<br>\nearthwork quality control and uniform structural\
    \ property of<br>\ncompacted earthworks."
