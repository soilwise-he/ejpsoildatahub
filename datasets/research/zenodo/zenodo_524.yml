  title: Experimental Investigation Of Different Shaped Isolated Footings Under Static
    Load And Impact Loading On Sandy Soil And Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: "Any Civil Engineering Structure must rest on a strong foundation or as\
    \ per the strength criteria. Bearing capacity and settlement are the two major\
    \ criteria for designing of foundation. Also it is not always subjected to monotonic\
    \ loading but it may be subjected to impact loading. The examples are lifts, bridges\
    \ foundation, machine foundation, offshore structure, wind waves etc. In this\
    \ dissertation work, with the experimental investigations work an attempt has\
    \ been made to study the behavior and suitability of various shaped footing specimens\
    \ which may be a choice for laying of foundation. For this purpose the area of\
    \ footing specimens has been kept same as 400 cm2 for all shapes of footings and\
    \ thereafter the dimension are fixed accordingly. As a consideration for knowing\
    \ of effect of settlement the dissertation work is studied under black cotton\
    \ soil and sandy soil as two different strata.\n\n \n\nAlso, in this dissertation\
    \ work, the loading on the footing has been differentiated as static and Impact\
    \ loading so that settlement tests were conducted on all specimens and load intensity\u2013\
    settlement curves are to be plotted. It is also required to verify the suitability\
    \ of the shape as per loading on different types of soil.\n\n \n\nIt is concluded\
    \ after studying the load intensity settlement behavior that hexagonal footing\
    \ shows least settlement while square and rectangular footing shows maximum settlement\
    \ at same loading intensity. Experimentally it is found that hexagonal footing\
    \ shows better performance while other footing shows considerable behavior.The\
    \ study is carried out using two types of soil namely, sandy soil and black cotton\
    \ soil as strata which suggest that penetration is more for black cotton soil.\
    \ In this test study the density and moisture content of the soil were kept same\
    \ as existing in the field. Load intensity \u2013settlement curves are compared\
    \ with standard behaviour and studied for further conclusions and scope."
