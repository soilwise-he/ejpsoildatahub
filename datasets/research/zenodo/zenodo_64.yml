  title: Soil Organic Carbon (OC)
  abstract: Soil organic carbon improve soil structure, water retention, soil biodiversity,
    buffering capacity and the cycling and storage of plant nutrients. In addition,
    the mineralization of soil organic carbon provides plant nutrients, especially
    nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur (S), as well as with micronutrients. Therefore,
    the measure of soil organic carbon levels is necessary to determine the soil fertility.
    The Walkley-Black method was chosen as it is a simplified method, which provides
    accurate measurements on soils with high organic carbon content. <strong>Application
    and Principle</strong> The Walkley-Black (WB) method (Walkley and Black, 1934)
    determines soil organic carbon (OC) by oxidising carbon with acidic dichromate
    (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). The oxidation step is followed by
    titration of excess dichromate with ferrous sulfate. The OC is calculated from
    the the difference between the total dichromate added and the amount of dichromate
    left unreacted after the OC oxidation. The method provides an estimate of soil
    Organic Matter from OC determination assuming that the fraction of soil OC reacted
    and the amount of OC in soil OM. This method was widely considered a standard
    method for OM after its development, but the advance of thermal decomposition
    instruments has resulted in its limited use. Instead loss on ignition and thermal
    decomposition methods are more widely used due to their ability to analyse samples
    in a more time efficient manner.
