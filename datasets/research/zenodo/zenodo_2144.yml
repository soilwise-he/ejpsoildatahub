  title: Soil enzymatic activity in artificially and naturally regenerated forests
    after wind damage in north-eastern Poland
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to describe biochemical reactions in
    the soil based on the activity of urease and dehydrogenases in Scots pine stands
    damaged during and differentially managed after hurricanes. Soil enzymatic activity
    was investigated in 2005 and again in 2013 for selected stands in the Pisz Forest
    District where wind damage occurred in 2002. Most of the damaged stands were cut
    down and replanted, but 445 ha were left untouched for study purposes. The investigated
    areas differed with respect to stand damage and management. The enzymatic activity
    correlated well with the content of organic matter which was higher in organic
    than in mineral soils. In the area left to regenerate naturally, dehydrogenase
    and urease activity was higher in 2013 compared to 2005, which suggests the improvement
    of site conditions. The values of the examined biochemical parameters were correlated
    with the type of forest regeneration, with the forest soil regeneration being
    higher in artificially than in naturally regenerated stands. Changes of soil enzymatic
    activity were correlated with the level of stand damage and the type of management
    after wind damage.&lt;/p&gt;'
