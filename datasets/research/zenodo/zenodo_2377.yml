  title: Landscape typing based on hillslope and floodplain soil water models to functionally
    target sixteen riparian management options
  abstract: The report describes how the principals of a soil hydrological classification
    system describing the dominant water flowpaths through soil and substrate can
    be translated to consider typical sequences of flow from hillslope to watercourse
    (with and without a floodplain) to describe main water pathways across riparian
    zone soil sequences for Scotland. It also identifies how such soil-based landscape
    models can guide the selection between riparian management measures spanning conventional
    buffer strips, surface runoff, subsurface pathway and in-channel management options
    and uses exemplar Scottish catchments to show the diversity of the occurrence
    of the differing landscape models at a small catchment scale and show examples
    of how they may be used at the farm to field scale to short-list measure options
    and the recommended next steps for field survey.
