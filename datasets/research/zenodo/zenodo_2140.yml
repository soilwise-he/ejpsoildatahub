  title: Evaluation of Liquefaction Hazards in Soil Layers along Tabriz Metro Line
    1 based on Practical Methods
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Settlements in the ground and deep soil layers can occur after
    the liquefaction phenomenon&mdash;these deformations damage structures, buildings,
    and lifelines. Several practical methods have recently been proposed based on
    fields and laboratory data for evaluating volumetric strain (settlement) and maximum
    shear strain due to liquefaction. The present study mainly aimed to compare liquefaction
    potential assessment findings in terms of risk intensity and settlement values
    of soil layers after liquefaction using Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Energy
    Methods along Tabriz Metro Line 1. Thus, 31 boreholes along the path were selected
    in this regard. Then, the liquefaction potential of soil layers was assessed based
    on the above-mentioned methods, and the liquefaction potential risk index was
    determined as well. Finally, the settlement value of soil layers was evaluated
    according to the two proposed methods&#39; findings. The findings showed that
    both processes were relatively correlated, and the energy method proposed higher
    liquefaction potential risk compared to the SPT procedure.&lt;/p&gt;'
