  title: The Study of Stresses on Soil From Roadways Using Plaxis To Generate Potential
    Energy With Piezoelectric
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Environmental resources exploitation is one of the critical
    problems in environmental engineering. The overuse of environmental resources
    can lead to a huge impact for the environment and human itself. The problems of
    extracting and processing of raw materials from earth such as mining, steam power
    and machinery has increased year by year and this is the main reason that the
    resources has become very limited for the future generations to use them. This
    study is focused in designing a roadway through software analysis which will use
    the concept of piezoelectricity that will convert the stress energy from the roadways
    into electrical energy. A software which is called PLAXIS 2D will be used to simulate
    the stresses from the roadway which are caused by moving vehicle loading. The
    parameters of laterite and clay soil such as Specific Gravity, Liquid Limit, Friction
    Angle and Cohesion are obtained from the past research is needed for the input
    of the software. The loading application in the PLAXIS 2D uses the Mohr-Coulomb
    failure criterion in which fully drained and axisymmetric conditions were assumed.
    A non-uniform grid with 1726 elements was performed for the calculations on a
    2-dimensional cross-sections of 11m x 3m roadway. The stresses resulted from the
    software are used to determine the value of stresses required for the piezoelectric
    to convert the stress energy into electrical energy.&lt;/p&gt;'
