  title: A Review on Sustainable Method for Vegetables Cultivation without Soil -
    Hydroponics
  abstract: Open field/soil-based agriculture has faced significant difficulties since
    the dawn of civilization, chief among which is the decline in the amount of land
    available per person, per capita land was 0.5 ha in 1960 when there were 3 billion
    people on the planet. Today, there are 6 billion people, but that number will
    drop to 0.25 ha by 2050. Arable area under cultivation will continue to shrink
    as a result of increased urbanisation, industrialization, and iceberg melting.
    Once more, soil fertility has reached a saturation point, and more fertiliser
    application does not result in an improvement in productivity. The production
    of food using traditional soil-based agriculture is also threatened by factors
    such as low soil fertility in some cultivable areas, reduced chances of natural
    soil fertility build-up by microbes due to continuous cultivation, frequent drought
    conditions, unpredictable climate and weather patterns, rise in temperature, river
    pollution, poor water management and waste of enormous amounts of water, decline
    in ground water level, etc. Different hydroponic structures, including wick, ebb
    and flow, drip and nutrient film technique (NFT) systems, have also been covered.
    This method has several advantages over conventional farming, including shorter
    crop growth cycles, yearround output, low disease and pest incidence, and the
    elimination of tasks like weeding, spraying, and watering. Commercial hydroponic
    technology must be successfully implemented, thus it's critical to develop low-cost
    methods that are simple to use and maintain, need less labour overall, and have
    lower setup and maintenance costs. The global hydroponics market is expected to
    increase from US $ 226.45 million in 2016 to US $ 724.87 million by 2025 as a
    result of technological developments within the sector and a number of economic
    variables.
