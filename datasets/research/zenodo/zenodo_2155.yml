  title: Studies on Soil Humic Substances. Part I. Fractionation of Fulvic acid and
    Characterization of Sugar Components
  abstract: Department of Macromolecules, Indian Association for the Cultivation of
    Science, Calcutta-700032 <em>Manuscript received 11 February 1974 ; accepted 23
    May 1974</em> Fulvic acid was isolated from soil humic substance and the barium
    salt of it was precipitated at different pH values (4.8, 8.0 and unprecipitated
    one) to give three fractions which were collected and purified by reprecipitation.
    Two fractions were shown to be homogeneous by electrophoresis and paper chromatography.
    Potentiometrie titrations were carried out on these three fractions to characterise
    them. The sugars and amino acids present in them were identified. One of the fractions
    was enzymati ally degraded to give galaetose, arabinose and a pentasaccharide.
    The structure of this oligosaccharide was elucidated.
