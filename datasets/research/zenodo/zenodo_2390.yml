  title: Improving the system of technical diagnostics and environmentally safe operation
    of soil hydraulic structures on small rivers
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper reports the results of studying soil hydraulic structures
    (SHS) of the CC1 class of consequences on small rivers. The representativeness
    of the results for the domestic and world practice of further operation of such
    structures is ensured by the typical technical and technological approaches to
    the construction, materials, and conditions of their work. Dams are built of soil
    materials and operated over significant time periods while their standard service
    life has been exhausted, which increases the environmental and technical danger
    of their further operation. Visual surveys were conducted and the technical condition
    was instrumentally diagnosed by the geophysical method of the earth&#39;s natural
    pulsed electromagnetic field (ENPEMF); observational data were mathematically
    treated. The possibility of arranging areas of increased water filtration through
    the SHS body was substantiated, as well as watering, loosening, and suffusion;
    potentially dangerous zones prone to landslides, cracks, and collapse were determined.
    The probability of risk of an accident on dams was estimated at their cascading
    arrangement as a result of filtration deformations of the body and the base of
    the structure. Under current operating conditions, the possibility of letting
    the normative and excess (forced) water volumes through water discharge facilities
    due to precipitation or a breakthrough of the structure located upstream was estimated.
    The proposed approach makes it possible to manage the cascade of hydraulic structures
    at different stages of operation: planned, operational decision-making, forecasting.
    This allows diagnostic examinations to be performed in order to identify structures
    that require priority in raising funds for repair and restoration work or demolition
    (dismantling)&lt;/p&gt;'
