  title: Field-Scale Characterization of Spatio-Temporal Variability of Soil Salinity
    in Three Dimensions
  abstract: "Information on spatial, temporal, and depth variability of soil salinity\
    \ at field and landscape scales is important for a variety of agronomic and environment\
    \ concerns including irrigation in arid and semi-arid areas. However, challenges\
    \ remain in characterizing and monitoring soil secondary salinity as it can largely\
    \ be impacted by managements including irrigation and mulching in addition to\
    \ natural factors. The objective of this study is to evaluate apparent electrical\
    \ conductivity (EC<sub>a</sub>)-directed soil sampling as a basis for monitoring\
    \ management-induced spatio-temporal change in soil salinity in three dimensions.\
    \ A field experiment was conducted on an 18-ha saline-sodic field from Alar\u2019\
    s Agricultural Science and Technology Park, China between March, and November\
    \ 2018. Soil EC<sub>a</sub> was measured using an electromagnetic induction (EMI)\
    \ sensor for four times over the growing season and soil core samples were collected\
    \ from 18 locations (each time) selected using EMI survey data as a-priori information.\
    \ A multi-variate regression-based predictive relationship between EC<sub>a</sub>\
    \ and laboratory-measured electrical conductivity (EC<sub>e</sub>) was used to\
    \ predict EC with confidence (R<sup>2</sup> between 0.82 and 0.99). A three-dimensional\
    \ inverse distance weighing (3D-IDW) interpolation clearly showed a strong variability\
    \ in space and time and with depths within the study field which were mainly attributed\
    \ to the human management factors including irrigation, mulching, and uncovering\
    \ of soils and natural factors including air temperature, evaporation, and groundwater\
    \ level. This study lays a foundation of characterizing secondary salinity at\
    \ a field scale for precision and sustainable management of agricultural lands\
    \ in arid and semi-arid areas."
