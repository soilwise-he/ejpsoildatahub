  title: 'Phytoremediation of Soil Contaminated with Petroleum Hydrocarbons: A Review
    of Recent Literature'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Booming anthropogenic activities is the main reason of widespread
    contamination of soil by petroleum hydrocarbons, resulting in environmental, health
    and socio-economic concerns. Remediation of contaminated soil has received much
    attention including phytoremediation which has the advantages of being low cost
    and technologically uncomplicated. Numerous papers on phytoremediation have been
    published and this review aims to examine selected studies on phytoremediation
    in the past five years to deduce the study trend and make recommendations for
    the way forward. The review shows an increasing number of studies combining phytoremediation
    with other methods particularly the physical methods such as soil amendment, electrokinetic
    remediation and surfactant application, as well as bioremediation using fungi
    and bacteria. There is increasing interest to investigate the synergy of these
    methods which leads to co-applications of one or more remediation methods with
    phytoremediation. Such co-applications often yield higher petroleum hydrocarbons
    removal rates in shorter time. Future studies can also include chemical remediation
    in the synergistic studies of phytoremediation and other remediation methods.&lt;/p&gt;
