  title: Relationships between flora biodiversity, soil physiochemical properties,
    and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity in a semi-arid forest
  abstract: "&lt;b&gt;Background and aim&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi\
    \ (AMF) communities are a main component of soil. They could be an indicator of\
    \ fertility of semi-arid ecosystems. We aimed to analyse the biodiversity of AMF\
    \ and understorey plants in Zagros forest (Iran), and to find their relationships\
    \ with environmental conditions (physiography and soil).&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 Seventy-five plots (20 m \xD7 20 m) were randomly divided from 1 700\
    \ to 1 900 m a.s.l. In each plot, four 1.5 m \xD7 1.5 m microplots were established\
    \ and all trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species coverage were recorded. Furthermore,\
    \ four soil samples were taken from a depth of 0\u201320 cm in each microplot\
    \ (one pooled sample for each main plot) by auger in spring. These soil samples\
    \ were used for AMF assessment and soil physiochemical properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 Seventeen AMF species (in Glomeraceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae,\
    \ Gigasporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae) and 47 plant taxa (in Poaceae, Asteraceae,\
    \ Fabaceae and fourteen other families) were identified. Tests determined that\
    \ the factors soil P, slope, tree coverage, litter thickness, and soil texture\
    \ affect AMF and plant communities. Soil physiochemical properties have an effect\
    \ on AMF, plant diversity, and evenness diversity indices. Furthermore, there\
    \ is a high correlation between plants and AMF diversity indices and any change\
    \ in the plant diversity will result in AMF changes. The results also showed positive\
    \ correlations between plant diversity and AMF diversity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 AMF and plant diversity indices are highly correlated, but this correlation\
    \ could be affected by soil physiochemical properties and environmental factors.\
    \ Moreover, canopy coverage and litter thickness are considered as strongly influencing\
    \ both plants and AMF."
