  title: Bacteriological and heavy metal assessment of a tropical crude oil- polluted
    soil, water and sediment
  abstract: "Crude oil-polluted environment serves as a reservoir of microbial species,\
    \ especially bacteria. Determining these bacterial genera is of great benefit\
    \ to environmental assessment and recovery. This study evaluated the bacteria\
    \ and selected heavy metals present in crude oil-polluted sites in K-dere community,\
    \ Ogoniland. The study was carried out at the Department of Microbiology, University\
    \ of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Crude oil-polluted soil, water, and\
    \ sediment samples were collected from K-dere community, Ogoniland. The pH and\
    \ heavy metals composition of each sample was determined using pH meter and spectrophotometer,\
    \ respectively, while isolation and biochemical characterization were done to\
    \ evaluate the heterotrophic and hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria present in each\
    \ sample. Results revealed that iron (Fe) had the highest concentration in the\
    \ soil (898.77\xB10.022 mg/kg) and sediment (1556.7\xB10.163 mg/kg) samples, while\
    \ lead (Pb) had the lowest overall concentration. The concentration of total petroleum\
    \ hydrocarbon (TPH) (10410.5 mg/kg) in soil sample exceeded the DPR standard limit\
    \ of 5000 mg/kg for soil. The results of total culturable heterotrophic bacterial\
    \ counts (TCHBC) and total culturable hydrocarbon utilizing bacterial counts (TCHUBC)\
    \ showed that soil and sediment samples had the highest TCHBC and TCHUBC values\
    \ of 2.66 \xB1 0.03 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL and 4.7 \xB1 0.14 x 10<sup>7</sup>\
    \ CFU/mL respectively. Morphological and biochemical characterization of the isolates\
    \ revealed the presence of <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, <em>Bacillus </em>spp, <em>Acidiphilium</em>\
    \ spp, <em>Mycobacterium</em> spp and <em>Leptospirillum</em> spp in the samples\
    \ with <em>Pseudomonas </em>spp having the highest percentage occurrence. This\
    \ study has revealed the presence of useful bacterial species in the sampled sites\
    \ which can be harnessed for an <em>in situ</em> cleaning of crude oil- contaminated\
    \ site, especially in the tropical region."
