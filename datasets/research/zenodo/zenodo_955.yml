  title: Chelation in Relation to Iron Mobilization and Phosphate Availability in
    Soil
  abstract: Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture,
    University of Kalyani, West Bengal<br> <em>Manuscript received 5 May 1973; accepted
    26 June 1973</em> A comparative study of iron mobilization and consequent release
    of phosphate by three pure chelating agents from two major types of West Bengal
    soils at different pH, has been carried out. Irrespective of the soils the order
    of chelating ability of pure compounds has been found to be succinic acid &gt;
    phloroglucinol &gt; glutamic acid in the major part of pH-range.
