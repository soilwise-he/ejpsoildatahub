  title: Evaluation of the Development of Roselle (Hibiscus Sabdariffa L.) in Two
    Soil Types with Interaction of Bacterial Cells and Vermicompost
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract\u2014 </strong>In this study, we tested the growth of\
    \ two varieties of Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) cultivated in two types of soils\
    \ and the effects of the inoculation of seeds with cells of bacterial strains\
    \ and vermicompost. (H. sabdariffa) are a member of the Malvaceae family and an\
    \ important plant because its calyxes are used to produce beverages, prepare food,\
    \ in the textile industry, cosmetology, perfumery, medicine, etc. This research\
    \ was carried out at the Postgraduate College, Montecillo Campus, Mexico. The\
    \ experimental design was completely randomized blocks with a factorial arrangement\
    \ (4x3x2): four levels of organic matter factor, three levels of bacterial strains\
    \ factor, and two levels of soil factor with three repetitions. The variables\
    \ tested were: germination percentage (GP), plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD),\
    \ the number of leaves (NL), foliar area (FA cm<sup>2</sup>), radical volume (RV\
    \ cm<sup>3</sup>), dry aerial part biomass weight (DAPBW), dry root biomass weight\
    \ (DRBW), dry calyx biomass weight (DCBW) and chlorophyll content (CC). The effects\
    \ of soil and bacterial strains showed significant differences (p \u2264 0.05)\
    \ on the agronomic characteristics of (H. sabdariffa) plants. The organic matter\
    \ factor only presented significant differences (p \u2264 0.05) in the germination\
    \ percentage and growth variables of the vegetative phase. To increase crop production,\
    \ the use of wastewater and microorganisms is proposed. Vermicompost exploded\
    \ the percentage of germination, height, the number of leaves and stem diameter\
    \ during the first weeks of growth, presenting important results in Creole variety\
    \ (farmers\u2019 local variety). By inoculating seeds with cells of bacterial\
    \ strains, A9m and A7 helped significantly to stimulate plant growth, finding\
    \ a better response in A9m strain. The effects of soil factor showed significant\
    \ differences (p \u2264 0.05) in soil irrigated with residual water over agronomic\
    \ characteristics satisfying the nutritional requirements of the crop."
