  title: "\uFEFFInvasive terrestrial invertebrate detection in water and soil using\
    \ a targeted eDNA approach"
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Terrestrial invasive invertebrates can rapidly colonise new\
    \ areas, causing detrimental effects on biodiversity, economy and lifestyle. Targeted\
    \ environmental DNA (eDNA) methods could constitute an early detection tool given\
    \ their sensitivity to small numbers of individuals. We hypothesised that terrestrial\
    \ runoff would transport eDNA from the land into adjacent waterbodies and used\
    \ the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) as a model species to\
    \ test this hypothesis. We collected water samples from four waterbodies adjacent\
    \ (&lt; 10 m from the creek edge) to infestations following rainfall events for\
    \ eDNA analysis. We also collected soil samples from areas of known infestations\
    \ and tested five eDNA extraction methods to determine their efficiency to extract\
    \ eDNA from soil. Water samples resulted in positive yellow crazy ant eDNA amplification\
    \ (20\u2013100% field replicates across all sites), even at one site located 300\
    \ m away from where ants had been detected visually. Soil samples resulted in\
    \ a higher percentage of false negatives when sampled from ant transit areas than\
    \ from nest entrances. Unpurified DNA extracts from soil also resulted in false\
    \ negative detections and only after applying a purification step of DNA extracts,\
    \ did we detect yellow crazy ant eDNA in 40\u2013100% of field replicates across\
    \ all methods and sites. This is the first study to empirically show that eDNA\
    \ from a terrestrial invertebrate can be successfully isolated and amplified from\
    \ adjacent or downstream waterbodies. Our results indicate that eDNA has the potential\
    \ to be a useful method for detecting terrestrial invertebrates from soil and\
    \ water.&lt;/p&gt;"
