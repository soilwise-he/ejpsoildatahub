  title: Effect of Protein on Soil Erosion by Water
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-2, (U.P.)
    <em>Manuscript received 14 February, 1975; accepted 29 May, 1975</em> The effect
    of protein (gelatine) on eroded and uneroded soils (0-20 ems. depth) collected
    from semidesert (Agra); Arid (Allahabad), semi-arid (Saharanpur), sub-humid (Gorakhpnr).
    Vindhyan(Mtrzapur) and uundelkhand (Jhansi) regions of the State of Uttar Pradesh
    (India) was observed. These soils were treated with 1% and 2% gelatine and kept
    for 15 days and 30 days for reaction in aqueous media. Generally, the eroded soils
    have lower erosion coefficients with 1% gelatine than those of uneroded soils.
    Greater period of contact between the gelatine and soils (here 30 days) with both
    the concentration recorded lower erosion coefficients (better check of soil erosion)
    except those of Vindhayao and sub-humid regions.
