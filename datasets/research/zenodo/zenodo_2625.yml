    \ the effects of soil amendments by organic and inorganic fertilizers for the\
    \ growth and yield performance of Abelmoschus esculentus L. (Moench). Field trials\
    \ were carried out at the field section of Bioresources Development Centre, Odi,\
    \ in 2017 cropping season. The treatment consisted of sugarcane-bagasse+poultry-waste\
    \ (SBPW) at 3:2, compost tea, NPK (15:15:15) and control without fertilizer arranged\
    \ in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times. The NPK fertilizer\
    \ and SBPW were applied 2 table spoonful per plant and compost tea was applied\
    \ 100 mL per plant during vegetative growth of plant. Data were obtained for plant\
    \ height, number of leaf, stem girth, leaf width, leaf length and fresh weight\
    \ of fruit on ten (10) plants that were randomly sampled. SBPW, compost tea and\
    \ NPK influenced the growth and yield performance of okra. NPK and SBPW at week\
    \ 3 after 3WAP produced the highest plant height of 37.60 and 37.19 cm, respectively.\
    \ Also, highest number of leaves and leaf width per plant was obtained in the\
    \ application of SBPW having 14.00 and 30.76 respectively. The highest leaf length\
    \ was evidenced in NPK application (31.06) and stem girth had the highest in compost\
    \ tea application (6.18). The control, without fertilizer, was significantly the\
    \ lowest in the growth parameters compared with other treatments but had the highest\
    \ number of fruit set (p&lt;0.05). The highest average fruit fresh weight was\
    \ obtained in SBPW application. Hence, the organic fertilizers, especially SBPW\
    \ as amendment is therefore recommended on both enriched and malnourished soil.\n\
