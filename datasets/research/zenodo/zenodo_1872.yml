  title: Agroecological Screening of Copper Alternatives for the Conservation of Soil
    Health in Organic Olive Production
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of soil conditioner (vermicompost tea), fertiliser
    (potassium silicate), and biological control agents (BCAs) as practical agroecological
    copper alternatives against olive leaf spot (Spilocaea oleaginea (Cast.) Hughe.)
    disease was investigated between 2018 and 2021 under organic management in a Mediterranean
    climate. In total, 9 agroecological alternatives to copper oxychloride (vermicompost
    tea, potassium silicate,&nbsp;Bacillus subtilis&nbsp;EU 007 WP,&nbsp;Platanus
    orientalis&nbsp;leaf extract,&nbsp;Mycorrhiza&nbsp;mix, seaweed commercial product,&nbsp;Trichoderma
    citrinoviride&nbsp;TR1, vermicompost tea+Platanus orientalis&nbsp;mix,&nbsp;Penicillium&nbsp;(Mouldy
    bread pieces)) were applied to olive trees in a randomised block design with 4
    replicationsTotal water soluble phenol compounds (TWSP) were found to be the main
    bioindicator to assess the alternatives and their potential to phase-out copper
    application. Results related to TWSP indicated that copper oxychloride (control),
    potassium silicate and vermicompost tea showed significantly higher content of
    TWSP as we compared zero application of copper and other treatments. These stimulate
    the antioxidant capacity in olive fruits and reduce the olive leaf spot disease
    incidence. The pollution effect of copper was monitored during the trial to identify
    soil pollution in the organic in-conversion experimental land. The total annual
    &lsquo;active copper&rsquo; application was 4.7 kg.ha&minus;1.year&minus;1&nbsp;and
    this is in accordance with the legal organic legislation of Turkey. During the
    conversion period from conventional to organic management, we determined approximately
    50% reduced copper content in the soil 0&ndash;30 cm depth samples in 2020 (3.70
    mg.kg&minus;1) as it is compared to those initial samples (6.43 mg.kg&minus;1)
    in 2018. We conclude that alternatives to copper that are easily accessible, e.g.,
    vermicompost tea, have a potential for use in organic olive production to replace
    copper in mitigating olive leaf spots. Furthermore, we find that reduced copper
    application in organic management with the aim to decrease copper accumulation
    in soil, fruits and leaves was not yet enough to reduce copper to satisfactory
    levels. We conclude that further research with the aim of a total replacement
    of copper fungicide treatments in organic and non-organic systems is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
