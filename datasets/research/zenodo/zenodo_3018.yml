  title: Antibiotic Resistance in Agricultural Soil and Crops Associated to the Application
    of Cow Manure-Derived Amendments From Conventional and Organic Livestock Farms
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The application of organic amendments to agricultural soil can enhance
    crop yield, while improving the physicochemical and biological properties of the
    recipient soils. However, the use of manure-derived amendments as fertilizers
    entails environmental risks, such as the contamination of soil and crops with
    antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements
    (MGEs). In order to delve into these risks, we applied dairy cow manure-derived
    amendments (slurry, fresh manure, aged manure), obtained from a conventional and
    an organic farm, to soil. Subsequently, lettuce and wheat plants were grown in
    the amended soils. After harvest, the abundance of 95 ARGs and MGE-genes from
    the amended soils and plants were determined by high-throughput qPCR. The structure
    of soil prokaryotic communities was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing
    and qPCR. The absolute abundance of ARGs and MGE-genes differed between treatments
    (amended vs. unamended), origins of amendment (conventional vs. organic), and
    types of amendment (slurry vs. fresh manure vs. aged manure). Regarding ARG-absolute
    abundances in the amendments themselves, higher values were usually found in slurry
    vs. fresh or aged manure. These abundances were generally higher in soil than
    in plant samples, and higher in wheat grain than in lettuce plants. Lettuce plants
    fertilized with conventional amendments showed higher absolute abundances of tetracycline
    resistance genes, compared to those amended with organic amendments. No single
    treatment could be identified as the best or worst treatment regarding the risk
    of antibiotic resistance in soil and plant samples. Within the same treatment,
    the resistome risk differed between the amendment, the amended soil and, finally,
    the crop. In other words, according to our data, the resistome risk in manure-amended
    crops cannot be directly inferred from the analysis of the amendments themselves.
    We concluded that, depending on the specific question under study, the analysis
    of the resistome risk should specifically focus on the amendment, the amended
    soil or the crop. &copy; Copyright &copy; 2021 Jauregi, Epelde, Alkorta and Garbisu.&lt;/p&gt;'
