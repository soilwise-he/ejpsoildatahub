  title: Design of a Low-cost and Compact Radiometer for Spectral Acquisition of Vegetation
    and Bare Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;We describe, in this article, the design of a low-cost and compact
    radiometer with five analog channels for spectral acquisition: four in the visible
    (blue, green, red and panchromatic) and one channel in the near-infrared. This
    small embedded system is based on an 8-bit microcontroller for automatic data
    acquisition, calibrating, storing and serial link processing with a compatible
    PC, through a C++ application software provided to handle and deal with the mass
    of data collected and stored in an EEPROM. The acquisition of spectral reflectance
    measurements of an object for different wavelengths allows the construction of
    a characteristic curve, named spectral signature of the object. The study of the
    spectral signatures of different types of surfaces such as water, bare ground
    or vegetation allows their identification in remote sensing image processing,
    and consequently, facilitates the interpretation of this kind of data, as, for
    instance, the AVHRR data of the HRPT images acquired and freely distributed by
    the satellite NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;'
