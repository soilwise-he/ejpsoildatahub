  title: Electrometric Titrations of Fulvic Acids from Soil Humus
  abstract: Fulvic acids isolated from four different soils were subjected to electrometric
    titrations, both conductometric and potentiometric, with caustic soda in presence
    and absence of sodium chloride. Baryta alone was also used for titration. On the
    basis of the breaks and inflexions in the titration curves the functional groups
    of the fulvic acids could be estimated. The fulvic acids from Palampur, Dehra
    Dun, and Jodhpur differed from that from Chinsura in having two breaks in the
    conductometric titration curves instead of three in the latter. The potentiometric
    titrations did not show significant variations. The titration curves of fulvic
    acids were compared with those of succinic, phthalic and salicylic acids as model
    substances. The base exchange capacities calculated from titrations with caustic
    soda, as also baryta varied from 690 to 1300 m.e./100 g for the different fulvic
    acids.
