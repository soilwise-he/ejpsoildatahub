  title: The Air, Water, and Soil Quality in the Surrounding of Zaatari Refugee Camp
  abstract: This study was conducted to assess the water, air, and soil quality in
    the surrounding of the Zaatari refugee camp. Analysis of physical and chemical
    parameters of the surface runoff water, groundwater, wastewater, soil, and air
    quality were conducted. The electrical conductivity, pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>,
    HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,
    SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and trace of the heavy metals include Zn, Mn, Cd,
    Cr, Cu and Pb were analyzed. The sodium adsorption ratio and water salinity were
    used to assess the feasibility of wastewater effluent for irrigation. The dust
    settlement system was used to track the air quality within the Zaatari camp for
    ten months. To better recognize and identify the possible source of pollution,
    the camp area was divided into three areas (A, B, and C). Location was chosen
    to represent the major activities and population density inside the camp. The
    result showed the water quality parameters for the groundwater from the three
    wells inside the camp were found to be within Jordanian drinking water standards'
    acceptable limits. The soil profile showed high levels of heavy metals, the upper
    soil had a much higher concentration than the lower soil, suggesting that heavy
    metals are accumulated on the top of the soil as a result of camp activities,
    as well as low mobility of these metals in a slightly alkaline soil climate. The
    results also showed that there was no significant heavy metal contamination in
    the sewage system. The inlet of the WWTP, on the other hand, had a higher concentration
    of heavy metals than the other sites, which can be due to wastewater deposition
    from the three sites examined. There was also no major pollution in the air quality
    within the camp, indicating that there is no source of heavy metal contamination
    in the area. Based on sodium adsorption ratio and water salinity analysis, the
    feasibility of wastewater treatment plant effluent for irrigation purposes indicates
    that wastewater is unsuitable for sensitive plants but acceptable for certain
    salt-tolerant plants under certain conditions.
