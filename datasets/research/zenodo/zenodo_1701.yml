  title: Soil binding properties of mucilage produced by a basidiomycete fungus in
    a model system
  abstract: A saprophytic, lignin-decomposing basidiomycete fungal isolate (BB1),
    identified as a member of the russuloid lineage closest to the genus Peniophora,
    plays a role in soil aggregation and stabilization. In liquid media this fungus
    secretes large amounts of extracellular materials or mucilage that act as soil
    binding agents. We investigated the nature of these materials using periodate
    treatment and lectin cytochemistry, and studied whether or not these materials
    are involved in soil aggregation. Water stability of artificial fungal amended
    soil aggregates was destroyed by periodate treatment suggesting that polysaccharides
    produced by the basidiomycete were involved in soil aggregation. Binding patterns
    of fluorescently labeled lectins were also investigated to determine specific
    carbohydrate moieties present in the fungal mucilage. Fluorescently conjugated
    lectins (Ulex europaeus Agglutinin I and Lotus tetragonolobus lectin) bound to
    extracellular mucilage indicating that this basidiomycete mucilage contains fucosyl
    sugar residues. We also demonstrated that water stability of artificial soil aggregates
    prepared with fungal mycelia pretreated with L(-)fucose lectins were significantly
    reduced. This study indicates that fungal-derived material containing fucosyl
    residues plays a role in soil adhesion.
