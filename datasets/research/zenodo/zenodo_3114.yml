  title: 'Distribution of soil microbes in urban parks: an effect of under-tree crown
    and hillside position on testate amoeba assemblages in subtropics (Shenzhen, China)'
  abstract: Testate amoebae (TA) are important components of soil ecosystems, where
    they play an essential role in belowground food webs. In this study, we examined
    species composition, diversity, and structure of TA assemblages in soils beneath
    tree crowns (microscale) at three slope positions (mesoscale) in subtropical urban
    parks in Shenzhen, China. 42 species of TA belonging to 18 genera were identified
    in 81 samples. TA assemblages were the most diverse and abundant in the center
    of the tree crown comparing with other under-tree habitats. Foot of the hills
    harbors higher TA abundance and diversity comparing with upper locations along
    the hillslopes. The distribution of TA was mostly driven by under-crown and hillside
    positions but not by elementary environmental conditions such as pH, moisture
    content and thickness of leaf litter layer. None of later factors were sufficient
    in shaping TA assemblage composition. The findings of our study suggest that in
    regional studies of soil microbial eukaryotes both micro- (i.e. under-crown) and
    mesoscale (i.e. the slope position) heterogeneity should be considered.
