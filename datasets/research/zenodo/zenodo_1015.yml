  title: 'Not only priming: Soil microbiota may protect tomato from root pathogens'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies have investigated soil microbial
    biodiversity. However, the mechanisms regulating plant responses to soil microbiota
    are largely unknown. A previous work tested the hypothesis that tomato plants
    grown on native soils with their complex microbiotas respond differently from
    tomato growing in a sterile substrate. Two soils, suppressive or conducive to
    &lt;em&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/em&gt; f. sp. &lt;em&gt;lycopersici&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(FOL),
    and two genotypes susceptible and resistant to the same pathogen were considered.
    The work highlighted that the two tested soil microbiotas, irrespectively of their
    taxonomic composition, elicit the PAMP-triggered Immunity Pathway, the first level
    of plant defence, as well as an increased lignin synthesis, leading to an active
    protection when FOL is present in the soil. Here, we tested the expression of
    a panel of genes involved in Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI), demonstrating
    that soil microbiota, beside genotype, affects plant resistance to FOL also modulating
    this pathway.&lt;/p&gt;'
