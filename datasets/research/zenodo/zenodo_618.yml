  title: Production of Extracellular Pectinase from Cultivable Soil Bacteria Strains
  abstract: Among the abundant and highly interactive microbial groups present in
    soil, actinobacteria stand out. An extracellular enzyme type produced by this
    phylum of bacteria is pectinases, which are enzymes capable of degrading pectin
    complex biomolecules. The present study aimed to evaluate the pectinolytic activity
    of actinobacteria. Forty-five strains of actinobacteria were selected according
    to their morphological characteristics, area where they were isolated and diversity
    of genera. The pectinolytic enzymatic index (EI) for each strain was determined
    by the ratio between the hydrolysis halo diameter (Dh) and the colony diameter
    (Dc). Of the 45 actinobacteria strains evaluated in this study, 35 (77.8%) showed
    pectinase production, the five most productive having enzymatic indices greater
    than 6. One thing to be noticed in our study is that more than 30% of or strains
    can be classified as strong producers of pectinase, which show the ecological
    and biotechnological potential of strains analyzed.
