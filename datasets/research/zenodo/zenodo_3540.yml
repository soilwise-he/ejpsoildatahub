  title: Biosorption Of Heavy Metals Using Aspergillus Species Isolated From Contaminated
    Soil.
  abstract: With the rapid development of industries heavy metal pollution has become
    one of the major global concerns due to their toxicity and threat to human life
    and environment. This work evaluated the heavy metal biosorption potential of
    Aspergillus sp. (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus) isolated from contaminated
    soil of Bhagwanpur industrial area, Haridwar. The heavy metal concentrations were
    determined after digestion of soil samples. The results indicate the heavy metal
    resistant fungi that were isolated and screened for the biosorption potential.
    The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pb, Cr, Ni and Zn was determined
    by agar diffusion method in 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 ppm concentrations. In this
    study, adsorption of Zn, Ni, Cr and Pb were investigated and two sp. of Aspergillus
    were identified viz. Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The results
    showed that Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus could biosorb all the
    metals in the order Zn&gt;Ni&gt;Cr&gt;Pb and Pb&gt;Cr&gt;Zn&gt;Ni respectively.
