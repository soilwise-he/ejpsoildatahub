  title: CHANGES OF SOIL FAUNA DIVERSITY IN SEVERAL TYPES OF SUPER WET TROPICAL RAIN
    FOREST AREA
  abstract: Land type changes in the super wet tropical rain forest area caused fluctuations
    in the diversity of soil fauna which caused disruption of ecosystem balance. This
    research was conducted for four months, in November 2017-February 2018. Data on
    soil fauna was taken using pitfall traps and hand sorting. Furthermore, the soil
    fauna data obtained were identified and calculated the value of the diversity
    index, evenness and dominance on each type of land for four months. The results
    showed that forests had a high diversity index of soil fauna, which were 3,134,
    3,313 and 3,314 in the first to the third month. While in the 4th month the forest
    diversity index decreased to 2,981. In open land, the soil fauna diversity index
    value is moderate, which is 2.631, 2.998, 2.782 and the diversity index increases
    in the fourth month, is 3.084. Mixed gardens have a value of the fauna diversity
    index of 2,728, 3,113, 2,870 and increased in the fourth month of 3,084. Whereas
    monoculture gardens have diversity index values of 2,527, 3,214, 2,935 and 2,927.
    Changes in land types of super wet tropical rainforests have an effect on changes
    in the level of diversity of soil fauna and not always these changes reduce the
    level of diversity of soil fauna.
