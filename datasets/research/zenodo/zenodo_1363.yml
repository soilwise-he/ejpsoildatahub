  title: The Impact of Soil Desalination on Reduction of Iron Concentration in Groundwater
  abstract: Brackish water is one source of clean water and drinking water in coastal
    areas, river estuaries, and small islands. Various studies have carried out that
    the use of clay can reduce minerals in the water. This research aims to find out
    and analyze the Cascade Aerator System and Rapid Sand Filter based on Clay in
    Reducing Iron Concentration in Well Water. The type of research used is experimental
    with a quantitative approach. In this study, the researchers used the Pretest-Posttest
    Control Group Design. The study's location was conducted on Sapuli Island in Pangkep
    Regency, South Sulawesi Province, and Sindulang Satu Village in Manado City, Central
    Sulawesi Province. The study's design used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD)
    with a combination of treatments that obtained 6 x 3 = 18 treatment combinations.
    This study's population is all well water that is in two research areas, and then
    the sample collection technique is used simple random sampling with 15 samples
    of well water. The research obtained a decrease in the maximum average iron (Fe)
    level obtained reached 57.27% by adding a 20-gram of clay as desalination in 10
    liters of well water. The decline that occurred in the two study sites did not
    differ significantly. Reduction of Iron (Fe) levels through Cascade aerators and
    Rapid Sand Filters by adding clay as a binder due to the material of kaolin in
    clay.
