  title: Phytotechnological foundations of fighting with allelopathic soil sickness
    in Syringa vulgaris L. monocultural plantings
  abstract: "<strong>Objective</strong> \u2013 to analyze the effect of brown mustard\
    \ (<em>Brassica juncea</em> (L.) Czern.) and tyfon (<em>Brassica campestris</em>\
    \ f. <em>biennis</em> DC. \xD7 <em>B. rapa</em> L.) as green-manure on the physiological\
    \ state of plants, allelopathic and biochemical characteristics of the soil in\
    \ monoculture conditions of lilac (<em>Syringa vulgaris</em> L.).\n\n<strong>Material\
    \ and methods</strong>. Seedlings of lilac were grown for 18 months under greenhouse\
    \ conditions in pots with gray forest soil after monoculture of <em>S. vulgaris</em>.\
    \ Biomass of brown mustard and tyfon was added to the soil jointly and separately\
    \ in different concentrations (2.5 and 5.0 % by soil weight). The allelopathic\
    \ activity, redox potential, the content of phenolic compounds and humus in soil,\
    \ the concentration of the main photosynthetic pigments in leaves and seedlings\
    \ growth were determined.\n\n<strong>Results</strong>. Application of green-manure\
    \ contributed to increased humification, reduced soil phytotoxicity and the content\
    \ of phenolic compounds, optimization of redox processes, increased chlorophyll\
    \ and carotenoids concentrations in the leaves, and stimulation of seedlings growth.\
    \ The formation of adaptive reactions of the pigment complex aimed at stabilizing\
    \ the photosynthetic apparatus was found.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>. The\
    \ positive influence of brown mustard and tyfon as green-manure on the allelopathic\
    \ and biochemical characteristics of the soil, as well as the physiological state\
    \ of <em>S. vulgaris</em> plants in the conditions of the allelopathic soil sickness\
    \ was established."
