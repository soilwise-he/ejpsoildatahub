  title: Investigation Of Heavy Metal Contamination In The Roadside Soil At Morena
    District In India
  abstract: "<strong><em>Pollution of natural environment due to release of heavy\
    \ metals from various sources is a widespread problem throughout the world. This\
    \ study explains the effect of heavy metal contaminants in Roadside soil of Morena\
    \ district. Twelve air dried surface soil samples were collected from 50cm \u2013\
    \ 1m (point A) and twelve from 30m (point B) away from the roadside along a road\
    \ with a distance of 50 km. Heavy metals were found in both points with highest\
    \ concentration at 50cm \u2013 1m (point A). Roadside soil is a definite indicator\
    \ of vehicular pollution from where the high degree of contamination, is expected.\
    \ The presence of heavy metals like Cu, Cr, Fe, Pb, Zn and Mn in the roadside\
    \ soil was also considerable.</em></strong>"
