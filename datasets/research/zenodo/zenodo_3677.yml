  title: Biodegradation Of Polyhydroxybutyrate-Co- Hydroxyvalerate (Phbv) Blended
    With Natural Rubber In Soil Environment
  abstract: 'According to synthetic plastics obtained from petroleum cause some environmental
    problems. Therefore, degradable plastics become widely used and studied for replacing
    the synthetic plastic waste. A biopolymer of poly hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate
    (PHBV) is subgroups of a main kind of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Naturally,
    PHBV is hard, brittle and low flexible while natural rubber (NR) is high elastic
    latex. Then, they are blended and the biodegradation of the blended PHBV and NR
    films were examined in soil environment. The results showed that the degradation
    occurs predominantly in the bulk of the samples. The order of biodegradability
    was shown as follows: PHBV&gt; PHBV/NR&gt; NR. After biodegradation, the blended
    films were characterized by appearance analysis such as Scanning Electron Microscope
    (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning
    Calorimetry (DSC). It was found that the biodegradation mainly occurred at the
    polymer surface.'
