    \ April 2009, accepted 5 May 2010</em> Nitrogen and sulfur are among the various\
    \ Important macronutrients present in the soil which continuously<br> remain in\
    \ dynamic equilibrium in the soil-system while participating In essential biogeochemical\
    \ processes. The levels<br> of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), nitrate\
    \ (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) also\
    \ indicate soil fertility status. The approach of conventional<br> analytical\
    \ techniques for quantitative determination of inorganic ions restricts their\
    \ use for large number of samples<br> and <em>in situ</em> soil analysis. The\
    \ objective of this study was to develop a fast and non-destructive method for\
    \ quantitative<br> determination or inorganic cationic and anionic species, i.e.\
    \ NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>\
    \ in soil employing diffuse reflectance<br> Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy\
    \ (DRS-FTIR) with potassium bromide (KBr) matrix as background. The basis<br>\
    \ or determination of these Ions Is the selection of non-Interfering quantitative\
    \ vibrational peaks among the various observed<br> peaks for the different symmetry\
    \ types of the selected multi-atomic ionic units. The peaks at 3132 cm\xB71 (asymmetric<br>\
    \ stretching vibration, \u028B<sub>3</sub>), 1385 cm<sup>-1</sup> (asymmetric\
    \ stretching vibration, \u028B<sub>3</sub>) and 617 cm\xB7l (bending vibration,\
    \ \u028B<sub>4</sub>)<br> were selected for quantitative determinatIon of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,\
    \ NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\xB7</sup> respectively,\
    \ due to the simple reason of strong,<br> sharp signals and avoiding tile Interfering\
    \ peaks due to presence of other possible Ions in soil. The quunlilative analysis<br>\
    \ Has been done by preparing calibration curves by obtaining the peak areas for\
    \ a wide range of concentration at selected<br> peaks for respective Ions. The\
    \ concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and\
    \ SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were determined, by the present method, to be<br>\
    \ In the ranges 1.2-5.6, 16.3-23.8 and 11.4-24.3 \xB5g g<sup>-1</sup> respectively\
    \ in 8 different mixed featured loam type soil samples<br> collected randomly\
    \ and freshly from the surrounding areas of the city. The uncertainty in the determination,\
    \ in terms<br> of rel. std. dev. (n=10), were found to be In the range 2.16-4.82,\
    \ 1.08-3.73 and 1.97-4.12%, respectively for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,<br> NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\
    \ and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions. The present method has relatively very\
    \ high sample throughput as compared to ion-chromatographic<br> (IC) technique.\
    \ The work proposes a rapid, free or interferences, low cost and non-destructive\
    \ method employing DRS-FTIR<br> technique for characterization of key components\
    \ of soil viz. NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>."
