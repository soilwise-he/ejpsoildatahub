  title: Effects of Cassava Cultivation on Soil Quality Indicators in the Humid Forest
    Zone of Cameroon
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A study was conducted at Ongot in the humid forest zone (HFZ)
    of Cameroon to determine the extent to which selected soil quality indicators
    are affected by cassava cultivation along a chronosequence of 5, 10 and 20 years.
    Soil samples were collected from cassava farms along this chronosequence and from
    a nearby forest as reference. The samples were analyzed for soil organic matter
    (SOM), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH. SOM, OC and TN decreased
    significantly (P&lt;0.05) following years of cassava cultivation. Thus after 20
    years of cultivation, SOM and OC contents reduced by 50% compared to the reference
    (SOM=35.08 g kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, OC=20.39 g kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).
    TN decreased from 2.19 g kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;in the reference to
    1.24 g kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;in farms where cassava has been cultivated
    for 20 years. Soil pH ranged from 5.4 to 5.6 but did not differ (P&lt;0.05) irrespective
    of years of cassava cultivation. Generally, significant differences in soil quality
    indicators were not observed between the forest soil and soils from five-year
    old cassava farms. This could imply that management strategies to improve soil
    quality in the HFZ of Cameroon are warranted mainly after four years of cassava
    cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;'
