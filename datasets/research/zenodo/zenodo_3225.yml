  title: Long-term Effect of Integrated Nutrient Management on Chemical and Microbial
    Properties of Soil under Rice (Oryza sativa L.)-Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) System
    in an Acid Alfisol
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aims: &lt;/strong&gt;The aim of the investigation\
    \ was to see the long-term effect of integrated nutrient management (INM) on chemical\
    \ and microbiological properties of soil after 17 cycles of a rice-wheat cropping\
    \ system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place and Duration of Study:&lt;/strong&gt;\
    \ This study was carried out in an on-going long-term fertilizer experiment initiated\
    \ during 1991 at CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur, Himachal\
    \ Pradesh, India.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt;\
    \ The experiment comprised of 8 treatment combinations viz., N, P and K fertilizer\
    \ application as individual component and use of chemical fertilizers in conjunction\
    \ with different organic sources i.e. farm yard manure (FYM), wheat straw (WS),\
    \ and green manure (GM) with &lt;em&gt;Sesbania aculeata&lt;/em&gt; to substitute\
    \ 25 or 50% N through organics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;\
    \ The highest grain yield was 43.37 q ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in treatment\
    \ receiving 50% NPK + 50% N through FYM and lowest of 26.70 q ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ under control. The highest increase of organic carbon of about 55.2 per cent\
    \ over control was observed under treatment receiving 50% N substituted through\
    \ FYM during summer every year. Similarly, the highest soil microbial biomass\
    \ carbon (248.50 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), microbial biomass nitrogen (38.25\
    \ mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and respiratory activities (153 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ was observed in the same treatment.\_ Total nitrogen was highest (928 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ under 50% NPK + 50% N through green manure in summer followed by 100% NPK in\
    \ winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Application\
    \ of 50% N through organics plus 50% NPK through chemical fertilizers was better\
    \ than other treatments in improving chemical and microbiological properties of\
    \ soil and in sustaining the crop yields.&lt;/p&gt;"
