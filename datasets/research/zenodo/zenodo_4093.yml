  title: Effect of foliar spray with some safety materials on growth, productivity
    and tuber quality of potato under sandy soil conditions
  abstract: Two field experiment were carried out during the two successive summer
    seasons of 2018 and 2019 at Private Farm, Belbies Distrect, Sharkia Governorate,
    Egypt, to study the effect of foliar spray with some safety materials (salicylic
    acid, ascorbic acid, folic acid and cyanocolamin) on growth productivity and tuber
    quality of potato (<em>Solanum tuberosum </em>L<em>.</em>) cv. Spunta grown in
    loamy sandy soil. Spraying potato plant with Vit. B<sub>12</sub>, FA, Vit. C and
    SA at different levels single or in combinations increased dry weight of shoots
    / plant and leaf area compared to control. Spraying with Vit. B<sub>12</sub>,
    FA, Vit. C and SA in combination at 100 mg / l of each increased average tuber
    number / plant, yield / plant, marketable yield and total yield / fad as well
    as protein content in tubers. Spraying with with Vit. B12 at 150 mg / l or FA
    at 150 mg / l or Vit. C at 200 mg / l increased DM% and starch content in tubers.
    From this experiment, it could be concluded that, spraying with Vit. B<sub>12</sub>,
    FA, Vit. C and SA in combination at 100 mg / l of each increased yield / plant,
    marketable yield and total yield / fad as well as protein content in tubers, whereas
    spraying with Vit. C alone at 200 mg / l increased DM% and starch content in tubers.
