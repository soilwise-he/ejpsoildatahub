  title: Soil Properties Conducive to the Formation of Tuber aestivum Vitt. Fruiting
    Bodies
  abstract: 'Summer truffle (Tuber aestivum), also known as Burgundy truffle, is getting
    interest in Poland in terms of cultivation as a promising incentive for rural
    areas. Yet the occurrence of the fungus in wider scale in our country has been
    confirmed in the last decade. Ecological factors that determine the occurrence
    of T. aestivum are rather well known in the  Mediterranean region, whereas such
    knowledge is limited in northern Europe. The aim of this work was to find the
    correlations between essential nutrients in surface horizons of soils typical
    of truffle occurrence. The study area is situated

    in the Nida Basin in southern Poland. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed
    that active carbonate content is the variable that accounts for the greatest percentage
    of occupancy in the T. aestivum habitat. In this paper we propose that active
    carbonate is a major factor in the fruiting of summer truffle. The obtained results
    could have applications in natural harvesting and truffle culture'
