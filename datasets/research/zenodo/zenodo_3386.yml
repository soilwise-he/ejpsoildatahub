  title: Assessment Of Factors Influencing Infiltration  Capacity Of Soil
  abstract: The infiltration process is an important factor in the hydrological cycle,
    the phenomena deserves special attention in watershed management plan. The present
    study has been carried out to investigate the impact of soil surface characteristics
    and slope angle on infiltration rate. The factors influencing infiltration rate
    was studied using rainfall simulator for an experimental plot of 1980 sq.cm.,
    the duration of rainfall has been selected as 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively
    for the entire analysis. The infiltration was calculated from the values obtained
    from calibration run and test run. Infiltration capacity decreased in compacted
    soil and vegetative cover when compared to the loosely filled soil. Slope angle
    ranged from 50 to 150 was used to study the effect of infiltration capacity. Infiltration
    rate decreases with increase in slope angle. Further, it was observed that if
    intensity of rainfall is high surface runoff depth increases and infiltration
    rate decreases. Results strongly suggests that, for soil characteristics and slope
    angles as used here, adequate watershed protections may be developed in order
    to recharge the groundwater.
