  title: Microbial Fuel Cell Bio-Remediation of Lambda Cyhalothrin, Malathion and
    Chlorpyrifos on Loam Soil Inoculated with Bio-Slurry
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In microbial fuel cell technology, the substrate is consumed
    by microbes in anaerobic conversion of substrate to electricity. Bio-remediation
    of pollutants involves microbial environmental cleanup using green approach. The
    primary problems with pesticides are linked to the non-negligible proportion of
    the sprayed active ingredient that does not reach its intended target thereby
    contaminating environmental compartments persistently. The primary objective of
    this study was to assess the potential of microbial fuel cell technology in bio-remediation
    of lambda cyahlothrin, chlorpyrifos and malathion in Limuru loam soil. H-shaped
    double chamber microbial fuel cell was fabricated where the anodic chamber was
    loaded with 750 mL loam soil inoculated with 750 mL bio-slurry doped with 10 mL
    of 10 ppm lambda cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and malathion pesticide solutions.
    The cathodic chamber was loaded with 1500 mL distilled water. The setup was incubated
    for a 90 days retention time where voltage and current were recorded daily using
    a multi-meter. The degradation level was assessed using a GC-MS after sample extraction
    using standard QuEChERs method. The voltage generated from the pesticide doped
    loam soil showed an upward trend from day 0 to day 15 in lambda cyhalothrin and
    malathion and from day 0 to day 20 in chlorpyrifos and pesticide mixture after
    which constant readings were observed for three days with downward trends thereafter.
    The maximum generated voltage was 0.537 V, 0.571 V, 0.572 V and 0.509 V in chlorpyrifos,
    lambda cyhalothrin, malathion and pesticide mix (MCL) respectively. The bioremediation
    levels for chlorpyrifos and malathion were 65.80 % and 71.32 %, respectively while
    no detectable, lambda cyhalothrin was observed after day 60 of the study. This
    study concludes that bioremediation of lambda cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and malathion
    in Limuru loam soil can be achieved using microbial fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;'
