  title: The Relationship Of Biofilms And Physicochemical Properties Of Soil Samples
    With Corrosion Of Water Pipelines In Minna, Niger State, Nigeria
  abstract: This study investigated the relationship of biofilms and physicochemical
    properties of soil samples with corrosion of water pipelines in Barkin-Sale, Bosso,
    Chanchaga, Keteren-Gwari, Maikunkele and Kwangila areas of Minna metropolis. Corroded
    water pipes and soil samples were analysed for microbiological and physicochemical
    properties and their influence on corrosion correlated between the months of February
    and July, 2008. The corrosion products detected in the soil samples were sulphide
    and phosphide. The mean concentration of sulphide ranged from 1020 to 3033ppm
    and that of phosphide ranged from 13.50 to 22.58ppm. The mean organic carbon ranged
    from 0.35 to 0.89%, mean organic matter ranged from 0.62 to 1.57%, mean pH ranged
    from 6.73 to 7.70 and mean moisture ranged from 4.33 to 16.63%. There was a significant
    difference (P&lt;0.05) in the level of sulphide, phosphide, organic carbon, organic
    matter and moisture in the locations but there was no significant difference (P&gt;0.05)
    in their pH. The mean total aerobic bacterial counts ranged from 3.5x10<sup>3</sup>cfu/g
    to 7.2x10<sup>4</sup>cfu/g, mean total aerobic bacterial counts ranged from 3.0x10<sup>3</sup>cfu/g
    t0 5.6x10<sup>5</sup>cfu/g. total aerobic bacterial counts (TABC) was positively
    correlated with phosphide and negatively correlated with organic matter, pH, moisture,
    total fungal counts (TFC) and total anaerobic bacterial counts (TAnBC). The total
    anaerobic bacterial counts (TAnBC) was positively correlated with sulphide, phosphide,
    organic carbon, organic matter and pH while the total fungal counts (TFC) was
    positively correlated with sulphide, organic carbon, organic matter, pH and moisture
    and negatively correlated with phosphide total aerobic bacterial counts and total
    anaerobic bacterial counts
