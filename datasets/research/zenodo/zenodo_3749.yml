  title: 'Reclaimed Water Project: Effects of High Na Concentration in Soil and Plant
    Tissues'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Clark Water Corporation (CWC) intends to reclaim its treated
    wastewater (WW) for turf grass irrigation in golf courses and other urban landscapes.
    CWC&rsquo;s treated effluent meets the DA (DAO 26) irrigation standard except
    for sodium which exceed by an average of 17%; creating the need to study the effects
    of high Na concentration of WW in soils and plant tissues. Soil samples were compiled
    from 3 sites; 2 from target irrigation sites, P.Balagtas and Korea CC and 1 from
    the final pond of the Wastewater Treatment Plant&rsquo;s (WWTP) to replicate long-time
    irrigated soils. Soils were transferred to experimental plots, planted with foliage
    and irrigated for 5 months with equal amounts of WW. Results indicate that soils
    from the target sites are fine grained sandy soils and that WW irrigation have
    improved their structure and porosity. Calcium and magnesium levels spiked with
    calcium increasing 60 folds while magnesium levels surging by more than 1000 folds.
    Soil sodium levels increased by an average of 70% while organic content dropped
    by an average of 119%. Variances between the former and latter parameters were
    more prominent with the Korea CC soils. Planted foliage have exhibited tolerance
    from the high sodium content of irrigation water. Foliage taken from the Korea
    CC plots generally performed better in the uptake of nutrients as compared to
    those harvested from P. Balagtas. Disturbingly, all harvested foliage exhibited
    uptake of arsenic which can be attributed to soil background contamination. Although
    it cannot be inferred in the experiment, potential problems associated with long-term
    nutrient build up may arise. Ideally, these effects can be countered by the amount
    of rainfall and its associated leeching. This anticipation is backed-up by the
    lack of sodium accumulation from 3rd soil sample taken in proximity of the WWTP
    final pond.&lt;/p&gt;'
