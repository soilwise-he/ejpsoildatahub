  title: Study on Soil-Foundation Interaction under a Bridge Pier
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the behaviour of soil foundation interaction
    under a bridge pier. In 2016, August 25, a magnitude of 6.8 happened near Bagan
    region. Pakokku Bridge, the longest of the bridges over the Irrawaddy, is situated
    on 37.8 miles from the epicentre of 2016 Chauk earthquake. That is why the safety
    performance of long span Bridge especially for the safety of the foundation system
    subjected to soil foundation interaction is necessary to investigate for static
    and seismic excitation. So, study on the behaviour of soil foundation interaction
    under Bridge pier in static condition is presented in this study. Firstly super
    structural loadings on the pile cap are estimated by using STAAD PRO V8i. And
    then, theoretical ultimate soil resistance pcr and pcd due to wedge and flow failure
    are determined to produce critical depth xcr. Based on the value of critical depth,
    p y curves are generated by Reese 1974 method for the static condition. After
    that, finite element software ABAQUS is used for the analysis of soil foundation
    interaction under a bridge pier. In this study, the behaviour of soil foundation
    interaction such as deflections, settlements, shear stresses and shear strains
    are produced. According to the analysis results, it is found that the vertical
    and horizontal displacements at the pile tip are 1.27mm and 4.68mm respectively.
    Maximum shear stress and strain are found out the base of the pile cap. Finally
    it is found that the soil foundation interaction under a bridge pier presented
    in this study is reliable and reasonable with the limitation of AASHTO Standard
    Specifications for Highway Bridges. Zin May Hnin | Nyan Myint Kyaw | Kyaw Kyaw
