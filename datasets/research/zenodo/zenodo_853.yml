  title: Influence of Curing on Deformation of Asphalt Stabilized Subgrade Soil
  abstract: "Soil stabilization with liquid asphalt binder can enhance the required\
    \ strength properties of the subgrade after proper curing period to allow for\
    \ evaporation of volatiles from the binder. In the present assessment, an attempt\
    \ has been made to stabilized subgrade soil with cutback asphalt. Specimens of\
    \ 100 mm diameter and 63 mm height have been prepared at optimum cutback asphalt\
    \ requirement and at 0.5 % cutback higher and lower than the optimum. Specimens\
    \ were separated into two groups. The first group was cured for seven days at\
    \ the laboratory environment while the second group was cured for 30 days. Both\
    \ groups of specimens were subjected to repeated double punching shear application\
    \ for 1800 load repetitions at the Pneumatic Repeated Load System (PRLS) at 20\xB0\
    C. The deformation variables (total, resilient and permanent) were monitored by\
    \ Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT). It was observed that the total\
    \ deformation after 30 days curing declines after one load repetition by (25 and\
    \ 20) % for (16.5 and 16) % Cutback respectively when compared to the mixtures\
    \ after seven days curing. The resilient deformation at failure declines after\
    \ 30 days of curing by (1.2, 15.5, and 8) % for mixtures with (16.5, 16, and 15.5)\
    \ % cutback asphalt respectively as compared with mixtures practiced seven days\
    \ of curing. Asphalt stabilized mixture with 16 % cutback exhibit lower permanent\
    \ deformation of 71.5 % after 30 days curing as compared with that mixture cured\
    \ for seven days. It was concluded that curing period is vital in the gain of\
    \ resistance to deformation of asphalt stabilized subgrade soil. The resilient\
    \ deformation is (2 to 7) folds higher than the permanent deformation for asphalt\
    \ stabilized soil and increases as the binder content rises."
