  title: 'Surface and Deep Soil 222Rn Gas Exhalation Comparison: A Case Study in Tawke,
    Duhok, Northern Iraq'
  abstract: "In this study, 13 different surface locations and 20 mud samples were\
    \ collected during drilling, from one of the oil wells in the Kurdistan region\
    \ of Iraq. The samples were taken at different well depths. RAD7 technique was\
    \ used for finding the radon concentration. The smallest values in soil and surface\
    \ were 14.12\xB18.59 and 16\xB14.24Bq/m3 and the highest were 93.25+21.72 and\
    \ 137\xB18.76Bq/m3 respectively. The difference in the depth and surface formation\
    \ shows the surface formation over depth ratio. The exhalation rate recorded value\
    \ of the surface was generally higher than that of the depth formations. The exhalation\
    \ results were finally compared with the recommended values of the International\
    \ Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) levels. The data show that it was less than the\
    \ standards of IAEA."
