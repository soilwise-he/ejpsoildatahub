  title: The Efficiency Of Complex Application Of Vermiculture And Biological Products
    Baikal, Vostok, Tamir For Soil Purification From Fuel Oil
  abstract: "A technology has been developed for the recultivation of soils contaminated\
    \ with fuel oil in Western Siberia using microbiological preparations and earthworms.\
    \ Earthworms have great potential for removing hydrocarbons from the soil. The\
    \ results allow evaluating the effectiveness of bioremediation of polluted soils.\
    \ The method of cleaning and restoring the ecological functions of substrates\
    \ contaminated with fuel oil and other petroleum products was that the substrate\
    \ was treated with biologics, spent soil treatment was carried out and steamed\
    \ for one month, then the earthworms were applied. In the process of soil recultivation,\
    \ the drug Tamir together with the earthworms of E. fetida proved to be well proven\
    \ \u2014 the effectiveness of 80\u201382%. The drug Vostok had low efficiency\
    \ of reclamation with all types of earthworms."
