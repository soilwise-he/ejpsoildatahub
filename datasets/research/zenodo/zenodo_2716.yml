  title: Carbone and Visual Structure Indicators in Soil Health Assessment After No-Till
    Adoption Under Agro-Pedological Context in Algeria
  abstract: 'Soil health indicators are a set of measurable and interpretable chemical,
    physical and biological parameters related to soil functional processes that can
    be used to assess the state of soil health under different agroecosystems. Multiple
    indicators are examined in the case of soil health assessment after adoption no-till
    system such as, total carbon and its fractions, nitrogen, bulk density, aggregate
    stability and infiltration of water. In this chapter, we use organic carbon (particulate,
    associated and microbial) and visual structure indicators to assess soil health
    after a short and long duration of adoption no-till by depth under agro-pedo-climate
    context in Algeria. Three plots submitted in NT to different transition durations
    (3, 6 and 9 years) and a control plot submitted in CT were studied. Soil samples
    were taken at two depths (H1: 0-10 and H2: 10-20 cm). Analytical results showed
    that indicators in the surface horizon were significantly (p&lt;0.05) improved
    by increasing the NT transition duration, especially during the longest transition
    durations. The particulate organic carbon is the most sensitive soil indicator
    of the gradual no-till transition. The multiple correlation study showed that
    the evolution of the selected soil indicators is similar between the transition
    durations (3, 6 and 9 years) in H1. Or, in H2, the evolution of these indicators
    is similar only between the 6 and 9 year transition durations'
