  title: 'Water retention characteristics of mineral forest soils in Finland: impacts
    for modeling soil moisture'
  abstract: Soil hydraulic properties are central for soil quality and affect forest
    productivity and impacts of climate-change on forests. The water retention characteristics
    (WRC) of mineral forest soils in Finland are not well known and practical tools
    to predict them are lacking. We statistically analyzed mineral forest soils WRC
    from over 130 sites in Finland, focusing on the humus layer and main root zone
    (0-19 cm depth). We showed that mineral forest soils can be grouped to five WRC
    classes that are well predictable from soil bulk density, organic matter content
    and clay fraction. However, majority of the forest soils are hydrologically rather
    similar. We found that neither topsoil maps nor any combination of open geospatial
    data was able to predict WRC. Thus, in absence of site-specific soil data, parameterizing
    WRC as a function of forest site type was proposed. We demonstrated the approach
    in soil moisture modeling at a small forest headwater catchment and showed soil
    moisture response to weather conditions is jointly affected by WRC, stand attributes
    and topography. We showed drought risks are highest on dense mature forests at
    nutrient poor sites, and lower in young stands on peatlands and lowland herb-rich
    sites with groundwater influence. The results improve hydrological predictions
    for Finnish forests, and the open dataset can contribute to larger synthesis and
    development of boreal forest soil pedo-transfer functions.
