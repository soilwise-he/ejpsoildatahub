  title: Comparative Ameliorative Potentials of Surfactants on some Physico-Chemical
    properties of Soil Impacted with Crude oil in Okarki Community of Ahoada West
    Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigated the comparative remediation\
    \ potentials of <em>Pleurotus ostreatus</em> and triton x-100 on some physico-chemical\
    \ properties of crude oil impacted soil. Crude oil highly impacted soil excavated\
    \ from an oil spill site at Okarki community in Ahoada West Local Government Area\
    \ of Rivers State, Nigeria was used. Remediation was induced using white rot fungus\
    \ (<em>Pleurotus ostreatus</em>) and chemical surfactant (Triton x-100). Five\
    \ experimental cells (20cm diameter x 20cm high polypropylene bags) labelled A-G,\
    \ each containing 2kg of polluted soil was used and the different surfactants\
    \ added in various concentrations as shown in the experimental design. After amendment/inoculation,\
    \ each of the polypropylene bags was thoroughly mixed and tied with masking tape.\
    \ All the bags were incubated at 28 \xB1 2<sup>o</sup>C for 60 days. After the\
    \ incubation period the soil samples were analyzed for various parameters. The\
    \ pH value of polluted soil sample (Cell A) was high (6.87\xB1 0.67) when compared\
    \ with other cells that were amended. A significant reduction was observed in\
    \ cells C and D (5.70 \xB1 0.00 and 6.06 \xB1 0.01) amended with 200g of <em>Pleurotus\
    \ ostreatus</em> and 3ml of Triton x-100 respectively. After 60 days of incubation\
    \ with the amendments used, there was an observed significant difference (<em>p</em>\u2264\
    \ 0.05) when all the cells are compared with cell A for total organic carbon content\
    \ with an observed remarkable increase down the cells. Cells B, C, D, and E had\
    \ high values of 3.25 \xB1 0.05, 3.50 \xB1 0.07, 3.78 \xB1 0.08 and 3.74 \xB1\
    \ 0.09 respectively when compared with cell A (1.70 \xB1 0.01). The same trend\
    \ was observed for the total nitrogen content where all the cells were significantly\
    \ different (<em>p</em>\u2264 0.05) when compared with cell A and were increased\
    \ down the cells. For PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (mg/kg) and NO<sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub>\
    \ (mg/kg), all the cells were significantly different (<em>p</em>\u2264 0.05)\
    \ and there was a recognized decrease in their values when compared with the control\
    \ sample (Cell A). Organic Sulphur value reduced exponentially in all the cells\
    \ (0.12 \xB1 0.00) when compared with the control cell (A) (18.00 \xB1 0.00).\
    \ There were significant and swift increase in the soil total heterotrophic bacteria\
    \ count (THB) in cells B to E with the highest increase seen in cell D (CISS +\
    \ 3ml Triton x-100) (12.0x10<sup>7</sup>) when compared with the control sample.\
    \ Cells B to E had an increased THF count with cell B (CISS + 100g <em>Pleurotus\
    \ ostreatus</em>) having the highest value when compared with the control cell.\
