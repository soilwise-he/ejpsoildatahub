  title: BIOREMEDIATION OF CRUDE OIL CONTAMINATED SOIL BY HYDROCARBON DEGRADING BACTERIA
  abstract: "Proficiency of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria useful for eradicating\
    \ soil pollution stimulated by seepage of petroleum and their derivative substances,\
    \ therefore, sequestered different bacterial isolates were bear significant merits\
    \ for utilizing hydrocarbons as an uncommon source of their growth and development.\
    \ A colorimetric assay was performed at 595 nm wavelength which was subjected\
    \ to the mineral salt broth with 1% oil (petrol, diesel, and burned out engine\
    \ oil). This broth having minimum nutrients used by inoculated bacteria in which\
    \ some isolates were adopted for taking a sufficient amount of either petrol,\
    \ diesel, or burned-out engine oil as carbon source hence increases its turbidity\
    \ that was measured in two days time interval up to twelve days of observation.\
    \ We found that selected isolates were able to degrade burned out engine oil efficiently\
    \ in contrast to petrol and diesel. At optical density 0.21\xB1 0.13, 0.19\xB1\
    0.08, 0.18\xB10.09, 0.17\xB10.12 the result showed by isolatesBI-7, BI-2, BI-4,\
    \ BI-6goodcompetency to degrade burned out engine oil. On the other hand, maximum\
    \ diesel and petrol utilized by BI-2 &amp; BI-1 isolate at O.D. 0.09\xB10.02,\
    \ 0.05\xB10.02 was recorded. Most of the bacterial isolates resulted in a positive\
    \ biochemical test. BI-1 &amp; BI-7 resulted in positive starch hydrolysis test,\
    \ whereas, all isolates resulted in positive urease test, simultaneously negative\
    \ results for all isolates obtained when catalase and antibiotic sensitivity test\
    \ against streptomycin were performed."
