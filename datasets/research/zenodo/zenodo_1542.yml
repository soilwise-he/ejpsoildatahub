  title: Structure And Function Of Soil Fauna Communities In Amazonian Anthropogenic
    And Natural Ecosystems
  abstract: The soil biological conditions of two 5-year-old polyculture tree plantations
    in Amazonia were studied comparatively to a 13-year-old secondary forest and a
    nearby undisturbed primary forest. The polycultures had been planted to regenerate
    the soil degraded by land preparation and a former rubber tree monoculture. Abundance
    and biomass of functional groups of soil meso- and macrofauna were measured at
    three-months-intervals over 2 years and litterbag experiments with fauna exclusion
    were carried out. This paper concentrates on the description of the structure
    of the soil fauna communities, forming the background for an evaluation of the
    decomposition processes in polyculture plantations. Decomposition rates were strongly
    determined by the macrofauna particularly in primary forest, where large earthworms,
    termites and ants dominated the soil fauna. In the plantations, where litter originated
    predominantly from the non-planted, adventitious vegetation, an abundant decomposer
    fauna was found, in which however other groups or species dominated. Although
    decomposition rates in the plantations were about 60 % lower and soil biological
    variables like organic matter-, nitrogen-content and water holding capacity were
    slightly lower than in the primary forest, conditions seem favourable for a manipulation
    of the soil fauna by management of secondary vegetation and litter quantities.
