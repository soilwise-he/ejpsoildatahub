  title: Environment-Monitoring IoT Devices Powered by a TEG Which Converts Thermal
    Flux between Air and Near-Surface Soil into Electrical Energy
  abstract: "Energy harvesting has an essential role in the development of reliable\
    \ devices for environmental<br> wireless sensor networks (EWSN) in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), without considering<br> the need to replace discharged batteries.\
    \ Thermoelectric energy is a renewable energy source that<br> can be exploited\
    \ in order to efficiently charge a battery. The paper presents a simulation of\
    \ an<br> environment monitoring device powered by a thermoelectric generator (TEG)\
    \ that harvests energy<br> from the temperature difference between air and soil.\
    \ The simulation represents a mathematical<br> description of an EWSN, which consists\
    \ of a sensor model powered by a DC/DC boost converter via<br> a TEG and a load,\
    \ which simulates data transmission, a control algorithm and data collection.\
    \ The<br> results section provides a detailed description of the harvested energy\
    \ parameters and properties<br> and their possibilities for use. The harvested\
    \ energy allows supplying the load with an average<br> power of 129.04 W and maximum\
    \ power of 752.27 W. The first part of the results section examines<br> the process\
    \ of temperature differences and the daily amount of harvested energy. The second\
    \ part<br> of the results section provides a comprehensive analysis of various\
    \ settings for the EWSN device\u2019s<br> operational period and sleep consumption.\
    \ The study investigates the device\u2019s number of operational<br> cycles, quantity\
    \ of energy used, discharge time, failures and overheads."
