  title: The Effect of N, P, K and Si Fertilizers on Some Soil Chemical Properties,
    N, P uptake and Growth of Black Rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) in Ultisols
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nThis study aims to determine the effect of the combination\
    \ of fertilizers N, P, K, and Si on the pH, N-total, Al-dd, N, P- uptake, and\
    \ grown of black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) in Ultisols from Jasinga. This\
    \ research was conducted from October 2021 to January 2022 at the Experimental\
    \ Land for Soil Chemistry and Plant Nutrition in Jatinangor, Faculty of Agriculture,\
    \ Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Sumedang, West Java with an altitude of\
    \ 752 meters above sea level. The experimental design was carried out using a\
    \ Randomized Block Design (RAK) consisting of eight treatments and three replications,\
    \ consisting of: control; 1 N, P, K \_without Silica; 1 N, P, K + \xBD Silica;\
    \ 1 N, P, K + 1 Silica; 1 N, P, K + 2 Silica; \xBE N, P, K + 1 Silica; \xBE N,\
    \ P, K + 1\xBD Silica; \xBE N, P, K + 2 Silica; and without N, P, K + 2 Silica.\
    \ The results showed that the combination of fertilizer doses of 1 N, P, K (Urea\
    \ 300 kg/ha, SP-36 100 kg/ha, and KCl 100 kg/ha) with 1 Silica (2 mL/L) gave the\
    \ best black rice yields in increasing plant height by 60.34 cm and number of\
    \ tillers 34, plus those dose is the best dose in increasing soil pH by 5.63,\
    \ but the fertilizer dose was not able to increase soil P-Availability and N-Total."
