  title: Soil-ecological conditions of the north taiga flat-mound bog, Western Siberia
  abstract: "Of particular interest in the north of Western Siberia are frozen flat-mound\
    \ bogs. Being formed in a transitional climatic zone, on the southern front of\
    \ the permafrost zone, these frozen peatlands may turn out to be highly reactive\
    \ upon thawing and deliver high amounts of solutes to the hydrological network.\
    \ A detailed study of a flat-mound bog was carried out in a key area of about\
    \ 3 hectares (Purovsky district, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug). The soil-ecological\
    \ conditions of the site are described, as well as the effect of spatial heterogeneity\
    \ on the composition and properties of soils. Using topographic mapping and photogrammetry,\
    \ it was identified that the bog surface is characterized by distinct microtopography\
    \ (mounds-hollows-thermokarst subsidence with a percentage areas ratio of 49:30:21,\
    \ respectively). Small-scale variations in ecohydrological settings, microtopography,\
    \ and vegetation affect the distribution of nutrients, organic carbon in soils,\
    \ and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in bog waters. The main soil types are Dystric\
    \ Hemic Cryic Histosols and Dystric Hemic Histosols (Gelic) found on mounds and\
    \ in subsidence, respectively. If the peat thickness decreases to 40\u201360 cm,\
    \ then Spodic Histic Turbic Cryosols (Albic, Arenic) and Histic Turbic Cryosols\
    \ (Albic, Arenic) form. In hollows and fens, Dystric Epifibric Histosols, Spodic\
    \ Histic Turbic Cryosols (Arenic), and Gleyic Histic Entic Podzols (Turbic) are\
    \ the most common. The proportion of soils with frozen peat is no more than 20%\
    \ of the area of the key site and permafrost lies deeper, in the underlying rocks.\
    \ It was found that carbon stocks within the key area vary from 31.1 to 91.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\
    \ The maximum values are observed in transit subsidences/hollows between mounds,\
    \ where water is discharged. Concentrations of macro-microelements in bog waters\
    \ vary depending on microform types. For some elements (e.g., DOC, Fe, Al, B,\
    \ Si, Ti, V, Rb, Sb, Cs, REEs (rare earth elements), Pb, Th, U), they are approximately\
    \ equal or 1.5\u20132 higher on the mounds. The export of DOC and other elements\
    \ in permafrost areas is primarily controlled by the residence time of water and\
    \ movement ways along the profile. In addition to this, the physicochemical properties\
    \ of peat and biomass, which are also higher on mounds, influence the distribution\
    \ and accumulation of nutrients.<br>"
