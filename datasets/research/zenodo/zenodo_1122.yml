  title: Soil Moisture Influence on the FTIR Spectrum of Salt-Affected Soils
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil salinity has a major impact on agricultural production.\
    \ In a changing climate with&lt;br&gt;\nrising sea-levels, low-lying coastal areas\
    \ are increasingly inundated whereby saltwater gradually&lt;br&gt;\ncontaminates\
    \ the soil. Drought prone areas may suffer from salinity due to high evapotranspiration&lt;br&gt;\n\
    rates in combination with the use of saline irrigation water. Salinity is difficult\
    \ to monitor because soil&lt;br&gt;\nmoisture affects the soil&rsquo;s spectral\
    \ signature. We conducted Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy&lt;br&gt;\n\
    on alluvial and sandy soil samples in the coastal estuary of the Red River Delta.\
    \ The soils are&lt;br&gt;\ncontaminated with NaCl, Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 salts. In\
    \ an experiment of salt contamination, we&lt;br&gt;\nestablished that three ranges\
    \ of the spectrum were strongly influenced by both salt and moisture&lt;br&gt;\n\
    content in the soil, at wavenumbers 3200&ndash;3400 cm\U001000001 (2.9&ndash;3.1\
    \ m); 1600&ndash;1700 cm\U001000001 (5.9&ndash;6.3 m);&lt;br&gt;\n900&ndash;1100\
    \ cm\U001000001 (9.1&ndash;11.1 m). The Na2CO3 contaminated soil and the spectral\
    \ value had a linear&lt;br&gt;\nrelationship between wavelengths 6.9 and 7.4 m.\
    \ At wavelength 6.99 m, there was no relationship&lt;br&gt;\nbetween absorbance\
    \ and soil moisture, but the absorbance was proportional to the salt content&lt;br&gt;\n\
    (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.68 g) and electrical conductivity (R2 = 0.50; RMSE = 3.8\
    \ dS/m). The relationship&lt;br&gt;\nbetween soil moisture and spectral absorbance\
    \ value was high at wavelengths below 6.7 m, resulting&lt;br&gt;\nin a quadratic\
    \ relation between soil moisture and absorbance at wavelength 6.13 m (R2 = 0.80;&lt;br&gt;\n\
    RMSE = 5.2%). The spectral signatures and equations might be useful for mapping\
    \ salt-affected soils,&lt;br&gt;\nparticularly in difficult to access locations.\
    \ Technological advances in thermal satellite sensors may&lt;br&gt;\noffer possibilities\
    \ for monitoring soil salinity.&lt;/p&gt;"
