  title: Evaluation of Soil and Climatic Conditions Supporting Maize (Zea mays L.)
    Production in Makurdi, Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The aim was to evaluate the suitability of the soils for the\
    \ production of maize and to have a detailed soil database for effective land\
    \ use planning. Soil requirements for maize were collected from past research\
    \ works and compared with data obtained from the field survey. The study showed\
    \ that the soils of the area had formed under climatic environment presently characterized\
    \ by an annual rainfall of about 1330.20 mm and a mean annual temperature of about\
    \ 27.80\xB0C. The soils of the upper slope were classified as &lt;em&gt;Typic\
    \ Paleustalfs,&lt;/em&gt; while those of the middle and lower slopes were classified\
    \ as &lt;em&gt;Typic Haplustalfs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Typic Kandiaqualfs&lt;/em&gt;\
    \ respectively, using soil taxonomy. The soils were well drained to poorly drained.\
    \ The clay content ranged from 7.20 to 29.30, increasing with depth. Organic carbon\
    \ was low (0.47%) in the upland and relatively high (0.86%) in the low land. The\
    \ suitability assessment results showed that although, certain qualities or characteristics\
    \ such as mean annual temperature, relative humidity and base saturation were\
    \ optimum for maize cultivation, there was however, no highly suitable (S1) land\
    \ for maize cultivation in the area. All the soils were classified into moderately\
    \ suitable (S2f) subclass due to their low nutrients levels. UAMTRF I and II Units\
    \ of the area were moderately suitable (S2tf) due to topography and low soil fertility.\
    \ UAMTRF III was limited by its imperfect drainage to marginally suitable subclasses\
    \ S3wf for maize production. To raise the productivity level of the lands for\
    \ optimal maize production, management techniques such as continuous organic matter\
    \ incorporation and mineral fertilizers application, and efficient use of mineral\
    \ fertilizers with low levels of chemical inputs with adaption of appropriate\
    \ irrigation techniques (in lowlands) would make dry season farming sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;"
