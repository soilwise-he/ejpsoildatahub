  title: Spatial Variability Of Soil Properties In Yakurr Local Government Area, Southeast
    Nigeria
  abstract: "The status and spatial variability of soil properties across agrarian\
    \ communities in Yakurr Local Government Area, Southeast Nigeria were assessed\
    \ and soil management strategies suggested for limiting soil properties. Nine\
    \ communities were identified within the study area and soil samples collected\
    \ from young fallow lands measuring 40 m by 40 m at depths of 0 \u2013 20 cm and\
    \ 20 \u2013 40 cm to represent surface and subsurface soils respectively. The\
    \ interpolation of the area was done using the deterministic methods of inverse\
    \ distance weighting (IDW) in ArcGIS 10.2.2 software. The soils were sandy loam\
    \ to loamy sand with the coefficients of variation (CV) of particle sizes ranked\
    \ as clay&gt; silt&gt; sand while soil pH ranged between 5.2 and 5.75, and organic\
    \ matter ranged from 7.4 in Ntamkpo to 20.3 gkg<sup>-1</sup> in Idomi with CV\
    \ of 27.54%. Total N was generally low in the soils with CV of 31.25% in the surface\
    \ soils and 58.36% in the subsurface soils. Available P and exchangeable basic\
    \ cations were rated low but with high CVs except for exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>\
    \ and Na<sup>+</sup> and ranked as P&gt; Mg&gt; Ca&gt; Na&gt; K. The ECEC was\
    \ however rated medium with CV of 23.8% in the surface soils. It was however observed,\
    \ that ECEC and organic matter were among the most spatially variable properties\
    \ in the area. Intensified soil tests and farmer education were suggested to control\
    \ the use of agrochemicals while unhealthy practices such as bush burning and\
    \ unplanned continuous cropping should be checked. The integrated use of calcitic\
    \ and dolomitic limes with organic inputs, crop rotation and bush fallow systems\
    \ were also advocated."
