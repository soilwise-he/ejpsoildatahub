  title: Experimental study of water infiltration on an unsaturated soil-geosynthetic
    system
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This investigation presents experimental results from soil-geosynthetic
    column tests constructed to study the drainage capability of geosynthetics installed
    within an unsaturated soil and subjected to a water infiltration process. Two
    different types of permeable geosynthetics were tested; namely, non-woven geotextile
    and woven non-woven geocomposite. The infiltration process was monitored using
    negative/positive pore water pressure and volumetric water content transducers
    placed above and below the geosynthetic. The results showed that the geosynthetics
    behaved as an impermeable layer until the surrounding soil was nearly saturated.
    The geosynthetics started draining water laterally only when the pore water pressure
    within the soil above it was positive or negative but close to zero. This study
    intends to provide some insights into the physics of soil-geosynthetics performance,
    and to complement the available technical data used to conduct numerical simulations
    of complex soil-structures subjected to water infiltration processes.&lt;/p&gt;'
