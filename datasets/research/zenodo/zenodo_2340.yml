  title: Investigation On Groundwater, Soil And Vegetation Quality With Special Reference
    To Heavy Metals Around Vrishabhavathi Valley, Bangalore
  abstract: 'In this study an investigation on groundwater, soil and vegetation quality
    with special reference to heavy metal around Vrishabhavathi valley, Bangalore
    was done. Total 35 number of groundwater samples are taken from the Vrishabhavathi
    valley at Kengeri, Bangalore, and studied for physicochemical parameters, heavy
    metals like copper, chromium, nickel. 8 numbers of soil samples are taken analyzed
    for heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Ni) by mehlich-1 extraction method, vegetation samples
    (Fenugreek leafs, Amaranthus leafs, Mint leafs, Spinach leafs, Radish) which are
    grown in the Vrishabhavathi wastewater are analyzed for heavy metals by using
    AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer) at Environmental Engineering Laboratory,
    BMSCE, Bangalore. Concentrations obtained for each of the samples were compared
    with the BIS is: 10500, 2012 for drinking water quality standard limits. All the
    concentrations of above analyzed samples like physicochemical parameters i.e.
    TDS, Conductivity, pH, Alkalinity, Calcium, Magnesium, Chloride, Nitrate, Hardness,
    and heavy metals i.e. Copper, Nickel, Chromium, are represented spatially  by
    using the specialized software called GIS (Geographic Information System) which
    represents the concentrations of each of the parameters spatially with respect
    to their sampling locations.'
