  title: Soil Stabilization using Fly Ash and Cotton Fiber
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mixing of fiber for ground improvement has been practiced for
    recent years. Many researches has shown the expected results. This paper mainly
    deals with the ground improvement technique using both Fly Ash and cotton fiber.
    The combination of them gives a satisfactory value of its practical application.
    Both Fly Ash and Cotton fiber are treated as waste materials in our country in
    spite of having its engineering significances. Here all the tests were performed
    accepting the Fly Ash percent is 10 for maximum bearing capacity of soil. Three
    types of sample were prepared as per 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 of cotton fiber. For instances,
    it deliberately increases the Dry Density of soil up to 48.05 KN m3 where as normal
    unreinforced soil sample gives about 22 KN m3. The Ultimate bearing capacity increases
    up to 80.65 Kpa whereas the unreinforced soil sample gives for 35 Kpa. The result
    of California Bearing Ratio CBR test gives desired value 23 than unreinforced
    soil 17 . The CBR test is performed only for 0.7 of cotton fiber where maximum
    stress is found. The most significant part in this study is to show the variation
    on cotton fiber for ground improvement technique at different ratio. This paper
    shows the gradual increase in Deviator stress for UCS tests for the increase in
    the percent of cotton fiber mixing with Fly Ash. This research may meet the need
    of ground having low strength at important sites. Tonmoy Kumar Brahmachary &quot;Soil
