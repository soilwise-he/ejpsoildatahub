  title: PROFILE DESCRIPTION AND SOIL SAMPLING PROTOCOLS FOR THE NATIONAL SOIL INVENTORY
    OF SCOTLAND (2007-2009)
  abstract: 'The National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS 1978-88) dataset was collected
    at locations arranged on a 10 km grid across the country. The soil and landscape
    at each sampling location are described and a wide range of soil properties are
    measured in the laboratory from soil samples taken at these locations. These include
    contextual information describing the surrounding landscape (such as slope and
    vegetation) and detailed chemical and physical analyses of each horizon (layer)
    within the soil profile. Between 2007 and 2009, 25% of these sites were revisited
    and resampled to: determine evidence of change in soil properties compare sampling
    methods measure new soil attributes to test their suitability as indicators of
    soil quality develop and test new methods for assessing soil quality These protocols
    outline the sampling procedures and the definitions for the recording of the environmental
    and morphological characteristics at each site. The document consists of two main
    parts: the protocols for recording site and morphological characteristics and
    the sampling protocols. Within the former, the document describes and defines
    the attributes used to describe the site; the soil morphological attributes of
    organic horizons and the soil morphological attributes of mineral horizons. Appendices
    show an example of the profile description profoma, the rock type codes and the
    horizon nomenclature. Related documentation (NSIS 1978-88) and a paper outlining
    changes in soil carbon stocks are also available ( DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4650230
    and <em>https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12041</em><em>). The work was funded by the
    Scottish Government.</em>'
