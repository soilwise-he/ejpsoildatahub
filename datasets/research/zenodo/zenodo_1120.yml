  title: The Response of Lignocellulosic Perennial Grasses to Different Soil Water
    Availability
  abstract: The Mediterranean climate is a climate change hot spot suffering by increasing
    drought periods during summer, with low rainfall and high evapotranspiration,
    which are limiting conditions for plant CO2 assimilation and biomass production,
    particularly for spring-summer crops. This would be even worst under marginal
    lands, where climatic, terrain and other limiting factors will further aggravate
    growing conditions and productivity. The present field experiment investigated
    the response to irrigation of several lignocellulosic perennial grasses. Plant
    stem density, stem height, stem weight and leaf area index were evaluated during
    the growing season with a monthly frequency. Stem density showed the lowest values
    for A. donax genotypes and the highest for the Miscanthus seed-based hybrids.
    High stem densities are observed at high irrigation levels. Stem height and weight
    are inversely correlated to stem density. A. donax genotypes had higher stem height
    and weight than the other genotypes. Irrigation has a significant positive effect
    on both measures. Leaf area index varied among genotypes, and irrigation increased
    this trait.
