  title: Comparison Of Different Techniques To Estimate Surface Soil Moisture
  abstract: "Land subsidence is a gradual settling or sudden sinking of the land surface\
    \ from changes that take place underground. There are different causes of land\
    \ subsidence; most notably, ground-water overdraft and severe weather conditions.\
    \ Subsidence of the land surface due to ground water overdraft is caused by an\
    \ increase in the intergranular pressure in unconsolidated aquifers, which results\
    \ in a loss of buoyancy of solid particles in the zone dewatered by the falling\
    \ water table and accordingly compaction of the aquifer. On the other hand, exploitation\
    \ of underground water may result in significant changes in degree of saturation\
    \ of soil layers above the water table, increasing the effective stress in these\
    \ layers, and considerable soil settlements. This study focuses on estimation\
    \ of soil moisture at surface using different methods. Specifically, different\
    \ methods for the estimation of moisture content at the soil surface, as an important\
    \ term to solve Richard\u2019s equation and estimate soil moisture profile are\
    \ presented, and their results are discussed through comparison with field measurements\
    \ obtained from Yanco1 station in south-eastern Australia. Surface soil moisture\
    \ is not easy to measure at the spatial scale of a catchment. Due to the heterogeneity\
    \ of soil type, land use, and topography, surface soil moisture may change considerably\
    \ in space and time."
