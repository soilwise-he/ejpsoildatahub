  title: 'Identification of the relationship between temporally varying land surface
    temperature of winter season with the cover management factor of revised universal
    soil loss equation: A case study from upper Bakreshwar river basin'
  abstract: Identification of soil loss is a global concern as it increases the pollution
    and sedimentation in the concerned river or reservoir. Due to sedimentation not
    only the water storage capacity of the waterbody reduces but also the aqua life
    gets hampered. Several studies have been done on estimation of soil erosion using
    the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The RUSLE model shows the influence
    of impact of rain drop energy on top soil that causes erosion. The vegetation
    cover present on the top soil reduces the impact of raindrop energy and thus reduces
    the soil erosion. This factor is termed as cover management factor (C). From the
    detailed observation of satellite imageries of Bakreshwar watershed and Bakreshwar
    dam, lots of sedimentation has been observed in the Bakreshwar dam. In this study
    we have tried to identify the relationship (if any) between land surface temperature
    changes with the cover management factor of upper Bakreshwar river basin over
    a time of 30 years. The study area is located in Humid Subtropical climatic zone
    where the summer is hot and humid and winter is mild. So a change in temperature
    may cause a change in rainfall amount and in turn it may affect the cover management
    factor. From the study it has been observed that negative relationship prevails
    with temperature and cover management factor in the study area. As we are studying
    on winter data it prevails that the vegetation cover present in high surface temperature
    region than cold regions that can reduce the soil loss. This observation may help
    to future modification of cover management factor in RUSLE model by incorporating
    the land surface temperature in it.
