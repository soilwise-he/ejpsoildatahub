  title: Soil Determination using PH Nutrient Relatively
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;INDIA, an agriculture-based country where the economy is dependent
    on agriculture and climatic conditions. Primary reason of this project is to fulfil
    the needs of farming quality by reducing excessive fertilizer abuse by controlling
    some parameters. So, the parameters are temperature, moisture, light, Ph through
    which we can identify the suitable crop and its nutrition level. Our project uses
    3 types of sensors to increase productivity of the crops. Soil testing for productivity
    is taken by proposal of supplements needs. We are using Arduino UNO with the sensors.
    Determining the pH of soil is one of the key parameters for improving crop quality
    so the amount of the amount of fertilizer used is adequate and not excessive for
    the crops. Other main sensors used are light and hygrometer sensors. We can classify
    plants based on their light needs like high, medium or low. So, the light received
    by the crops depends upon the nearness of light. We should adequately address
    spatial variation for crop productivity when we consider pH to rejuvenate agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;'
