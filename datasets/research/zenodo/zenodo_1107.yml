  title: Pearl millet forage productivity under sprinkler irrigation system in sandy
    soil
  abstract: A field experiment was conducted in a private farm (30<sup>o</sup>40'
    N latitude, 32<sup>o</sup>15' E longitude, and 10.0 m above mean sea level), Ismailia
    Governorate, Egypt, during the 2020 and 2021 summer growing seasons. The aim was
    to study the effect of four irrigation treatments (125, 100, 75% ETo, and farmer
    practice) on pearl millet forage yield. Average amounts of applied irrigation
    water under 125, 100, 75% ETo and farmer practice were 4637, 3710, 2782, and 5950
    m<sup>3</sup>/ha, respectively with respective average water consumption values
    of 4130, 3308, 2482, and 5302 m<sup>3</sup>/ha. Compared to the farmer practice,
    the saved water was 22, 38, and 53 % for the 125, 100, and 75% ETo treatments.
    Average water use efficiency values were 7.91, 7.55, 6.96 and 4.59 kg/m<sup>3</sup>,
    and average water productivity values were 7.04, 6.73, 6.21, and 4.08 kg/m<sup>3</sup>
    for 125, 100, 75% ETo and farmer treatments, respectively. The Ky factor was 1.17
    indicating that the pearl millet crop is moderately sensitive to water stress.
    Irrigating pearl millet in sandy soils with 100% ETo will save 38% of applied
    irrigation water, achieve water use efficiency of 7.55 green yield/m<sup>3</sup>
    of water consumed, and water productivity of 6.73 kg green yield/m<sup>3 </sup>of
    water applied.
