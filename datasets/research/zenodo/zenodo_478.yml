  title: Remote Sensing Application in Soil Moisture Content Estimation
  abstract: <em>The knowledge of soil moisture is crucial to agriculture and other
    sectors such as, the construction industries. Precise estimation of spatial and
    temporal variation of soil moisture is vital for ecological and hydrological studies
    also. In recent times, remote sensing techniques have been used to estimate soil
    moisture. Estimation of soil moisture by remote sensing techniques provides only
    surface layer information and is unable to observe the entire soil. However, on
    the other hand, field measurement provides valuable information on both surface
    and subsurface soil moisture, but are insufficient to determine the spatial and
    temporal variability of soil moisture at a larger scale. Therefore, remote sensing
    methods have an edge over field methods. Soil moisture variations in time and
    space are due to the vegetation, topography and soil texture. This paper presents
    a comprehensive work in estimating soil moisture using Land surface temperature.
    The temperature was gotten using Landsat-8 thermal infrared band for Oredo Local
    Government Area and was used to determine the soil moisture of the area using
    ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.2.2).The map showed places with low, moderate and high moisture
    index with the moderate moisture content being the most dominant.</em>
