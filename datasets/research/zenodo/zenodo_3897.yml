  title: Soil Development in Hyper Density, its Types and Factors Effective on Design
    of Hyper Density Method
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Hyper density method is one of the methods for permanent development
    of soil without adding foreign matter to soil which means leaving heavy gavels
    on the height. The term hyper density is derived from dynamic density of coarse-grained
    soils and dynamic strength of fine-grained soils and because these two methods
    are generally equal, the term hyper density has replaced it. High dynamic density,
    low energy density and dynamic replacement and mixture (DRM) are among the hyper
    density methods. Factors effective on design of this method depend on two important
    factors which include: soil factors, work equipment factors.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
