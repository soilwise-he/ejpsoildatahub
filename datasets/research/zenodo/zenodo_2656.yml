  title: Spectra Fusion of Mid-Infrared (MIR) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy
    for Estimation of Selected Soil Fertility Attributes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Previous works indicate that data fusion, compared to single
    data modelling can improve the assessment of soil attributes using spectroscopy.
    In this work, two different kinds of proximal soil sensing techniques i.e., mid-infrared
    (MIR) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy were evaluated, for assessment
    of seven fertility attributes. These soil attributes include pH, organic carbon
    (OC), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and moisture
    contents (MC). Three kinds of spectra fusion (SF) (spectra concatenation) approaches
    of MIR and XRF spectra were compared, namely, spectra fusion-Partial least square
    (SF-PLS), spectra fusion-Sequential Orthogonalized Partial least square (SF-SOPLS)
    and spectra fusion-Variable Importance Projection-Sequential Orthogonalized Partial
    least square (SF-VIP-SOPLS). Furthermore, the performance of SF models was compared
    with the developed single sensor model (based on individual spectra of MIR and
    XRF). Compared with the results obtained from single sensor model, SF models showed
    improvement in the prediction performance for all studied attributes, except for
    OC, Mg, and K prediction. More specifically, the highest improvement was observed
    with SF-SOPLS model for pH [R 2p = 0.90, root mean square error prediction (RMSEP)
    = 0.15, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 3.30, and ratio of performance inter-quantile
    (RPIQ) = 3.59], successively followed by P (R 2p = 0.91, RMSEP = 4.45 mg/100 g,
    RPD = 3.53, and RPIQ = 4.90), Ca (R 2p = 0.92, RMSEP = 177.11 mg/100 g, RPD =
    3.66, and RPIQ = 3.22) and MC (R 2p = 0.80, RMSEP = 1.91%, RPD = 2.31, RPIQ =
    2.62). Overall the study concluded that SF approach with SOPLS attained better
    performance over the traditional model developed with the single sensor spectra,
    hence, SF is recommended as the best SF method for improving the prediction accuracy
    of studied soil attributes. Moreover, the multi-sensor spectra fusion approach
    is not limited for only MIR and XRF data but in general can be extended for complementary
    information fusion in order to improve the model performance in precision agriculture
    (PA) applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
