  title: Application Of Gis And Statistical Multivariate Techniques For Estimation
    Of Soil Erosion And Sediment Yield
  abstract: 'In recent years, most of the regions in the world are

    exposed to degradation and erosion caused by increasing

    population and over use of land resources. The understanding of

    the most important factors on soil erosion and sediment yield are

    the main keys for decision making and planning. In this study, the

    sediment yield and soil erosion were estimated and the priority of

    different soil erosion factors used in the MPSIAC method of soil

    erosion estimation is evaluated in AliAbad watershed in southwest

    of Isfahan Province, Iran. Different information layers of the

    parameters were created using a GIS technique. Then, a

    multivariate procedure was applied to estimate sediment yield and

    to find the most important factors of soil erosion in the model. The

    results showed that land use, geology, land and soil cover are the

    most important factors describing the soil erosion estimated by

    MPSIAC model.'
