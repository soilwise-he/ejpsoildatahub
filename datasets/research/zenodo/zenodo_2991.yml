  title: "Post-harvest Changes in the Status of Nitrogen and Organic Carbon in Soil\
    \ Treated with Fertilizers and Pesticides for Growing R\u03B1ph\u03B1nus s\u03B1\
    tivus"
  abstract: Chemical Laboratories, Allahabad University, Allahabad-211 002 NH<sub>3
    </sub>-N was found maximum in soils supplied with fertilizers only(C\(f\)) and
    pesticides were found to inhiblt the production and maintenance of NH<sub>3</sub>-N
    in soils. Fertilizers and pesticides showed increased percentage of NH<sub>3</sub>-N
    than the original level (OL), although natural soil showed more NH<sub>3</sub>-N
    than the treated soils. In presence of metasystox there was an increase in NH<sub>3</sub>-N
    percentage than the fertilizer (C\(f\)) and carbofuran treated (P) soils. Rate
    of nitrification was inhibited by the presence of fertilizers and pesticides.
    However, pesticides increased the rate of nitrification in the soils than fertilizers
    only. Organic carbon percentage was found to be maximum in the original level.
    Pesticide treated soils had a higher organic carbon level than the fertilizers
    treated soil.
