  title: Utilization of Salt Water Cord Grass Fibres for Stabilizing Kuttanad Soil
  abstract: The process of stabilizing soil has been practiced by our ancestors from
    time immortal and is continuing now also. Soil stabilization deals with different
    methods done for modifying the engineering properties of soil. In this work, properties
    of Kuttanad soil is improved by using Saltwater cord grass fibres of 2cm length
    and mean diameter 0.07cm. The tests performed include compaction and UCS tests.
    In order to stabilize soil, amount of fibre is kept constant as 0.5% and varying
    lime contents (2%, 4%, 6% &amp; 8%) is added to soil. The optimum lime content
    was 6%. The longevity of fibres is also evaluated by subjecting it to continuous
    immersion in water and lime solution.
