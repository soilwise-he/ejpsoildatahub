  title: Particle Size Analysis of Soil Obtainable in Maiduguri, Nigeria
  abstract: 'Soil is a substantial resource and displays adaptable physical, chemical,
    mineralogical, hydrological and geochemical properties. Particle size is a fundamental
    analysis procedure for soils, and pedological and paleopedological analysis. In
    view of this particle size distribution of soil samples were conducted and analysed
    for 10 locations in Maiduguri, Nigeria by sieving technique. Their sand, silt,
    and clay contents were determined. The distribution of particle size influences
    the moisture retention and transmission properties of soils. The overall result
    showed that the soil in Maiduguri is predominantly sand having low moisture retention
    and high permeability. This study at higher precision will be helpful for the
    textural management concerns all operations, practices and treatments used to
    protect soil and enhance its performance.Read Complete Article at ijSciences:
