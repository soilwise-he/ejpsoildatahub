  title: Laboratory evaluation of soil geotechnical properties via electrical conductivity
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the use of electrical methods has been improved
    considerably in several areas such as environment, agronomy, geophysics and geotechnics.
    Electrical resistivity may be used as a parameter in soil characterization; it
    may have many advantages for the determination of geotechnical factors influencing
    the behavior of soil. In this research, laboratory tests were carried out on natural
    sodic soil from the region of Ain Nouissy (Mostaganem) to investigate the geotechnical
    and chemical behavior of a natural soil using electrical resistivity measurements
    under various conditions. This study aims therefore to identify relationships
    between electrical resistivity of the soil and some physical and chemical parameters
    such as water content, porosity, salt concentration and pH. Moreover, electrical
    resistivity has been measured with the addition of salts into the natural soil.
    The results show that electrical resistivity reduced drastically with the addition
    of salt. The obtained results will be used to evaluate properties needed for soil
    characterization, as well as to track soil behavior with respect to salt concentration
    for use in soil remediation.&lt;/p&gt;'
