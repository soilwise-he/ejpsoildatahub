  title: Peculiarities of botanical composition formation of cereal agrophytocenosis
    on sodpodzolic soil depending on fertilization
  abstract: "Despite the favorable climatic conditions of the region for onion growing,\
    \ due to significant plowing of foothills (up to 80%) and low productivity, which\
    \ does not exceed 1.3 t/ha-1.5 t/ha of fodder units, they do not fully perform\
    \ their fodder production and environmental function. Ago Peculiarities of cereal\
    \ agrophytocenosis formation when growing on sod-podzolic soil of Precarpathians\
    \ depending on doses and NPK ratios of mineral fertilizers have been studied is\
    \ relevant today. Perennial cereal grass was formed from Phl\xE9um prat\xE9nse,\
    \ Lolium pratense and Bromus inermis, which is kept in agrocenosis at sufficient\
    \ level with a sprout density of 1440 pcs/m2 -2726 pcs/m2 , share of sown crops\
    \ 64%-95% and linear growth in the first moving on nitrogen-free backgrounds 31\
    \ cm-100 cm. Fertilizers had a different effect on the density and transformation\
    \ of a sown cereal grass, especially by the years of its usage. With the application\
    \ of N25 grass height increases by 1.3, and N50 by 1.7 times. In the third year\
    \ of usage, agrophytocenosis, which is formed from a mixture of cereal grasses,\
    \ is transformed into a grouping with a predominance of Bromus inermis, the share\
    \ of which increases with the nitrogen dose increase"
