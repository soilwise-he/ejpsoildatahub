  title: Grafting Tomato Cultivars for Soil Borne Disease Suppression and Plant Growth
    and Yield Improvement
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil borne fungal diseases are among the most damaging diseases
    of tomato in Tunisia. Among them, Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by Fusarium oxysporum
    f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) races 1 and 2, Fusarium Crown and Root Rot (FCRR) incited
    by F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis lycopersici, and Verticillium wilt (VW) due to
    Verticillium dahliae (Vd) races 1 and 2 are of particular concern. In the current
    study, the grafting of three scion tomato cultivars (cvs. Kawthar, Amal and Malinche)
    onto the interspecific hybrid rootstock Maxifort was evaluated for diseases management
    and plant growth and yield improvement. Under artificial inoculation conditions,
    the present study demonstrates that the plant response to the tested pathogens
    (Vd races 1 and 2, FOL races 1 and 2 and FORL) used for inoculation differed according
    to the tomato cultivars used, the grafting treatment and their interactions. Overall,
    grafting was shown to be effective in significantly reducing disease severity,
    estimated via the relative vascular discoloration extent (RVDE), by 24%, and enhancing
    root and stem fresh weights and yield by 18%, 30% and 17%, respectively, compared
    to non-grafted controls. Under natural greenhouse conditions, disease severity
    was statistically comparable on grafted and non-grafted cvs. Kawthar and Malinche,
    plants. However, grafting cv. Amal plants have significantly reduced, by 61%,
    the RVDE as compared to non-grafted ones. Root fresh weight noted on Maxifort-grafted
    cvs. Kawthar, Amal and Malinche plants was significantly enhanced by 32, 59 and
    55%, relative to non-grafted ones. Plants grafted onto Maxifort rootstock had
    produced 63% higher total yield than the non-grafted control. As assessed by comparative
    disease symptoms and plant growth and yield response, grafting tomato on the rootstock
    Maxifort have could be implemented in an integrated disease management with other
    soil disinfection methods for reducing soil borne populations in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
