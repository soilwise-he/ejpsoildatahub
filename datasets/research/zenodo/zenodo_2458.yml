  title: A Comparison between Linear and Equivalent Linear Ground Response Analysis
    of the Sub-Soil of Ganakbari, Dhaka, Bangladesh
  abstract: Site-specific dynamic response analysis is the key step to ensure site
    safety against probable seismic hazards. One-dimensional(1-D) ground response
    analysis is widely used in engineering practices to predict the dynamic response
    of a site. This paper deals with the comparison of two frequency-dependent methods
    of 1-D ground response analysis-Linear and Equivalent Linear for ground response
    analysis of the sub-soil of Ganakbari, Savar, Dhaka. SPT N values were collected
    from the literature published earlier by various researchers. Shear wave velocity
    was determined by using a universal correlation of Shear wave velocity and Standard
    Penetration Test values.[6]. Analyses were performed using DEEPSOIL software for
    both linear and equivalent linear methods. As input motion, Kobe earthquake, Kocaeli
    earthquake, Northridge earthquake, Nahanni Earthquake, and Parkfield earthquake
    was used. The Response spectrum, the Peak Ground Acceleration, maximum strain,
    maximum stress ratio, and the amplification factor was determined and represented
    in this paper from both linear and equivalent linear analysis. Linear analysis
    results were compared with those of the equivalent linear method. Differences
    were found between the site responses predictions from linear and equivalent linear
    methods though both are 1-D frequency domain-based analysis methods.
