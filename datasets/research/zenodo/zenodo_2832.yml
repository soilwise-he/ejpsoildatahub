  title: Effect of Triton X-100 and White Rot Fungus (Pleurotus ostratus) on Physico-chemical
    Composition of Crude Oil Impacted Soil
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the effect of triton x-100 and white\
    \ rot fungus (&lt;em&gt;Pleurotus ostratus&lt;/em&gt;) on physico-chemical composition\
    \ of crude oil impacted soil. Crude oil highly impacted soil excavated from an\
    \ oil spill site at Obeche community in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area\
    \ of Rivers State, Nigeria was used in this study. Remediation was induced by\
    \ biostimulation using white rot fungus (&lt;em&gt;Pleurotus\_ ostreatus&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ and treatment with a chemical surfactant (Triton x-100). The pH value of polluted\
    \ soil sample (Cell A) was high (6.81\xB1 0.52) when compared with other cells\
    \ that were amended. The result of the soil electrical conductivity shows a significant\
    \ difference (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;\u2264 0.05) when cell A is compared with\
    \ other cells. Only cell C amended with Triton x-100 had a lower value of 31.67\
    \ \xB1 1.52 when compared with cell A (polluted soil sample) (76.67 \xB1 1.52).\
    \ Cells B and D had higher values of 161.00 \xB1 2.00, and 233.67 \xB1 4.04 respectively\
    \ when compared with cell A (76.67 \xB1 1.52). Significant (p\u22640.05) increase\
    \ in the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents was observed\
    \ amended cells after the 60 days period of incubation when compared with cell\
    \ A. For PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; (mg/kg) and NO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ (mg/kg) all the cells were significantly different (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;\u2264\
    \ 0.05)\_and there was a recognized decrease in their values when compared with\
    \ the control sample (Cell A). Organic Sulphur values decreased exponentially\
    \ in all the cells amended (0.10 \xB1 0.00) when compared with the control cell\
    \ (A) (15.00 \xB1 0.00).&lt;/p&gt;"
