  title: Soil Fertility Analysis using IoT
  abstract: Soil is crucial for economic and social<br> development as it provides
    the foundation for plant growth<br> and life cycle. Agriculture heavily relies
    on resources like<br> land and fertilizer to produce food. However, the National<br>
    Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) reports that the<br> annual soil loss
    rate in India is about 15.35 tonnes per<br> hectare, which leads to the loss of
    5.37 to 8.4 million tonnes<br> of nutrients. This is due to intensive agricultural
    practices<br> that cause nutrient imbalance and soil depletion,<br> exacerbated
    by a lack of awareness about soil health. The<br> declining soil health is one
    of the reasons for stagnant or<br> decreasing crop yields, which will likely worsen
    in the<br> future.<br> To address this issue, this project aims to use IoT<br>
    technology to test different types of soil and determine their<br> macronutrient
    (NPK) and micronutrient values. The<br> measured nutrient values are compared
    to a dataset of healthy soil samples' ideal nutrient values using an easy-to-<br>
    use interface that displays pictorial representations. The farmer receives a detailed
    soil report that compares the<br> soil's micro and macro nutrient values to the
    ideal values,<br> much like a soil health report card.
