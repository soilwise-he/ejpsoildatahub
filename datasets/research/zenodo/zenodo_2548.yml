  title: Formation of A High-Quality Crop of Vegetable Soybeans with Repeated Cultivation
    On Gray-Soil Soils of Uzbekistan
  abstract: Cultivation of vegetable soybeans in re-cultivation after growing winter
    cereal crops and early vegetable crops will bring substantial profits while obtaining
    valuable high-protein products and improving soil fertility. The results of our
    studies are described and it was found that with later summer sowing periods,
    a significantly smaller number of beans is formed on one plant and their size
    decreases. With the sowing date June 20, the number of beans in the resulting
    crop was 58 pcs / plant, and the average weight of 1000 green seeds of beans was
    675 g, and with a late sowing on July 30 was, respectively, 31 pcs. /plant and
    610 g. <strong>Keywords:</strong> vegetable soybeans, repeated sowing dates, yield,
    quality of beans, economic effect,
