  title: Method of integro-differential equations for interpreting the results of
    vertical electrical sounding of the soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The paper is devoted to&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;of
    determining the geoelectric structure of the soil within the procedure of testing
    the grounding arrangements of existing power plants and substations to the required
    depth in conditions of dense development. To solve the problem, it was proposed
    to use the Schlumbergers method , which has a greater sounding depth compared
    to the Wenner electrode array.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;of
    the work is to develop a mathematical model for interpreting the results of soil
    sounding by the Schlumberger method in the form of a four-layer geoelectric structure.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;.
    To construct a mathematical model, it is proposed to use the solution of a particular
    problem about the field of a point current source, which, like the observation
    point, is located in the first layer of a four-layer soil. Based on this expressions,
    a system of linear algebraic equations of the 7-th order with respect to the unknown
    coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;was
    compiled. On the basis of its analytical solution, an expression for the potential
    of the electric field was obtained for conducting VES (the point current source
    and the observation point are located only on the soil surface).&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;.
    Comparison of the results of soil sounding by the Schlumberger installation and
    the interpretation of its results for the same points shows a sufficient degree
    of approximation: the maximum relative error does not exceed 9.7 % (for the second
    point), and the average relative error is 3.6 %.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Originality&lt;/strong&gt;.
    Based on the obtained expression, a test version of the program was implemented
    in Visual Basic for Applications to interpret the results of VES by the Schlumberger
    method. To check the obtained expressions, the interpretation of the VES results
    was carried out on the territory of a 150 kV substation of one of the mining and
    processing plants in the city of Kriviy Rih.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Practical significance.&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The
    developed mathematical model will make it possible to increase the sounding depth,
    and, consequently, the accuracy of determining the standardized parameters of
    the grounding arrangements of power stations and substations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
