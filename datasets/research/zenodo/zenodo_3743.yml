  title: 'Soil-Vegetation Relationships In Arid Rangelands (Case Study: Nodushan Rangelands
    Of Yazd, Iran)'
  abstract: 'The objective of this research was to identify the

    vegetation-soil relationships in Nodushan arid rangelands of Yazd. 5

    sites were selected for measuring the cover of plant species and soil

    attributes. Soil samples were taken in 0-10 and 10-80 cm layers. The

    species studied were Salsola tomentosa, Salsola arbuscula, Peganum

    harmala, Zygophylum eurypterum and Eurotia ceratoides. Canonical

    correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyze the data. Based

    on the CCA results, 74.9 % of vegetation-soil variation was explained

    by axis 1-3. Axis 1, 2 and 3 accounted for 27.2%, 24.9 % and 22.8%

    of variance respectively. Correlation between axis 1, 2, 3 and speciesedaphic

    variables were 0.995, 0.989, 0.981 respectively. Soil texture,

    lime, salinity and organic matter significantly influenced the

    distribution of these plant species. Determination of soil-vegetation

    relationships will be useful for managing and improving rangelands

    in arid and semi arid environments.'
