  title: Soil Needs and Drivers of Change Across Europe and Land Use Types - Booklet
  abstract: "In the following pages, the PREPSOIL project presents 20 regions\u2019\
    \ analysis and results from literature review, workshops, and interviews in the\
    \ Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework categories. The participatory\
    \ approach used for acquiring the knowledge necessary to fill the DPSIR conceptual\
    \ framework was a series of workshops and interviews which spanned all of Europe.\
    \ The workshops served as a way of validating the knowledge acquired from the\
    \ desk analysis and gathering identified gaps in knowledge More than 500 stakeholders\
    \ from farmers, policy and government, soil and other advisors, research, business,\
    \ CSOs and NGOs were interacted during the participatory research process.\_\n\
    \nRegional focused knowledge is co-generated on the existing and emerging socio-economic\
    \ and geo-biophysical perspectives that determines the health of soils as indicated\
    \ by their ability to provide ecosystem services. The emerging results were abstracted\
    \ to a level to find commonalities but also specificities. These findings will\
    \ be validated in the EU Soil Week (21-23 November, Madrid) and developed into\
    \ a synthesis report. The synthesis report\_will elaborate the findings for each\
    \ land use category.\n\nMore information about all the workshops organised in\
