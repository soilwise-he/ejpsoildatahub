  title: Assessing The Effects Of Integrated Soil Fertility Management On Biological
    Efficiency And Economic Advantages Of Intercropped Maize (Zea Mays L.) And Soybean
    (Glycine Max L.) In Dr Congo
  abstract: "Interactions among species play an important role in determining the\
    \ structure and the dynamics of plant communities. The main objectives of the\
    \ study were (i) to assess and compare different competition indices and their\
    \ relationship with yield component under different inorganic and organic fertilizers\
    \ regimes; and (ii), to identify nutrient management regimes options that lead\
    \ to high yields and incomes in a maize-soybean intercropping system. Effects\
    \ of integrated soil practices management on crop competition, yields components\
    \ and economics advantage in maize-soybean intercropping system in a savannah\
    \ region of the DR-Congo were investigated. Field trials were conducted at two\
    \ sites in a randomized complete block design with six treatments replicated four\
    \ times. Grain yield and yield components increased under integrated soil fertility\
    \ management (ISFM) (inorganic or mineral and organic fertilization combined)\
    \ than other treatments at the two sites of the study. Organic biomass application\
    \ resulted in similar grain yield production than the inorganic (mineral) fertilizer\
    \ application. The required land decreased when soil was fertilized compared to\
    \ the control. Land equivalent coefficient (LEC) values ranged from 0.50 to 0.79.\
    \ Soybean intercropped with maize resulted in an area-time equivalency ratio (ATER)\
    \ higher than 1 for all the treatments confirming the intrinsic advantage of intercropping\
    \ over sole crops. Among all the treatments, integrated nutrient management (ISFM)\
    \ resulted in higher yields and monetary advantage index (MAI) values for maize/soybean\
    \ mixture compared to other treatments. The highest MAI of 343891 was generated\
    \ by the Tithonia (organic) \u2013 inorganic applications."
