  title: Phyto-evaluation of Cd-Pb Using Tropical Plants in Soil-Leachate Conditions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Sources of soil contamination can exist in various types of
    conditions including in the form of semifluids. In this study, 3 different types
    of tropical plants, Acacia (&lt;em&gt;Acacia mangium&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;Willd), Mucuna
    (&lt;em&gt;Mucuna bracteata&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;DC. ex Kurz) and Vetiver (&lt;em&gt;Vetiveria
    zizanioides&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;L. Nash), were tested under different levels of soil-leachate
    conditions. The relative growth rate, metal tolerance, and phytoassessment of
    cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) accumulation in the roots and shoots were determined
    using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Tolerance index, translocation factor,
    metal accumulation ratio, and percentage metal efficacy were applied to assess
    the metal translocation ability among all the 3 types of plants. Significantly
    higher (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;.05) accumulation of Cd and
    Pb was exhibited in the roots and shoots of all 3 plants growing under the soil-leachate
    conditions. However, negative growth performance and plant withering were observed
    in both Acacia and Mucuna with increased application of higher soil-leachate levels.
    Vetiver accumulated remarkably higher total concentration of Cd (116.16-141.51&thinsp;mg/kg)
    and Pb (156.37-365.27&thinsp;mg/kg) compared with both Acacia and Mucuna. The
    overall accumulation trend of Cd and Pb in the 3 plants growing under the soil-leachate
    conditions was in the order of Vetiver &gt; Acacia &gt; Mucuna. The findings of
    the study suggest that Vetiver has great potential as Cd and Pb phytoremediator
    in soil-leachate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
