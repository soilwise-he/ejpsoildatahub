  title: Effect of Legume Cover Crops on Soil Moisture and Orange Root Distribution
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Inadequate rain is a major hindrance to soil moisture and crop
    root growth in arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya. A field study was conducted
    in Ganda, Vitengeni and Matuga locations within the coastal lowland region of
    Kenya from May, 2012 to April, 2015 to evaluate the effects of three leguminous
    cover crops on soil moisture retention and orange tree feeder root distribution.
    Treatments included mucuna (&lt;em&gt;Mucuna pruriens&lt;/em&gt;), cowpea (&lt;em&gt;Vigna
    unguiculata&lt;/em&gt;), dolichos (&lt;em&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/em&gt;) cover
    crops and unplowed fallow of natural vegetation as a control. The experiment was
    laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) and each treatment was replicated
    four times. Data collected were: soil particle size distribution, soil moisture
    content and orange dry root density. The data collected was subjected to analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) using procedures of R statistical analysis version 3.3.2.
    Mean separation was done using the least significant difference (LSD) value at
    5% level of significance. Results indicated that mucuna, dolichos and cowpea cover
    crops significantly (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.05) increased soil moisture content.
    The mucuna treated plots recorded an increase in SMC by 39.0% and 33%, dolichos
    increased by 34.4% and 28.9% and cowpea by 33.6% and 27.3% at soil depth 0-20
    and 20-40 cm, respectively, over their own controls. Mucuna and dolichos significantly
    (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.05) increased orange feeder root distribution. Mucuna
    treated plots supported the highest increase in orange root distribution by 36.5%
    and 31.8%, dolichos increased by 30.2% and 34.1% while cowpea increased by 18.3%
    and 18.8% in soil depth 0-20 and 20-40 cm respectively compared to their own control.
    It can be concluded that the three legumes; mucuna, cowpea and dolichos cover
    crop improved soil moisture and root distribution in orange production. The overall
    ranking was as follows: mucuna &gt; dolichos &gt; cowpea. From the finding, the
    use of mucuna and dolichos cover cropping system is recommended as a soil management
    practice aimed at improving the orange productivity. Further evaluation on the
    long term (&gt;3 years) effects of cover crops on soil moisture and orange root
    distribution under different agro ecological zones is suggested.&lt;/p&gt;'
