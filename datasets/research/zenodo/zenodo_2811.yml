  title: GROWTH AND YIELD OF CAYENNE PEPPER PLANTS (Capsicum frutescens l.) ON BOKASHI
    PLANTING MEDIA AND SOIL MIXTURE WITH BURNT HUSK
  abstract: "Cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.) is an important vegetable, especially\
    \ in tropical and subtropical areas. Bokashi is an organic fertilizer produced\
    \ by fermenting organic materials with the help of EM4. This is a mixed culture\
    \ of various types of beneficial microorganisms, namely lactic acid bacteria,\
    \ photosynthetic bacteria, Actinomycetes, Streptomycetes sp., and yeast. Bokashi\
    \ application is very useful for improving soil properties, both physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.This research aims to determine the effect of bokashi fertilizer\
    \ doses on the growth and production of cayenne pepperand determine the right\
    \ dosage for the growth and yield of cayenne pepper plants. (Capsicum frutescens\
    \ L.). This research was carried out by Sambaliung District, from February to\
    \ May 2021.The research used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with one factor,\
    \ namely the dose of bokashi fertilizer (P) with 10 replications, namely: P0 =\
    \ 0% bokashi and 100% soil mixture with burnt husks; P1 = 25% bokashi and 75%\
    \ soil mixture with burnt husks; P2 = 50% bokashi and 50% mixture of soil and\
    \ roasted husks; and P3 = 75% bokashi and 25% soil mixture with burnt husks. Data\
    \ analysis uses a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) and if there is a significant\
    \ difference then it will be continued with Duncan\u2019s Multiple Range Test\
    \ at a rate of 5%. The results showed that the doses of bokashi and roasted husks\
    \ were not significantly different when observing the number of leaves in the\
    \ first week, number of productive branches, number of fruit per plant, production,\
    \ flowering time, maturity, and fruit length. P3 treatment gave the highest results,\
    \ namely 337 g plant-1."
