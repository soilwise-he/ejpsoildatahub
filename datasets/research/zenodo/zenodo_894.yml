  title: 'Revisiting impacts of MJO on soil moisture: a causality perspective'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have documented that the Madden-Julian Oscillation
    (MJO) has impacts in extreme dry/wet conditions over tropical regions and in atmospheric
    state. They are based, however, in correlation analysis, and therefore do not
    consider non-linear interactions nor they establish cause-effect relationships.In
    this study we introduce a generalization of the non-linear Granger causality (GC)
    test to identify causal relations between MJO and hydrological extremes. The method
    is able to identify causal relations under noisy, nonlinear and non-stationary
    scenarios. A probabilistic extension is also introduced where the causal test
    operates directly on the marginal likelihood (also called evidence) of the observations,
    which is analytic. We apply our proposed method to MJO and satellite-based soil
    moisture (SM) data, and revisit the global teleconnection patterns induced by
    MJO events. Since El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a modulating factor
    that can result in abnormal SM global distributions, we also include it in the
    analysis as a potential driver of SM variability. Including ENSO allows us to
    differentiate the effect of the MJO and ENSO on the global SM anomalies and to
    learn the causal graph of their cause-effect relationships, and also the mutual
    relation between MJO and ENSO extreme events.&lt;/p&gt;'
