  title: A ssessment of Various Methods to Measure the Soil Suction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The foundation of the lightweight structures is commonly in
    unsaturated state conditions because located above the ground-water table. The
    matric suction governs the hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. Soil
    suction estimation is challenging both in the field and lab. The indirect and
    direct techniques are utilized to measure the soil suction. Several types of equipment
    utilized to measure the soil suction have been developed with innovative technology.
    However, there are constraints on reliability, suction range estimation, application,
    etc. The primary objective of this study is to review, describe the working principle,
    report limits, and benefits of various techniques utilized to measure the soil
    suction and select the cost-effective. A comparative study on direct and indirect
    technique of soil suction estimation is conducted base on recent literature, with
    a focus on suction range, procedure, type of suction, processing time, and application
    (lab/field). The apparatus utilized to measure directly or indirectly the matric
    suction found in the literature displays the highest range in the order of 1500
    kPa except for the filter paper. The thermocouple psychrometer and the transistor
    psychrometer can measure a maximal total suction of 8000 kPa. The chilled-mirror
    hygrometer can measure a maximal total suction of 30000 kPa in the laboratory.
    The filter paper technique and the chilled-mirror hygrometer are cost-effective
    techniques. However, the filter paper technique is likely the easiest and low-cost
    technique to measure the matric suction and total suction for the full range with
    extreme care in the test procedure both in the field and lab.&lt;/p&gt;'
