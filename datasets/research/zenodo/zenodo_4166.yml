  title: Determination Of Some Organochlorine Pesticide Residues In Vegetable And
    Soil Samples From Alau Dam And Gongulong Agricultural Sites, Borno State, North
    Eastern Nigeria
  abstract: "Five vegetables (spinach, lettuce, cabbage, tomato, and onion) were freshly\
    \ harvested from the Alau Dam and Gongulong agricultural areas for the determination\
    \ of some organochlorine pesticide residues (o, p-DDE, p,p\u2019-DDD, o,p\u2019\
    -DDD, p,p\u2019-DDT, \u03B1-BHC, \u03B3-BHC, metoxichlor, lindane, endosulfan\
    \ dieldrin, and aldrin.) Soil samples were also collected at different depths\
    \ for the determination of the above pesticides. Samples collection and preparation\
    \ were conducted using standard procedures. The concentrations of all the pesticides\
    \ in the soil and vegetable samples were determined using GC/MS SHIMADZU (GC-17A)\
    \ equipped with electron capture detector (ECD). The highest concentration was\
    \ that of p,p\u2019-DDD (132.4\xB113.45\xB5g/g) which was observed in the leaf\
    \ of cabbage, while the lowest concentration was that of p,p\u2019-DDT (2.34\xB5\
    g/g) was observed in the root of spinach. Similar trends were observed at the\
    \ Gongulong agricultural area, with p,p\u2019-DDD having the highest concentration\
    \ of 153.23\xB5g/g in the leaf of cabbage, while the lowest concentration was\
    \ that of p,p\u2019-DDT (12.45\xB5g/g) which was observed in the root of spinach.\
    \ \u03B1-BHC, \u03B3-BHC, Methoxychlor, and lindane were detected in all the vegetable\
    \ samples studied. The concentrations of all the pesticides in the soil samples\
    \ were observed to be higher at a depth of 21-30cm, while the lowest concentrations\
    \ were observed at a depth of 0-10cm. The concentrations of all the pesticides\
    \ in the vegetables and soil samples from the two agricultural sites were observed\
    \ to be at alarming levels, much higher than the maximum residue limits (MRLs)\
    \ and acceptable daily intake values (ADIs) .The levels of the pesticides observed\
    \ in the vegetables and soil samples investigated, are of such a magnitude that\
    \ calls for special attention and laws to regulate the use and circulation of\
    \ such chemicals. Routine monitoring of pesticide residues in these study areas\
    \ is necessary for the prevention, control and reduction of environmental pollution,\
    \ so as to minimize health risks."
