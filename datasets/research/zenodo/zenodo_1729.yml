    The disposal of chromium laden sludge from tannery industries is a real challenge
    to the geo-environmental professional due to sub-surface migration of toxic leachate
    may cause serious depletion of the soil and groundwater quality. Therefore, scientific
    disposal of sludge is very much encouraged instead of the poor practice of uncontrolled
    tripping in an unlined containment structure or any open dumping yard. In the
    present research work, the migration behavior of chromium(VI) through clayey soil
    has been examined through column test for assessing the contaminant buffering
    potential of the considered soil so that the same can be utilized as a landfill
    liner material in waste containment structures. The breakthrough curve (BTC) generated
    from column test data showed soil bed of 10 cm height became exhausted (reached
    more than 90% saturation with solute) after a period of 45 days. The slope of
    the BTC was also flat in nature. These indicate that the good Cr<sup>VI</sup>
    retention capacity of the clayey soil. Numerical modeling of Cr<sup>VI</sup> transport
    through the soil column was also performed using HYDRUS 1D solute transport software
    package. The model predicted results were found closely matching with the experimental
    BTC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.7212, RMSE = 0.4418). Thus, the HYDRUS 1D model can be
    considered as a worthy tool in optimizing the clayey soil liner thickness in chromium
    laden waste containment structures to arrest toxic leachate migration through
    sub-surface soil media and also to protect the precious groundwater from contamination.
