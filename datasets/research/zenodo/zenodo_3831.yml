  title: Study of the Effect of Organic Geopolymer for Soil Stabilization Materials
    as Main Road Subgrade
  abstract: "<em>Soil stabilization is an effort to improve soil properties, increase\
    \ soil carrying capacity and soil shear strength by mixing it with chemicals or\
    \ other additives. Stabilizing the soil aims to increase soil density, replace\
    \ inactive materials to increase cohesion and friction resistance that arises,\
    \ adding it to change soil\u2019s chemical and/or index, reduce the soil drainage,\
    \ replace bad soil so that it has technical specifications as subgrade for highway\
    \ pavement. The most commonly used and best-considered soil chemical stabilization\
    \ material for soil is cement but it has a negative impact so organic geopolymer\
    \ used instead of it. The organic geopolymer forming material derived from oil\
    \ palm shell ash and alkali activator are NaOH.</em> <em>Based on the results\
    \ of soil index properties, the initial PI soil test results was 22.92% and after\
    \ the addition of organic geopolymer become 15.70%. Soil engineering properties\
    \ test in the form of standard compaction testing, CBR laboratory and unconfined\
    \ compression test (UTC). The initial standard compaction test for the soil maximum\
    \ dry density soil was 14,00 </em><em>kN/m<sup>3</sup>, </em><em>and the optimum\
    \ water content was 29.39%, after adding organic geopolymer the weight become\
    \ </em><em>14,80 kN/m<sup>3</sup></em><em>, and optimum water content become 25.35\
    \ % (qualify). The initial CBR soil test results were 6.9%, but after the addition\
    \ of CBR organic geopolymer become 8.7% (qualify). The initial soil UCT results\
    \ were 59,87 kPa, after the addition of UCT organic geopolymer become 90,91 kPa\
    \ (qualify).</em>"
