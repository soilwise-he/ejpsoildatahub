  title: Effect Of Open Burning On Soil Carbon Stock In Sugarcane Plantation In Thailand
  abstract: Open burning of sugarcane fields is recognized to have a negative impact
    on soil by degrading its properties, especially soil organic carbon (SOC) content.
    Better understating the effect of open burning on soil carbon dynamics is crucial
    for documenting the carbon sequestration capacity of agricultural soils. In this
    study, experiments to investigate soil carbon stocks under burned and unburned
    sugarcane plantation systems in Thailand were conducted. The results showed that
    cultivation fields without open burning during 5 consecutive years enabled to
    increase the SOC content at a rate of 1.37 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>y<sup>-1</sup>. Also
    it was found that sugarcane fields burning led to about 15% reduction of the total
    carbon stock in the 0-30 cm soil layer. The overall increase in SOC under unburned
    practice is mainly due to the large input of organic material through the use
    of sugarcane residues.
