  title: Comparative approach of the fauna diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates
    in a stream on ferralitic soil and equatorial climate at 2 seasons in Cameroon
    (Central Africa)
  abstract: "In order to determine the structure of benthic macroinvertebrates fauna\
    \ in relation with some environmental factors, a study was carried out in the\
    \ Esoa river at Nkongsamba in the Littoral region of Cameroon from January 2021\
    \ to January 2022. Physico-chemical parameters were measured according to APHA\
    \ and Rodier recommendations, while benthic macroinvertebrates sampling was done\
    \ out according to the multihabitat approach at a monthly frequency. The physico-chemical\
    \ analyses revealed very good oxygenation of the water, a tendency of neutrality\
    \ for the pH (7.79\xB10.8 UC) and a low and constant temperature (22.61\xB11.83\
    \ \xB0C). The BMI count showed 3732 individuals, including 4 phyla, 6 classes,\
    \ 14 orders and 69 families and over 80 species. Besides, the class of insects,\
    \ and in particular the order of Odonata, supplanted the benthic fauna. The Esoa\
    \ 2 and Esoa 3 stations recorded the highest relative abundance of BMI (37.43%\
    \ and 36.99% respectively) with a predominance of pollutant taxa, notably the\
    \ families of Chironomidae, Physidae, Tubificidae and Lumbricidae. On the other\
    \ hand, the Esoa 1 station, with low relative abundance (25.56%), was more diversified\
    \ and dominated by polluosensitive taxa, including Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and\
    \ Trichoptera. The high values of the S\u04E7rensen similarity index (65.62%)\
    \ showed a high faunal similarity of the Esoa 2 and Esoa 3 stations. The high\
    \ values of the Shannon and Weaver diversity index (4.6 bits/ind) indicated a\
    \ high diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates reflecting the good ecological\
    \ status of the waters of the Esoa stream."
