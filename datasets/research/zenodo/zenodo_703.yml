  title: LSC-BASED APPROACH FOR RADON IN SOIL GAS MEASUREMENTS
  abstract: "Estimation of radon risk in soil gas is a preventive practice when building\
    \ safe dwellings. We propose a method for measuring of 222Rn in soil gas based\
    \ on liquid scintillation counting (LSC). A small-diameter hollow steel probe\
    \ with a sharpened lower-end tip combined with a large-volume syringe (RADON v.o.s.,\
    \ Czech Republic) is used as a soil gas sampling system. One measurement approach\
    \ includes direct soil gas counting in a special LS vial coated inside with plastic\
    \ scintillation material, MeltilexTM. Another approach is about 10 times more\
    \ sensitive. It includes a radon trap-glass bubbler filled with a 20-mL portion\
    \ of a toluene-based LS cocktail. After sampling, the LS solution is transferred\
    \ into conventional vials for LS counting. The air inside the 150-mL syringe in\
    \ both cases is blown through a vial or a bubbler. In the bubbler method, 3 portions\
    \ of the air syringe volume are blown through the bubbler to make the method more\
    \ reproducible. Rn sorption in the trap depends on the toluene and bubbler volumes,\
    \ temperature, and humidity. In both measurement approaches, modern LSC measurement\
    \ equipment with alpha/beta separation is used. The method was tested on Quantulus\
    \ 1220TM and Triathler LS spectrometers. The described measurement approaches\
    \ yielded count rates in the alpha window of 2.4 cpm for direct counting in Meltilex-coated\
    \ vials and ~24 cpm when Rn is trapped in toluene, both corresponding to a concentration\
    \ of 1 kBq m\u22123 for Rn in soil gas."
