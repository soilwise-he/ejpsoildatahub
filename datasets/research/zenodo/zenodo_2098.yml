  title: Some Soil Nutrient Composition Favouring The Growth Of Typha Grass In Kebbi
    And Katsina States, Nigeria.
  abstract: "This study was carried out by surveying all the water bodies of  two\
    \ states where Typha grass exists. Soil auger was used  to take soil samples randomly\
    \ from five different locations in both Kebbi and Katsina state. at the depths\
    \ of 0-5cm, 5\u2013 10cm, 10\u2013 15cm.Soil nutrient  was analyzed for the mineral\
    \ composition of the two States at different season and soil depths. The result\
    \ showed that, soil depth between 5-10cm has the highest percentage of nitrogen,\
    \ phosphorus, calcium and magnesium  during dry season.  The nutrient composition\
    \ of soil from the two states followed the same pattern during wet season."
