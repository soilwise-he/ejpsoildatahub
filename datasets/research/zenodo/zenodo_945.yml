  title: Afforestation impact on soil temperature in regional climate simulations
    over Europe
  abstract: "Scripts and netcdf files which correspond to outputs from ten regional\
    \ climate model simulations performed over Euro-CORDEX domain. The content of\
    \ files regard variables, such as the soil temperature, ground heat flux and soil\
    \ moisture. The analysis of these data conducted in the frame of the first phase\
    \ of Land Use Changes Across Scales (LUCAS) Flagship Pilot Study. The netcdf files\
    \ appear in the following order: <em>VariableName_ExperimentName_RCMname_Frequency_TimePeriod.nc</em>\
    \ where VariableName can be tslb(soil temperature) or grdflx(ground heat flux)\
    \ or sm(soil moisture). ExperimentName is FOREST or GRASS. Frequency denotes the\
    \ temporal frequency at which the respective fields have been time-averaged and\
    \ could be \u2018ymonmean\u2019 (mean monthly values) or \u2018yseasmean\u2019\
    \ (mean seasonal values). Time period refers to the simulation period (1986-01-01\
    \ to 2015-12-31). As for .ncl scripts, they are named according to the kind of\
    \ plot and the field which is plotted. For example, \u201Cancycle_tslb.ncl\u201D\
    \ refers to figures 3&amp;4, where we plot the annual cycles of tslb (soil temperature)\
    \ for GRASS and FOREST experiments. Further, \u201Cmap_tslb_cycle.ncl\u201D refers\
    \ to figure 2, where we map the differences in AAST (annual amplitude of soil\
    \ temperature) between FOREST and GRASS experiments."
