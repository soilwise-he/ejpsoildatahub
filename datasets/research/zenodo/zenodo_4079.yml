  title: Genetic variability of improved maize varieties (Zea mays L.) for acidic
    soil tolerance under contrasting environments in Assosa, Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maize is the second most widely grown food cereal
    crop cultivated in the world and consumed in various form of as part of diets
    of human and animals. However, its production and productivity is affected by
    biotic and abiotic stresses among which, soil acidity is the key factor. This
    field experiment was conducted to estimate the genetic variability of maize for
    yield and yield related traits, and determine the association of traits with grain
    yield at Assosa and Bambasi districts during the 2017main cropping season. The
    experiment consisted of limed and unlimed soil as main plots and 21 maize varieties
    as the sub-plots arranged in a split plot design with 3 replications. Highly significant
    (P&lt;0.01) differences were observed among maize varieties in yield and yield
    related-traits at both locations. Moderate to high genotypic coefficient variation,
    heritability and genetic advance as the percentage of mean values were observed
    for stalk biomass, ear biomass, diameter and length, and grain yield at both locations.
    Highly significant phenotypic and genotypic correlations were observed between
    thousand seed weight and number of kernels per row, thousand seed weight and ear
    diameter, and number of kernels per row. The yield was highly significant and
    positively associated with above stalk biomass, ear biomass, thousand seed weight,
    and number of kernels per row at both locations at the genotypic and phenotypic
    level. The phenotypic and genotypic correlation and path coefficient analysis
    of harvesting index, above ground biomass, ear biomass, number of ears harvested
    per plot, number of rows per ear, and ear length and these traits also showed
    a direct effect on yield. The highest yield in t/ha was obtained from variety
    BH547 (3.04) and (7.35) at Assosa and Bambasi, respectively. Additionally, higher
    yield was recorded from SPRH1, BH661 and BH546 varieties at both locations. Therefore,
    farmers could use the above varieties in the acidic soil until other advanced
    varieties are developed, but the exact significant impact and duration of lime
    management in the acidic soil for maize needs further investigations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
