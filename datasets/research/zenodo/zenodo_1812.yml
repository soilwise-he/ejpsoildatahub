  title: Modification in Index and Swelling-Shrinkage Characteristics of Stone Mine
    Dust Blended Expansive Soil
  abstract: The industrialization production rate increases the disposal demand of
    waste materials. The land disposal method for disposing the waste materials is
    one of the conventional methods requires a large area of land, but now a days
    due to lack of land availability these waste materials used as a soil stabilizing
    agent in soil stabilization technique. Numerous studies advocated the recycling
    potential of various industrial waste materials such as stone quarry dust; rice
    husk; coal combustion residuals; furnace slags; foundry, glass, tiles &amp; ceramics
    waste etc. as a construction material in civil engineering. Due to presence of
    Montmorillonite as a clay mineral, the expansive soil is a main problematic soil
    in the history of soil mechanics, which basically causes the alternative swelling-shrinkage
    in soil at a large extent. This nature of soil reduces the life cycle of structure
    founded on them. In this paper, the reduction of this problematic nature of soil
    by blending of stone quarry waste material such as kota stone slurry has been
    attempted. It is revealed from this experimental study, that these waste materials
    blended with soil with optimum percentage resulted in a significant improvement
    in the various properties of problematic expansive soil such as Swelling, Compaction,
    Strength and Morphological properties etc. Also, it was summarized from study
    that, the composite material is sustainable and economical viable.
