  title: Isolation, Screening and optimization of lipase producing Staphylococcus
    spp. from oil mill soil
  abstract: "Lipases involve an unmistakable spot as biocatalysts and have an expansive\
    \ range of biotechnological applications. The security of these proteins in natural\
    \ solvents has driven them into outskirts regions of natural combination prompting\
    \ the planning of novel medications, surfactants, bio responsive mixes, and oleochemicals..\
    \ In the present study, bacterial cultures were isolated from various sources\
    \ of which 8 were found to be positive for lipase production. All these 8 isolates\
    \ were screened by their zone of hydrolysis observed on the Tributyrin agar plate.\
    \ The strain showing the maximum zone of hydrolysis on the tributyrin agar plate\
    \ was identified by morphological and biochemical characters as <em>Staphylococcus\
    \ </em>spp. The 5% inoculums size for production, groundnut oil cake as substrates,\
    \ greatest lipase creation was noticed at 48 hours of growth, pH 8 was notice\
    \ to be an ideal pH, maximum growth at 37\xB0C temperature, Fermentation in shake\
    \ flask improved the lipase yield, moisture found of 80% was ideal for growth.\
    \ Results presented in this study indicate that the <em>Staphylococcus spp</em>.\
    \ isolated from our present study may be abused as a potential producer for industrial\
    \ production of lipase."
