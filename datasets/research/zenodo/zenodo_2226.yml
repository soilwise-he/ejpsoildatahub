  title: HERMITE NUMERICAL METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE RADON AND RADIUM EFFECTS OF THE
    SOIL IN BARTELLA REGION
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The Hermite numerical interpolation method used to estimate\
    \ and predict the radon and radium concentrations, from some of the experimental\
    \ measurements made on the soil samples of the Bartella region in Iraq. The results\
    \ obtained from deductible mathematical method were close to real experimental\
    \ results. Predicted results are in the range of 80.04&ndash;4051.59 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;radon\
    \ concentrations and 0.322&ndash;17.276 Bq/Kgradium concentrations corresponding\
    \ to 200-10000 tracks of alpha particles. The maximum errors were less than 0.289\
    \ and 1.172 percent for radon and radium concentrations, respectively. The effects\
    \ of radium and radon radiations estimated of soil in the studied area depend\
    \ on its concentrations, a higher number of alpha particle tracks mean high radiation\
    \ concentration, the high radiation will cause human health damage. The values\
    \ are below 370 Bq/Kg the recommended radium concentration permissible values,\
    \ by the Organization \u0430\u0449\u043A Economic Cooperation and Development\
    \ (OECD), the studied area is safe from hazards on health of radium and radon\
    \ exposure from the soil&lt;/p&gt;"
