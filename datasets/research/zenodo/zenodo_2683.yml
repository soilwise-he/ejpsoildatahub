  title: 'Drip Irrigation Soil-Adapted Sector Design and Optimal Location of Moisture
    Sensors: A Case Study in a Vineyard Plot'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;To optimise sector design in drip irrigation systems, a two-stage
    procedure is presented and applied in a commercial vineyard plot. Soil apparent
    electrical conductivity (ECa) mapping and soil purposive sampling are the two
    stages on which the proposal is based. Briefly, ECa data to wet bulb depth provided
    by the VERIS 3100 soil sensor were mapped before planting using block ordinary
    kriging. Looking for simplicity and practicality, only two ECa classes were delineated
    from the ECa map (k-means algorithm) to delimit two potential soil classes within
    the plot with possible different properties in terms of potential soil water content
    and/or soil water regime. Contrasting the difference between ECa classes (through
    discriminant analysis of soil properties at different systematic sampling locations),
    irrigation sectors were then designed in size and shape to match the previous
    soil zoning. Taking advantage of the points used for soil sampling, two of these
    locations were finally selected as candidates to install moisture sensors according
    to the purposive soil sampling theory. As these two spatial points are expectedly
    the most representative of each soil class, moisture information in these areas
    can be taken as a basis for better decision-making for vineyard irrigation management.
