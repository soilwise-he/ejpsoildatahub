  title: Effects of pesticide residues in soil substrates on the biology cycle of
    Aedes aegypti from three different setting zones in Benin
  abstract: "In order to evaluate the effects of insecticides residues in soil substrates\
    \ on the biology cycle of Aedes aegypti, we conducted a study in three ecological\
    \ zones: urban areas (Dandji, southern Benin with few agriculture activities),\
    \ peri urban areas (Awaya, central of Benin with agriculture practices), and forests\
    \ (Kaoura, northern Benin with few agriculture activities). These areas were chosen\
    \ because they provided an ideal environment for the development of Aedes aegypti.\
    \ The purpose of this study is to look for insecticide residues that may have\
    \ detrimental impacts on the biology cycle of A. aegypti. Indirect bioassays were\
    \ used to investigate the factors affecting mosquito larvae's ability to develop\
    \ normally at breeding sites, their rate of growth, and their ability to produce\
    \ an adequate number of larvae. Due to the absence of an HPLC equipment for the\
    \ direct detection of pesticide residues in samples, A. aegypti larvae at breeding\
    \ sites were reconstituted using water and soil samples obtained at each study\
    \ site. A comparison of the larval growth in test breeding locations was made\
    \ using the reference strain SBE as a control. The different bioassays demonstrate\
    \ the existence of inhibitory elements on test materials. In control samples,\
    \ larval development was observed to be normal. However, when the breeding sites\
    \ were established with just a few grams of soil samples from the three study\
    \ sites, it was found that the A. aegypti eggs had a poor hatching rate, along\
    \ with sluggish larval development and a low production of adult mosquitoes from\
    \ hatched eggs. The findings of this study indicate that toxic substances that\
    \ prevent A. aegypti eggs from hatching and larvae from growing are most likely\
    \ leftover pesticides from agricultural operations. In order to quantify the toxic\
    \ factors likely to affect the biology parameters of A. aegypti cited above, these\
    \ results must be validated using HPLC techniques.\npublished by the \_Journal\
