  title: An Overview of Soil-Pile Interaction in Liquefying Soils under Earthquake
    Condition
  abstract: Piles are of enormous structural and geotechnical importance as they help
    to transfer heavy superstructural loads to the geological formation that carries
    the superstructure. Piles are used in bridges, high-rise<br> structures and other
    structures of importance. However, in seismic zones, piles in liquefiable soils
    are susceptible<br> to failure during earthquake events despite that the current
    codes of practice provides for the design of piles against<br> seismic effect.
    This study summarizes the current knowledge of the soil-pile-structure interaction,
    and behaviour<br> in liquefiable soils subjected to earthquake loadings; and investigates
    the failure mechanisms of seismic piles<br> despite that codes of practice covers
    seismic design of piles; and goes further in suggesting design approaches that<br>
    allow for a conservative design of seismic piles.<br>
