  title: DETERMINATION OF SOME HEAVY METALS POLLUTANTS IN SOIL SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM
    ATBARA CITY-SUDAN.
  abstract: The present study was conducted to evaluate the pollution level by some
    heavy metals in four sites at Atbara city, Sudan, include Atbara Railway Station
    (ARS), Atbara Railway Workshop (ARW), Atbara Industrial Area (AIA) and Eldaman
    Complex Foundry (ECF). Soil samples were collected from the study areas and from
    area which is expected to be free from industrial emissionto serve as control.Samples
    were analyzed for heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and V) by using x-ray
    Fluorescence. The data were treated statistically by correlation coefficient and
    multivariate analysis such as cluster analysis.The results indicated that the
    mean concentration of these metals in all areas of the study were higher than
    in the control area except Fe,this refer to anthropogenic activities for all areas.
    Also the results showed that metals (Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, V,Mn and Cu) were derived
    from anthropogenic sources, (V, Mn and Cu) as originating from mixed (anthropogenic
    and natural) sources and Fe from natural source.
