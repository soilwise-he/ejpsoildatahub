  title: 'Soil ecotoxicology: state of the art and future directions'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Developments in soil ecotoxicology started with observations
    on pesticide effects on soil invertebrates in the 1960s. To support the risk assessment
    of chemicals, in the 1980s and 1990s development of toxicity tests was the main
    issue, including single species tests and also more realistic test systems like
    model ecosystems and field tests focusing on structural and functional endpoints.
    In the mean time, awareness grew about issues like bioavailability and routes
    of exposure, while biochemical endpoints (biomarkers) were proposed as sensitive
    and potential early-warning tools. In recent years, interactions between different
    chemicals (mixture toxicity) and between chemical and other stressors attracted
    scientific interest. With the development of molecular biology, omics tools are
    gaining increasing interest, while the ecological relevance of exposure and effects
    is translating into concepts like (chemical) stress ecology, ecological vulnerability
    and trait-based approaches. This contribution addresses historical developments
    and focuses on current issues in soil ecotoxicology. It is concluded that soil
    ecotoxicological risk assessment would benefit from extending the available battery
    of toxicity tests by including e.g. isopods, by paying more attention to exposure,
    bioavailability and toxicokinetics, and by developing more insight into the ecology
    of soil organisms to support better understanding of exposure and long-term consequences
    of chemical exposure at the individual, population and community level. Ecotoxicogenomics
    tools may also be helpful in this, but will require considerable further research
    before they can be applied in the practice of soil ecotoxicological risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;'
