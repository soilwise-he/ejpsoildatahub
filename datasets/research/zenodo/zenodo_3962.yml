  title: Soil Texture effect on Growth of Cowpea Plants under Root-knot Nematode,
    Meloidogyne incognita Infested Conditions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Root-knot nematode (&lt;em&gt;M. incognita&lt;/em&gt;) constitutes
    one of the important nematode pests on cowpea (&lt;em&gt;Vigna unguiculata&lt;/em&gt;).
    The edaphic factors of soil such as soil texture play vital role in determining
    the severity of diseases caused by plant-parasitic nematodes.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Screen house studies were conducted in 2013 and 2014 using 15cm size
    plastic pots (one kg capacity) having soils of five different textures (clay,
    clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand and sand) on root-knot nematode (&lt;em&gt;M.
    incognita&lt;/em&gt;) at &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;one J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/g
    soil in cowpea (c.v. Ife brown) was undertaken. Under each soil type, nematode
    inoculated and non-inoculated checks were kept. The observations recorded 60 days
    after nematode inoculation revealed that maximum and significantly higher shoot
    length, fresh and dry root and shoot weight, number of leaves and buds/plant were
    in sandy loam soil while these growth parameters were minimum and significantly
    lower in clay loam soil irrespective of nematization.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The reproduction factor of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;M. incognita&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;based
    upon galling, fecundity and final soil populations was maximum (30.6) in sandy
    soil followed by loamy soil (25.8) while it was minimum (3.5) in clay soil making
    it least favourable for the nematode. With this result it shows that Sandy soil
    is highly favourable to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;M. incognita&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;reproduction
    which is followed by loamy soil and the least favourable was clay soil to the
    nematode reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;'
