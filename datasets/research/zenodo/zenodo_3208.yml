  title: Impact of the chemical properties of different soil units on the dynamics
    of vegetal biodiversity in the Benoue National Park and its Western and Northern
    peripheries
  abstract: "This work aims at determining the impact of soils' chemical properties\
    \ on the dynamics of biodiversity in the Benoue National Park (BNP) of Cameroon\
    \ and its peripheries (surrounding hunting concessions N \xB0 1, 4, 5 and 7).\
    \ Nine, out of the sixteen soil units encountered in the BNP were studied, because\
    \ of their accessibility. On each of these nine soil units studied, three elementary\
    \ plots were materialized for the collection of soil samples and for the study\
    \ of vegetation dynamics. The chemical parameters were evaluated according to\
    \ appropriate methods and the dynamics of the vegetation was obtained by carrying\
    \ out a floristic inventory. Heterogeneity was observed in the chemical parameters\
    \ of the different soil units. Soil units S5 and S6 are the most damaged regarding\
    \ their low organic matter content (0.95 \xB1 0.78%) and (1.02 \xB1 0.33%), their\
    \ carbon (5.53 \xB1 4.54 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) and (5.91 \xB1 1.93 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ and nitrogen (1.20 \xB1 0.45 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) and (1.89 \xB1 0.41 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ contents and a very low C/N ratio (4.72 \xB1 3.96) and (3.29 \xB1 1.37) respectively.\
    \ These soils also have a low floristic abundance S5 (22 \xB1 0.53 individuals)\
    \ and S6 (8 \xB1 1.86 individuals) unlike S4 which has good chemical properties,\
    \ according to its OM (5.60 \xB1 0.83 %) and carbon (32.49 \xB1 4.79 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ content, and C/N ratio (22.38 \xB1 6.84). Consequently, its floristic abundance\
    \ (75 \xB1 1.37 individuals) and diversity (18.42 %) are considerable. These results\
    \ show that the degree of chemical degradation varies according to soils. Elsewhere\
    \ chemical properties of the soil influence the dynamics and sustainability of\
    \ the biodiversity."
