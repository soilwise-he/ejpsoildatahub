  title: INFLUENCE OF QUALITY INDICATORS OF SOIL FERTILITY ON PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
  abstract: As a result of filtration, when moisture in the soil is replaced by fluids
    with rheological parameters different from pure water, a full evaluation of the
    task requires other approaches. It represents both the geometry of the labyrinth
    system and the non-Newtonian nature of the ground body. Therefore, taking into
    account the non-Newtonian nature of fluids, in the paper, the calculation dependences
    of water permeability, initial gradient filtration coefficient, leakage coefficient
    in connection with rheology have been obtained. The limits of the application
    of the reporting relationships and the influence of the hydraulic resistance of
    the soil structure on the irrigation regime are clarified.
