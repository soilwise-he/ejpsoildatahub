  title: Long-Term Irrigation With Dairy Factory Wastewater Influences Soil Quality
  abstract: 'The effects of irrigation with dairy factory wastewater

    on soil properties were investigated at two sites that had received

    irrigation for &gt; 60 years. Two adjoining paired sites that had never

    received DFE were also sampled as well as another seven fields from

    a wider area around the factory. In comparison with paired sites that

    had not received effluent, long-term wastewater irrigation resulted in

    an increase in pH, EC, extractable P, exchangeable Na and K and

    ESP. These changes were related to the use of phosphoric acid,

    NaOH and KOH as cleaning agents in the factory. Soil organic C

    content was unaffected by DFE irrigation but the size (microbial

    biomass C and N) and activity (basal respiration) of the soil

    microbial community were increased. These increases were

    attributed to regular inputs of soluble C (e.g. lactose) present as milk

    residues in the wastewater. Principal component analysis (PCA) of

    the soils data from all 11sites confirmed that the main effects of DFE

    irrigation were an increase in exchangeable Na, extractable P and

    microbial biomass C, an accumulation of soluble salts and a liming

    effect. PCA analysis of soil bacterial community structure, using

    PCR-DGGE of 16S rDNA fragments, generally separated individual

    sites from one another but did not group them according to irrigation

    history. Thus, whilst the size and activity of the soil microbial

    community were increased, the structure and diversity of the

    bacterial community remained unaffected.'
