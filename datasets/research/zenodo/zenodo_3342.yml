  title: Soil Stabilization Using Rock Dust And Sludge
  abstract: The combined effects of two wastes Sludge and Rock dust on, compaction
    characteristics, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), Shear strength parameters and
    Swelling pressure of an expansive soil have been discussed in this project. The
    effect of molding water content on CBR of Sludge-Rock Dust stabilized expansive
    soil and the economy of Sludge and Rock dust stabilization has also been discussed
