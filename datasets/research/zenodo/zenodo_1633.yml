  title: Leaching of Heavy Metals from Contaminated Soil Stabilised by Portland Cement
    and Slag Bremen
  abstract: 'Leaching behaviour is an important evidence of soil quality. The assessment
    of leaching of heavy metals from the contaminated soil is vital for environmental
    applications. However, leaching may differ in soil stabilised by various ratios
    of binders. In this study we measured leaching behaviour of soil contaminated
    by As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn, methyl Hg, aliphatic compounds of hydrocarbons,
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
    dissolved organic carbon (DOC). To evaluate leaching of these substances we tested
    the effects of changed amount of binder (120 kg and 150 kg) and binder ratios
    (70/30 %, 50/50 % and 30/70 %) added to soil samples. Soil was dredged from several
    stations in Ostrand area, SCA Sundsvall Ortvikens Pappersbruk. The results demonstrated
    a systematically decreasing leaching with the increased slag. The contribution
    of this research include: (i) devising systematic approach to extract information
    on leaching from stabilised soil collected from the coastal area of Bothnian Bay,
    (ii) developing a workflow for stabilising soils by various combination of Portland
    cement Basement CEM II/A-V (SS EN 197-1) and ground granulated blast furnace slag
    (GGBFS), Bremen type (SS EN 15167-1), (iii) determining water ratio and density
    for the untreated and stabilised soil and performing comparative analysis, (iv)
    evaluating chemical content of pollutants and toxic elements in the aggregated
    soil samples. Treatment of the contaminated soil by binders improved its parameters
    by the increased strength and decreased leaching of heavy metals and toxic elements.'
