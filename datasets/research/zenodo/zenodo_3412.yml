  title: Erodibility Indices under Different Land Uses of Okaba Soil
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nThe study of erodibility characteristics of Okaba soil was\
    \ carried on forested, cultivated and residential land uses. Soil samples were\
    \ collected at a depth of 0 \u2013 20cm from the three different land uses identified\
    \ on topographic map of the area using soil auger. The samples were preserved\
    \ to the laboratory and analyzed for Particle-Size by hydrometer method. Standard\
    \ Laboratory procedures described by ASTM D 422 were performed for erodobility\
    \ indices. Values of modified clay ratio (MCR), clay ratio (CR), dispersion ratio\
    \ (DR), and erosion ratio (ER) were observed to be the highest at Ogane, whereas,\
    \ water stable aggregates (WSA) were highest at Okaba Town location. Among different\
    \ land uses these indices were in the order of cultivated > forest > residential\
    \ but, the value for ER were equal at Forested and residential land uses. However,\
    \ WSA followed the opposite trend. Soil loss and the erodibility indices were\
    \ statistically correlated. Highly positive correlation of MCR and CR (R2 = 0.992\
    \ and 0.889 respectively) were experienced with soil loss except for WSA index\
    \ where the value was negative (0.021). DR and ER has weak correlation coefficient\
    \ (R2 = 0.374 and 0.227 respectively). MCR and CR were observed to be better indices\
    \ of soil erodibility in the study area these correlations were significant at\
    \ 1% level of significance for MCR and CR, DR, ER and WSA."
