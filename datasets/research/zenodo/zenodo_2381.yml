  title: Rapid assessment of As and other elements in naturally-contaminated calcareous
    soil through hyperspectral VIS-NIR analysis
  abstract: Although arsenic (As) toxicity in soil vary depending on its chemical
    forms and oxidation states, regulatory limits for this compartment rely on total
    As content. Conventional methods of total As determination are expensive and time-consuming.
    The development of predictive techniques might enable a speditive assessment of
    As contamination in those scenarios, such as thermal spring sites, where exposure
    to the metalloid poses a threat to human health. The objective of this study was
    to assess the suitability of Visible Near Infrared spectrophotometry for predicting
    the total As content in highly calcareous thermal spring soils and the same aim
    was pursued for those elements (i.e. Al, Fe and Mn) the chemistry of which is
    tightly connected with that of As. A Partial Least Square approach, including
    cross-validation and external independent test, was used to relate the concentrations
    of the target elements to spectral data. The most accurate prediction was found
    for As with Pearson's coefficient, RMSE, RPD and SEP being equal to 0.94, 69.65,
    2.9 and 66.99, respectively. Less accurate predictions were found for Al (r=0.88;
    RMSE=11014; RPD=1.96; SEP=11014), Fe (r=0.93; RMSE=6921.1; RPD=2.45; SEP=6462.4),
    and Mn (r=0.92; RMSE=542.01; RPD=2.43; SEP=529.79). Pallottino, F., Stazi, S.R.,
