  title: Impacts of Coal Mine Water and Damodar River Water Irrigation on Soil and
    Maize (Zea mays L.) in a Coalfield Area of Damodar Valley, India
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The present investigation was carried out to assess the environmental
    and biochemical impacts due to irrigation of coal mine water and Damodar River
    water on Kharif crop, maize (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;L.) in a coalfield
    area of Damodar Valley, India. Coal mine water and Damodar River water samples
    were collected for the monitoring of its quality from a coalfield area of Damodar
    Valley. The samples were analyzed for various parameters and compared with prescribed
    standard, which revealed that the total suspended solids of coal mine water were
    higher as Damodar River water. A pot experiment with&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z. mays&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;was
    conducted to study the suitability of this coal mine water for irrigation. The
    plants of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z. mays&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in the pots were irrigated with
    coal mine water and Damodar River water in two concentrations (100% and 50% dilution
    with double distilled water) and pure double distilled water was used for control.
    There was 100% germination of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z. mays&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in all the
    treatments. The plant growth, chlorophyll content of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z. mays&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and
    soil quality parameters were significantly better in coal mine water and Damodar
    River water treated pots. However, the Damodar River water and coal mine water
    could be successfully used for irrigation. In general, coal mine water and Damodar
    River water can be used after mixing with good quality of water has shown better
    growth of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z. mays&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'
