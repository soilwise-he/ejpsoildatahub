    2016, accepted 02 October 2016</em> This research uses data from heavy metal soil
    monitoring collected in 23 countries and cities across Taiwan by the Environmental
    Protection Administration (EPA), Taiwan. Multivariate statistical analysis methods
    are applied to investigate the relationships among the variables of the eight
    major heavy metals, hoping to find the principal factors that affect soil contamination
    and the contamination tendency in Taiwan. The discussion of relationships among
    the eight heavy metals (i.e. chromium (Cr), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), Zn (zinc),
    Hg (mercury), Cd (cadmium), As (arsenic), and Pb (lead)) can reflect the difference
    in the contaminations in affected areas and contamination level assessment models.
    The results of the factor analysis show that the principal factors affecting the
    contamination mechanism of the eight heavy metals can be simplified into two :
    (1) Highly oxidizing pollutants comprised of Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn. The loading capacity
    order from high to low is Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, which corresponds to several rules
    on the periodic table. (2) The semiconductor potential pollutant factor comprised
    of Cd, As, and Pb. The factors, either the transition metal Cd or the typical
    elements, As and Pb, all have something to do with the formation of a compound
    semiconductor. The major mechanism for semiconductor formation is the metallic
    bond. As for the cluster analysis, five clusters are first divided according to
    the contamination characteristics. Discriminant analysis is used to classify the
    type of a new sample with an accuracy as high as 96.87%. This means that the clustering
    for the cluster analysis is acceptable. The research findings can serve as reference
    material for relevant entities in the planning and application of soil remediation
    strategies.'
