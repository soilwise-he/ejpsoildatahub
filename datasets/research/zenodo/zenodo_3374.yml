  title: Influence Fly Ash On Chemically Stabilized Cohesive Soil
  abstract: 'Clayey soils exhibit antagonistic characteristics such as low strength,
    swelling and shrinkage etc. In order to improve the engineering properties the
    common method pursued is stabilization. In the present project, experimentation
    is carried out to investigate the influence of additives such as Fly ash and Potassium
    Chloride on Compressive strength, California Bearing Ratio of the clayey soil.
    The two additives are added and the tests are carried out by keeping the proportions
    of Fly ash and Potassium Chloride as constant (30% and 1%). The Index properties
    are analysed for control sample and also with constant proportions of KCl (1 %),
    fly ash (30%) and combination of KCl and Fly ash (30% and 1%). The results show
    substantial improvement in CBR value, Compressive strength and the Shear strength
    of composite containing Fly ash, Potassium Chloride (30% : 1%).  Hence the inclusion
    of Fly ash and Potassium Chloride can be effectively used for pavement sub-grade
    strength improvements.'
