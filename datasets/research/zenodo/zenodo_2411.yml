  title: Response of Sweet Corn Growth to Soil Fertilization with Sulfur, NPK Levels
    and Spraying of Ascorbic Acid
  abstract: The experiment was carried out in Abu Gharaq area, 10 km west of Hilla
    city, Iraq during the autumn season of 2018 in silt clay soil to study the effect
    of foam sulfur addition (0 and 20 Kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>), NPK fertilizer (20:20:20)
    at levels of 0, 75 and 150 Kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>, ascorbic acid spraying at concentrations
    of (0, 25 and 50 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>) and their interactions on growth of sweet
    corn. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used. The
    results showed that the addition of (20 Kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>) foam sulfur caused
    a significant increase in plant height (125.9 cm), plant leaf number (12.19),
    plant leaf area (4206 cm<sup>2</sup>), chlorophyll (60.4 SPAD), leaf content of
    N, P and K (15.49, 2.854 and 19.66 mg.g<sup>-1</sup>) respectively. Increasing
    the level of NPK up to (150 Kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>) significantly caused an increase
    in plant height (126.8 cm), plant leaf number (12.06), plant leaf area (4258 cm<sup>2</sup>),
    chlorophyll (61.7 SPAD), leaf content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (15.63,
    2.88 and 19.96 mg.g<sup>-1</sup>) respectively. Spraying ascorbic acid up to (50
    mg.L<sup>-1</sup>) significantly increased plant leaf area (4208), and chlorophyll
    leaf content (59.2). The interactions between the factors caused a significant
    effect on most traits.
