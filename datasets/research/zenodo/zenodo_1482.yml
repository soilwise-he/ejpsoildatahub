  title: 'Crude oil degradation in loamy soil using Neem root extracts: An experimental
    study'
  abstract: The biodegradability of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) in loamy soil
    amended using neem root extracts was investigated in this study. The neem roots
    were soaked separately into predetermined volume of water to extract liquids from
    the roots. The solution of neem-water and extract was then used as treatment to
    remediate crude oil polluted loamy soil. The loamy soil was used for this study.
    The physicochemical properties of the loamy soil before pollution, after pollution
    and at the 84<sup>th</sup> day of treatment were determined, while analysis for
    the total bacteria count and TPH were carried out for 84<sup>th</sup> days at
    14 days interval. Density, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture content (MC),
    total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (P) in the soils
    increased after pollution, except for pH, which was the opposite. However, density,
    EC, MC, TOC, TN and P decreased remarkably with time under treatment, while pH
    increased from acidity to neutrality after the treatments. The total bacteria
    count increased across the soils with treatments up to the 56th day of analysis,
    but declined gradually thereafter due to depletion of the nutrients in the loamy
    soil. The degradation of TPH in the loamy soil decreased across the process, but
    higher in the loamy soil with treatment. However, TPH removal was higher with
    treatment in water solution with performed of neem extract. The TPH degradation
    percentage at the 84<sup>th</sup> day was determined and the response thus observed
    was promising for the degradation of pollutant in soil.
