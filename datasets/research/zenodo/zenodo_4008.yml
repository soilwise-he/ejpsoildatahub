  title: Application The Statistical Conditional Entropy Function For Definition Of
    Cause-And-Effect Relations During Primary Soil Formation
  abstract: 'Within the framework of a method of the information

    theory it is offered statistics and probabilistic model for definition of

    cause-and-effect relations in the coupled multicomponent

    subsystems. The quantitative parameter which is defined through

    conditional and unconditional entropy functions is introduced. The

    method is applied to the analysis of the experimental data on

    dynamics of change of the chemical elements composition of plants

    organs (roots, reproductive organs, leafs and stems). Experiment is

    directed on studying of temporal processes of primary soil formation

    and their connection with redistribution dynamics of chemical

    elements in plant organs. This statistics and probabilistic model

    allows also quantitatively and unambiguously to specify the

    directions of the information streams on plant organs.'
