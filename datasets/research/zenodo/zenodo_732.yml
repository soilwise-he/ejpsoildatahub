  title: Testing graphene versus classical soil improvers in a sandy calcisol
  abstract: "In this study for the first time, Graphene was tested in a leaching batch\
    \ experiment on a calcareous sandy soil (Calcisol) to assess its capacity to ameliorate\
    \ soil's properties in comparison with traditional soil improvers (Compost, Biochar,\
    \ and Zeolites). A first set of experiments was performed in triplicates using\
    \ the saturation soil extraction method (5:1 liquid\u2013solid ratio) with deionized\
    \ water as liquid phase and two different rates (minimum and maximum) of each\
    \ improver. A second set of experiments (5:1 liquid\u2013solid ratio) was performed\
    \ to understand the fate of fertilizers, using the maximum amount of soil improvers\
    \ and two different liquid phases: NPK solution from a synthetic fertilizer and\
    \ fertigation water from a wastewater treatment plant. EC, pH, ORP and dissolved\
    \ O<sub>2</sub> were monitored daily for two weeks, and water samples were obtained\
    \ at the end of the experiment to analyze DOC, major ions, and trace elements.\
    \ Results showed that Graphene neither altered the physical\u2013chemical parameters\
    \ nor released nutrients and heavy metals in the solution in comparison to control\
    \ and other improvers. Biochar increased EC and pH beyond recommended limits for\
    \ some plants growth, while Compost released NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> above\
    \ threshold limits. Batches with the NPK solution showed NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>\
    \ accumulation in the solute for controls, and to a less extent for Zeolites,\
    \ Graphene and Biochar, while no accumulation was recorded for Compost. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>\
    \ accumulation was triggered by microbial N remineralization in absence of a C\
    \ source. Batches with fertigation water showed NO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2013</sup>\
    \ accumulation in the solute due to incomplete nitrification in all the improvers\
    \ and control batches, since the available C source consumed O<sub>2</sub> that\
    \ in turn hampered the nitrification process. Despite the above-mentioned limitations,\
    \ Graphene performed well in comparison to the other soil improvers in reducing\
    \ nutrients and metals leaching."
