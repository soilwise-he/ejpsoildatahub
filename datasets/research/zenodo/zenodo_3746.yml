  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The article examines the issues of the possibility of studying
    the areas of development by soil erosion and its control. The study proved that
    the development of soil erosion is based on the forming impact of natural and
    anthropogenic factors. The degree of potential danger and the possibility of prevention,
    taking into account, the preservation of the environmental situation in the foothills
    of the Upper Shirvan in the example of the Shamakhi district of the Republic of
    Azerbaijan, were studied. The main tasks of the study were a determination of
    the amount and degree of development of eroded and erosion-prone soils of the
    foothill zones carried out on the basis of soil erosion surveys of the farms of
    the republic&lt;/p&gt;'
