  title: Effect Of Fines On Liquefaction Susceptibility Of Sandy Soil
  abstract: Investigation of liquefaction susceptibility of materials that have been
    used in embankments, slopes, dams, and foundations is very essential. Many catastrophic
    geo-hazards such as flow slides, declination of foundations, and damage to earth
    structure are associated with static liquefaction that may occur during abrupt
    shearing of these materials. Many artificial backfill materials are mixtures of
    sand with fines and other composition. In order to provide some clarifications
    and evaluations on the role of fines in static liquefaction behaviour of sand
    sandy soils, the effect of fines on the liquefaction susceptibility of sand was
    experimentally examined in the present work over a range of fines content, relative
    density, and initial confining pressure. The results of an experimental study
    on various sand-fines mixtures are presented. Undrained static triaxial compression
    tests were conducted on saturated Perth sand containing 5% bentonite at three
    different relative densities (10, 50, and 90%), and saturated Perth sand containing
    both 5% bentonite and slag (2%, 4%, and 6%) at single relative density 10%. Undrained
    static triaxial tests were performed at three different initial confining pressures
    (100, 150, and 200 kPa). The brittleness index was used to quantify the liquefaction
    potential of sand-bentonite-slag mixtures. The results demonstrated that the liquefaction
    susceptibility of sand-5% bentonite mixture was more than liquefaction susceptibility
    of clean sandy soil. However, liquefaction potential decreased when both of two
    fines (bentonite and slag) were used. Liquefaction susceptibility of all mixtures
    decreased with increasing relative density and initial confining pressure.
