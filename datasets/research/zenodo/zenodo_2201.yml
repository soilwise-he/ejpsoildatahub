  title: A Review on the Importance of Microbial Biopolymers Such as Xanthan Gum to
    Improve Soil Properties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Chemical stabilization of soils is one of the most used techniques
    to improve the properties of weak soils in order to allow their use in geotechnical
    works. Although several binders can be used for this purpose, Portland cement
    is still the most used binder (alone or combined with others) to stabilize soils.
    However, the use of Portland cement is associated with many environmental problems,
    so microbiological-based approaches have been explored to replace conventional
    methods of soil stabilization as sustainable alternatives. Thus, the use of biopolymers,
    produced by microorganisms, has emerged as a technical alternative for soil improvement,
    mainly due to soil pore-filling, which is called the bioclogging method. Many
    studies have been carried out in the last few years to investigate the suitability
    and efficiency of the soil&ndash;biopolymer interaction and consequent properties
    relevant to geotechnical engineering. This paper reviews some of the recent applications
    of the xanthan gum biopolymer to evaluate its viability and potential to improve
    soil properties. In fact, recent results have shown that the use of xanthan gum
    in soil treatment induces the partial filling of the soil voids and the generation
    of additional links between the soil particles, which decreases the permeability
    coefficient and increases the mechanical properties of the soil. Moreover, the
    biopolymer&rsquo;s economic viability was also analyzed in comparison to cement,
    and studies have demonstrated that xanthan gum has a strong potential, both from
    a technical and economical point of view, to be applied as a soil treatment.&lt;/p&gt;'
