  title: THE USE OF SALT AS CLAY SOIL STABILIZATION AGENT IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN
  abstract: A building structure is built on the ground. Therefore, it needs to know
    the properties of soil in order the plan of building structure can be performed
    well. The commonly soil properties is CBR. The higher the scores of CBR the better
    of soil properties. Clay soil generally has low scores of CBR. The attempts to
    improve the original of clay have been conducted, such with soil stabilization.
    One of the clay stabilization materials is salt. The purpose of the particular
    research was to know the scores of CBR clay soil in Central Kalimantan before
    and after stabilized using salt. Clay soil samples were taken from six regencies
    in Central Kalimantan. The clay soil tests performed was CBR test before and after
    the stabilization with salt. The planned salt mixtures were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25%
    and 30% toward the dried content of clay soil. The results of the study showed
    the original soil of CBR score ranges from 3.90% to 4.75%. Then, after stabilization
    5% to 15%, the score of CBR tends to rise of 5% to 9%. Concluded, the CBR score
    has reached the maximum score with salt addition 10% to15% of the weight of the
    soil.
