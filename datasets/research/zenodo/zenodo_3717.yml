  title: ENHANCEMENT OF STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAYEY SOIL USING CEMENT-FLY ASH
    AND GEOGRID
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong> The properties of the soil subgrade have a\
    \ significant impact on how well a pavement performs. The soil must have good\
    \ physical and geotechnical properties to be able to sustain the load and transfer\
    \ it to the ground. The soil that is used in this study is identified as clayey\
    \ soil. When wet, clayey soil becomes stickier and when it\u2019s dry, it develops\
    \ surface fracture. The engineering properties of the soil can be enhanced by\
    \ using additives. In this study, fly ash is added to the soil in varying amounts\
    \ (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) along with 5% of cement to determine the most ideal\
    \ fly ash amount that will increase the soil\u2019s strength. Geogrid is then\
    \ placed at various depths H/4, H/2, and 3H/4 from the top of the soil to determine\
    \ the ideal geogrid placement depth that will increase the soil\u2019s strength\
    \ the most as measured by the CBR value. Atterberg limits, Proctor compaction\
    \ test, unconfined compression strength, and CBR test are the tests used in this\
    \ study. According to the experiment findings, adding fly ash and cement admixtures\
    \ caused the soil\u2019s plasticity to decrease, and MDD to rise with a decrease\
    \ in OMC. Soil that had 10% fly ash and 5% cement showed the highest value of\
    \ CBR, increasing 7.50 times that of untreated soil and having a UCC strength\
    \ of 194.77 kPa. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Soil Stabilization, Cement, Fly Ash,\
    \ Geosynthetic, Geogrid"
