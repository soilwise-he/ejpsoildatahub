  title: The structure of soil macrofauna communities on islands of the Volga river
  abstract: "River islands are of great interest in terms of habitat fragmentation\
    \ and varying abiotic factors. This study presents results of observation of varied\
    \ in size and condition islands of Kuybyshev reservoir, located in the middle\
    \ flow of the Volga river. We recorded 27 taxonomic groups which related to 3\
    \ types, 7 classes and 12 invertebrate orders. Soil macrofauna abundance on islands\
    \ was comparable with the mainland biotopes. The main factor influencing soil\
    \ macrofauna structure was soil type. Island size and height, anthropogenic impact\
    \ and vegetation contributed into soil community\u2019s structure variation too."
