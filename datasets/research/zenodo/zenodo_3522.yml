  title: Heavy Metal Content of Cocoa Plantation Soil in East Kolaka, Indonesia
  abstract: Investigations of pH and heavy metals contents of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, and
    Zn in cocoa plantations soil of East Kolaka has been conducted by using pH starter
    Ohaus 3000 and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) Shimadzu AA6300. Based on
    the investigation, it is known that acidic soil plantation with pH ranges between
    4.45 to 6.26, and also contains Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, and Zn with an average concentration
    (mg/kg) are 1.45, 0.02, 0.85, 0.77, and 1.49, respectively. The existence of Pb
    and Cd in plantation soil have been exceeded the WHO permissible, whereas Ni,
    Cu, and Zn is still within the permissible limits. Acidic soil plantation will
    give opportunity metal ions such as Pb 2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+ absorbed
    by plants. Thus causing the accumulation in plant tissues and make the cocoa plants
    stress of heavy metals.
