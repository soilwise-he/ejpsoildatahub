  title: Hazardous Waste Management Approach for  Heavy Metals in Soil by Phytoremediation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of practical applications of phytoremediation
    in the last ten years, involving organic, inorganic, heavy metal, and radionuclide
    remediation. India would find this to be an excellent alternative to conventional
    remediation methods as it is a sustainable and inexpensive process. The huge retention
    of industrial waste in soil resulted in soil pollution which is more hazardous
    due to the long-term persistence of contaminants. A major source of hazardous
    waste products in Bhopal city is the industrial region. Near residential areas,
    industries produce pollution that can be very harmful to human health. The objective
    of this research was to determine which heavy metal accumulators are capable of
    absorption and translocation of heavy metals. In the Govindpura sampling sites,
    Cr and Ni concentrations were higher, while Cd concentrations were lower. Phytoremediation
    was conducted by comparing the heavy metal accumulation of Datura inoxia, Calotropis
    procera, Ricinus commmunis, and Polygonum in vitro cultures.&lt;/p&gt;'
