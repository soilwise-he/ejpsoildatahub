  title: Effectiveness of Soil Erosion Monitoring Strategies in Kuresoi South, Kenya
  abstract: '<strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>Soil erosion is still one of the most important
    land problems and it is linked to land use and land cover changes. To mitigate
    against this, there has been an effort to transfer the management of natural resources
    to local communities especially in the tropics. Many of these initiatives incorporate
    the development of monitoring systems. Local monitoring systems constitute an
    almost compulsory component of any program or project dealing with sustainable
    management of natural resources. The purpose of this study was to assess soil
    erosion monitoring indicators as effective management tools to be used to help
    in monitoring change in natural resources within the study area. The study was
    comprised of a total representative sample population of 68 respondents from Kuresoi
    south catchment which was achieved using Nassiuma coefficient of variation formulae.
    The study adopted a descriptive research design. Data and information was collected
    using questionnaires and interview schedules. Both quantitative and qualitative
    data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences and presented
    in form of charts, tables of frequencies and percentages. The study results revealed
    the effectiveness of soil erosion monitoring indicators, degree of soil erosion
    and natural resource management. The study therefore recommends that it is important
    to introduce capacity building programs to the community and other stakeholders
    through creation of awareness and training so that they can have knowledge on
    these factors and thus implement the appropriate mitigation measures.'
