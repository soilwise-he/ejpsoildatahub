  title: 'The Role of Phosphate-Solubilizing Microorganisms in Soil Health and Phosphorus
    Cycle: A Review'
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The role of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) in soil health
    and Phosphorus (P) cycle is a crucial aspect of agricultural productivity. Recent
    research has emphasized the importance of microorganisms in maintaining soil health.
    Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development and
    significantly affects crop productivity. The PSM solubilize phosphate by producing
    metabolites such as organic acids, inorganic acids, hydrogen sulphide, exopolysaccharide,
    and siderophore. Studies have shown that the combination of PSM with phosphate
    fertilizers increase the efficiency of the fertilizers in soils. The efforts have
    been made to integrate exogenous soil microorganisms into P cycling models. This
    review highlights the critical role of microorganisms in maintaining soil health
    and promoting P cycle, emphasizing the importance of incorporating them into soil
    management practices.&lt;/p&gt;'
