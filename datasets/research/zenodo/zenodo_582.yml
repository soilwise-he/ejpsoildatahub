  title: Perennial alley cropping contributes to decrease soil CO2 and N2O emissions
    and increase soil carbon sequestration in a Mediterranean almond orchard
  abstract: "The implementation of alley cropping in orchards can be a sustainable\
    \ strategy to increase farm productivity by crop<br> diversification and contribute\
    \ to climate change mitigation. In this research, we evaluated the short-termeffect\
    \ of alley<br> cropping with reduced tillage on soil CO2 and N2O emissions and\
    \ soil total organic carbon (TOC) in an almond orchard<br> under Mediterranean\
    \ rainfed conditions. We compared an almond monoculture with tillage in all plot\
    \ surface (MC)<br> with almond crop with reduced tillage and growth of Capparis\
    \ spinosa (D1) and almond crop with reduced tillage and<br> growth of Thymus hyemalis\
    \ (D2). For two years, soil CO2 and N2O were measured, with soil sampling at the\
    \ start and<br> end of the experimental period. Results showed that CO2 emission\
    \ rates followed the soil temperature pattern, while<br> N2O emissions were not\
    \ correlated with temperature nor moisture. Soil CO2 emissions were significantly\
    \ higher in<br> MC(87mgm\u22122 h\u22121), with no significant differences between\
    \ D1 and D2 (69mgm\u22122 h\u22121). Some peaks in CO2 effluxes<br> were observed\
    \ after tillage operations during warm days. Soil N2Oemission rateswere not significantly\
    \ different among<br> treatments. Cumulative CO2 and CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions\
    \ were significantly highest in MC. When CO2e emissions<br> were expressed on\
    \ a crop production basis, D2 showed the significantly lowest values (5080 g kg\u2212\
    1) compared to<br> D1 (50,419 g kg\u22121) and MC (87,836 g kg\u22121), owing\
    \ to the high thyme yield, additional to the almond yield. No production<br> was\
    \ obtained for C. spinosa, since at least two more years are required. TOC did\
    \ not change with time in MCneither<br> D1, but it significantly increased inD2\
    \ from3.85 g kg\u22121 in 2019 to 4.62 g kg\u22121 in 2021. Thus, alley cropping\
    \ can contribute<br> to increase the agroecosystem productivity and reduce CO2\
    \ emissions. However, it is necessary to grow"
