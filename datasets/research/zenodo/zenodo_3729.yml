  title: Isolated Phosphate-Solubilizing Soil Bacteria Promotes In vitro Growth of
    Solanum tuberosum L.
  abstract: AbstractThe capacity of four bacterial strains isolated from productive
    soil potato fields to solubilize tricalcium phosphate on Pikovskaya agar or in
    a liquid medium was evaluated. A bacterial strain was selected to evaluate in
    vitro capacity of plant-growth promotion on Solanum tuberosum L. culture. Bacterial
    strain A3 showed the highest value of phosphate solubilization, reaching a 20
    mm-diameter halo and a concentration of 350 mg/l on agar and in a liquid medium,
    respectively. Bacterial strain A3 was identified by 16S rDNA analysis as Bacillus
    pumilus with 98% identity; therefore, it is the first report for Bacillus pumilus
    as phosphate solubilizer. Plant-growth promotion assayed by in vitro culture of
    potato microplants showed that the addition of bacterial strain A3 increased root
    and stems length after 28 days. It significantly increased stem length by 79.3%,
    and duplicated the fresh weight of control microplants. In this paper, results
    reported regarding phosphorus solubilization and growth promotion under in vitro
    conditions represent a step forward in the use of innocuous bacterial strain biofertilizer
    on potato field cultures.
