  title: Influence of Granite Cutting Waste Addition on the Geotechnical Parameters
    of Cohesive Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current study analyzes the effect of granite cutting
    waste addition on the properties of cohesive soil. Representative samples of cohesive
    soils were collected from the Mansehra and Balakot areas of Hazara, Pakistan and
    their major geotechnical properties determined following the standard ASTM procedures.
    The determined properties include the Atterberg limits, i.e. Liquid Limit (LL),
    Plastic Limit (PL), Plasticity Index (PI), and Maximum dry density, Optimum moisture
    contents, Un-confined compressive strength, Activity and Expansion. Both the soils
    are classified as active soils possessing high expansion capacity and low strength
    due to the presence of Ca-montmorillonites. Following an increment of 5%, up to
    25% streaks of cutting waste from Susalgali and Baffa granites were added to the
    Mansehra soil and Balakot soil respectively. A thorough analysis of the test results
    reveals a continuous decrease in the Atterberg limits, optimum moisture contents
    and expansion capacity, and increase in the maximum dry density and overall strength
    of both the soils with increasing amounts of the added granite cutting waste streaks.
    The reduction in Atterberg limits, optimum moisture contents and expansion capacity
    reflects the low activity and lower absorption capacity of the added granite.
    Besides, the concomitant increase in strength and maximum dry density of the treated
    soils suggests suitability of granite waste addition as a potential means for
    enhancing bearing capacity and reducing settlement issues in civil engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
