  title: 'THE QUEST FOR SELF IN ORIYA SOIL:  A STUDY OF  JAYANTA MAHAPATRA''S POETRY'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Post - Independence Indian English poets with their cultural
    roots in their community are facing with the crisis of identity, and their&nbsp;poetry&nbsp;manifests
    their quests for&nbsp;self&nbsp;and roots.&nbsp;We can feel a radical shift in
    their writing&mdash;a shift from the macrocosm of the country to the microcosm
    of the&nbsp;self.&nbsp;In the hands of Nissim Ezekiel, A.K. Ramanujan, R. Parthasarathy,
    Arun Kolatkar, Kamala Das and&nbsp; Jayanta&nbsp;Mahapatra the Indian English&nbsp;Poetry&nbsp;has
    acquired new dimensions. &nbsp;At present,&nbsp;Jayanta&nbsp;Mahapatra stands
    tall in the realm of Modern Indian English&nbsp;Poetry&nbsp;enriching the Indian&nbsp;poetry&nbsp;in
    a different way by dealing sagaciously with the Indian culture in general, and
    the&nbsp;Oriya culture in particular&nbsp;with a mythopoeic vision depicting real&nbsp;Odisha&nbsp;with
    its topography, its folktales, traditions and myths. He uses English idioms for
    Indian text and his poems deal with the question of&nbsp;self, search for root
    and identity&nbsp;exploring Indian sensibility and ethos, especially the&nbsp;Odisha&nbsp;landscape,
    its religion and rituals; history and myth; hunger and poverty and the complexity
    of human relationships with wonderful poetic craftsmanship.&nbsp;Although Christian
    by birth, Mahapatra&rsquo;s creative&nbsp;self&nbsp;is primarily Hindu in terms
    of myth, symbols, folklore, idiom&nbsp;and&nbsp;psyche. He learnt to respect Christ
    but his inner&nbsp;self&nbsp;is ardently Hindu.&nbsp;This dual identity has created
    a sense of insecurity and alienation in his&nbsp;poetry.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    My paper aims to present Mahapatra&rsquo;s&nbsp;quest&nbsp;for&nbsp;self&nbsp;identity
    in&nbsp;Oriya&nbsp;soil through his consciousness of the&nbsp;Oriya&nbsp;tradition
    and culture with which he identifies himself in&nbsp;his&nbsp;poetry.&lt;/p&gt;'
