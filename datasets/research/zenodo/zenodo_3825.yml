  title: Effects of climatic variability and soil quality on the production of large
    cardamom in Dhankuta
  abstract: "This research was objectively carried out to assess the current status\
    \ of large cardamom production, major climatic induced impact on production and\
    \ challenges faced by farmers of Dhankuta district and soil fertility status.\
    \ The local farmers were categorized as large, medium and small. The farmers of\
    \ Majhgaun-4 of Pakhribas municipality and Namjang-6 of Chhattar Jorpati municipality\
    \ growing large cardamom were selected for this study. The field work was conducted\
    \ applying stratified random sampling between July to August, 2019.Total 90 questionnaire\
    \ survey and 2 key informant interview were organized to collect the primary data.\
    \ Total 20 soil samples were collected from 0-30 cm depth. Besides, monthly data\
    \ of temperature and rainfall were collected from Department of Hydrology and\
    \ Meteorology. The result showed that the average household production of large,\
    \ medium and small farmers of Majhgaun-4 has been decreasing with an average rate\
    \ of 0.363 ton/ha, 0.088 ton/ha 0.078 ton/ha per year respectively. Mann Kendall\u2019\
    s tau correlation showed that there was a significant relationship of average\
    \ annual temperature and average temperature of critical season of Pakhribas and\
    \ Dhankuta station having R values 0.733 and 0.643 respectively. The rainfall\
    \ in both the station Pakhribas and Dhankuta , was decreasing with the rate of\
    \ -2.696 and -8.618 mm/year. The relation between average household production\
    \ and average temperature of critical season of Majhgaun was significant. The\
    \ soil fertility of Majhgaun was the best. The principal component analysis showed\
    \ that the highest challenges faced by farmers was disease and followed by drought.\
    \ This research will be useful for large cardamom experts."
