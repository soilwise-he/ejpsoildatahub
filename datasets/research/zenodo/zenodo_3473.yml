  title: SOIL CARBON DIOXIDE EVOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO AGRJCULTURAL LAND USE
  abstract: Global climate change due to greenhouse effect induced by the increase
    in the atmospheric carbon dioxide is one of the problems confronting this generation.
    Agricultural land use has been implicated as one of the sources of carbon dioxide
    emission into the atmosphere. This study investigates the influence of land use
    on the emission of CO<sub>2</sub> from the soil. Using a static chamber method
    with the use of alkali to trap CO<sub>2</sub>, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission from
    a maize farm subjected to different management was investigated. An experimental
    plot originally set up to evaluate the influence of the use of difference bush
    fallow species on soil quality and maize yield was evaluated. The treatment consisted
    of Pucraria, Panicurn, Euphorbia, natural fallow and natural fallow with fertilizer
    all of which were ploughed under and then planted to maize. Carbon dioxide emission
    was monitored during the period when the plots were under maize cultivation. The
    result showed that there were no significant differences in the CO<sub>2</sub>
    evolved among the treatments. However, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission was found to
    be positively influenced by soil water content and soil temperature. This study
    demonstrated that arable agricultural soil may contribute as much as 14-18 t ha<sup>-1</sup>
    of CO<sub>2</sub> annually to the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> load. By careful
    manipulation of the soil temperature regime through canopy cover or through some
    vegetated means it may be possible to reduce CO<sub> 2</sub> emission from agricultural
    soils.
