  title: 'Climate Change Impacts in Soil- Water Balance in Semi-Arid Region, Southeast
    of Spain: The use of Eco- Hydrological Model'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Predictions of climate change have a high interest in semiarid
    regions like the province of Alicante (SE Spain). It is expected that the decrease
    of precipitation and the increase of air temperature according to climate change
    forecasts, could impact on the recharge to aquifers. In this context, the aim
    of this study was explore the possible impact of climate changes forecasts on
    recharge in a small aquifer southeastern Spain. Air temperature and precipitation
    data in two climate change scenarios, B2-low and A2-high have been coupled to
    HYDROBAL model. The HYDROBAL software is a useful eco-hydrological model with
    daily resolution for assessing water balances in different vegetation types in
    a semiarid region of southeastern Spain. Based on two models, HYDROBAL and DISRUM,
    water balance was calculated on two scales (vegetation plots and watershed). Over
    the latter period (2071-2099), we expect reduced average annual groundwater recharge,
    of up to 17% (49 mm), if compared to the baseline period (1961-1990).&lt;/p&gt;'
