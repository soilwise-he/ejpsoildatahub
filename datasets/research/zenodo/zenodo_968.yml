  title: A Review of Industrial Crop Yield Performances on Unfavorable Soil Types
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Industrial crop cultivation on marginal agricultural land limits
    indirect land-use change effects that pose a threat to food security. This review
    compiles results from 91 published crop-specific field trial datasets spanning
    12 relevant industrial crops and discusses their suitability for cultivation on
    unfavorable soil types (USTs). It was shown that the perennial species&nbsp;Miscanthus(Miscanthus&nbsp;Andersson)
    and reed canary grass (Phalaris&nbsp;arundinacea&nbsp;L.) performed well on USTs
    with both high clay and/or high sand contents. Information on stoniness (particles
    sizes &gt; 2 mm), where mentioned, was limited. It was found to have only a small
    impact on biological yield potential, though it was not possible to assess the
    impact on mechanization as would be used at a commercial scale. For soils with
    extreme clay or sand contents, half of the crops showed moderate suitability.
    The large yield variations within and between crops revealed large knowledge gaps
    in the combined effects of crop type and agronomy on USTs. Therefore, more field
    trials are needed on diverse USTs in different climates with better equipment
    and more consistent measurements to improve the accuracy of potential yield predictions
    spatially and temporally. Additionally, larger trials are needed to optimize cultivation
    and harvesting&lt;/p&gt;'
