  title: Soil parameter detection of soil test kit-treated soil samples through image
    processing with crop and fertilizer recommendation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Standard laboratory soil testing is deemed to be expensive and
    timeconsuming. Utilizing a soil test kit is considered to be a cost-efficient
    and time-saving way of soil testing. This project study aims to develop a prototype
    that detects soil parameters (i.e., soil pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)
    and gives crop and fertilizer recommendations after the soil sample has undergone
    a soil treatment test kit and its acceptability for possible users. The prototype
    development primarily used image processing to detect the needed parameters that
    lead to crop and fertilizer recommendations. In the evaluation of the effectiveness
    of the prototype, 50 trials were conducted per parameter. All of the said parameters
    were recorded as highly effective except for nitrogen Low, which is interpreted
    as effective only. There were 30 possible users invited to assess the acceptability
    of the prototype. A survey based on the technology acceptance model was administered
    to the 30 respondents garnering a 4.85 weighted mean interpreted as excellent.
    The prototype was proven effective and accepted as a device that can detect soil
    pH and primary macronutrient levels. It gives the appropriate crop and fertilizer
    recommendations based on the gathered data.&lt;/p&gt;'
