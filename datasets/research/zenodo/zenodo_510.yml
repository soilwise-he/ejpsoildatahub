  title: Assessments Of Soil Properties By Using Bacterial Culture.
  abstract: '<strong><strong> </strong>In recent years high rapid development of infrastructures
    in metro cities of useful land and compelled the engineers to improve the properties
    of soil to be the load transferred by the i nfrastructure,ex:Buildings,bridges,roadways
    etc. The soil improvement is continuously increasing using different methods t
    o improve the mechanical properties of different type of soil,such as black cotton,red
    alluvial,murum and sand. The methods of treating soil with chemical and cement
    grout are used widely in geotechnical projects. T he chemical and cement utilized
    alter the subsurface pH level and hinders groundwater flow. To overcome their
    effe ct,more sustainable method is the need of the hour. Hence,an attempt has
    been made to use of microorganisms,nutrients,and biological processes naturally
    present in subsurface soils to improve the engineering pr operties of soil in
    sustainable way. The calcite precipitation was achieved using the microorganism
    BacillusPasteuri i(NCIB8841 or NCIM2477),an aerobic bacterium pervasive in natural
    soil deposits. The permeabilityand she ar strength were conducted in this project
    these experiments demonstrate that indigenous bacteria can induce significant
    quantities of calcite precipitation that calcite precipitation can result in measurable
    changes to geotechnical soil properties. </strong>
