  title: Analysis of the Uptake and Distribution of Heavy Metals in Sweet Corn Grown
    on Municipal Solid Waste Dumpsite Soil in Delta State, Nigeria
  abstract: The build-up of heavy metals in agricultural soils is a growing source
    of worry due to issues with food safety, potential health risks, and negative
    effects on the environment of the soil. This development required investigation
    into the relationship between the quality of the dumpsite-soil metal and the rate
    of plant bioaccumulation. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 -45cm from
    four municipal solid waste dumpsites and farmland within Delta State, Nigeria.
    The municipal solid waste dumpsite selected are the area with heavy domestic and
    industrial waste which were overpopulated. Physico-chemical properties of the
    soil samples were analyzed using standard procedures. The study examined at the
    levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn, and Zn) in the soil and sweet corn
    that was wildly growing on farmland that also had soil from a dumpsite. The statistical
    analysis of variance software SPSS 17 for Windows (SPSS Inc., USA) was used to
    evaluate the data gathered (ANOVA). The results of the soil samples' physicochemical
    analysis showed that the soils from municipal solid waste dumpsites were moderately
    acidic, had sizable amounts of organic matter, and contained some ionisable inorganic
    compounds. The mean concentration of heavy metals found in the dumpsite was higher
    than the metals in the control site. Sweet corn is an excluder plant, a prospective
    accumulator plant, and can make an excellent slope remediation plant, according
    to the results of translocation factors (TF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF)
    for heavy metals. According to the findings, different heavy metals may be categorized
    as mild contaminants (Fe, Cd, and Mn), moderate contaminants (Zn and Pb), and
    severe contaminants (Cu). Except for the sweet corn grown in the control site,
    the levels of heavy metals in the sweet corn grown in the plot with amended dumpsite
    soils above the WHO/FAO permissible limits. The results of the t-test showed values
    of p &lt; 0.05, indicating that there were significant differences in the content
    of heavy metals in the soil and the sweet corn. The study made several recommendations,
    including the creation and enforcement of a rule barring any type of farming on
    the dumpsites, moving the dumpsites outside of the city, and enforcing other environmental
    protection laws to prevent the continued accumulation of these metals there. The
    findings of this study will be very helpful to academics and environmental regulators
    in developing nations.
