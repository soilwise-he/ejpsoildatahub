  title: Physico-Chemical And Microbial Analysis Of Water And Soil Samples In Proposed
    Coal Mine Area At Vidharbha Region, Maharashtra, India
  abstract: The present paper deals with the Physicochemical and Microbial analysis
    of soil and water samples collected from open cast coal mine, Shivaji nagar coal
    mining, wardha River, singada talav, area under the vidharbha region from Maharashtra
    state. Samples were collected in January 2016. Studies were carried out to check
    the quality of water; whether it is safe for drinking purpose or not by the comparative
    physicochemical and microbial analysis of water samples using standard methods.
    We also check the type of soil found there along with its physicochemical properties
    and characterise the different bacteria found in soil.
