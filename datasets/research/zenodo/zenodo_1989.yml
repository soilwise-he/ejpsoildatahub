  title: ASSESSMENT OF HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION IN SOIL IN AND AROUND BIDADI INDUSTRIAL
    AREA, RAMANAGAR DISTRICT
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nThe industrial area in generally is witnessed by red sandy\
    \ soil. The soil covers extends up to 1 to 2 m below the ground level. It is porous,\
    \ non sticky and non clayey. This area is located on a highly undulating terrain.\
    \ The highly undulating topography with dendritic nature has given rise to the\
    \ origin of many hydrological varying characters. The pollution of soil is a source\
    \ of danger to the health of people, even to those living in cities. The anthropogenic\
    \ pollution caused by heavy industries enters plants then goes through the food\
    \ chain and ultimately endangers human health. Due to industrialization, the pollution\
    \ load for water, air and soil has increasing day by day. The present study was\
    \ undertaken on soil contamination in Bidadi Industrial Area, Bidadi, Ramanagara\
    \ Taluk and District. To find out the heavy metal pollution in soil we carried\
    \ out the research work by collecting soil samples from different places in Industrial\
    \ Area. In the present study it reveals that the heavy metal concentrations are\
    \ at the nearby maximum level. The results shows that Zinc varies from 0.06 to\
    \ 4.5 mg/kg, Copper varies from 0.29 to 6.84 mg/kg, Manganese varies from 0.94\
    \ to 32.14 mg/kg, Iron varies from 2.27 to 28.96 mg/kg, Boron varies from 0.12\
    \ to 0.5 mg/kg, Cadmium varies from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg, Chromium varies from 0.11\
    \ to 0.63 mg/kg, Alluminium found in the range of 21.5 to 77.8 mg/kg, P2O5\_ is\
    \ found to be varies from 12 to 96.3 mg/kg, \_K2O varies from 15.4 to 117 mg/kg,\
    \ Organic Carbon is found to be varies from 0.09 to 0.81 and Electric Conductivity\
    \ varies from 0.04 to 0.22. But from results the value of lead is NIL in most\
    \ of the samples which is taken out from the Industrial Area. Soil pH varies from\
    \ 6.30 to 7.50 and is acidic to near neutral and alkaline in nature. Soil pH significantly\
    \ affects the solubility and mobility of these metals, as most of the metals are\
    \ soluble in acid soils than in neutral or slightly basic soils. The methodology\
    \ used has proved to be a useful tool to separate geological and anthropogenic\
    \ causes of variation in soil heavy metal content and to identify common pollution\
    \ sources.\n\n\_\n\nKey words: Soil contamination, Heavy metals, Industries-Bidadi"
