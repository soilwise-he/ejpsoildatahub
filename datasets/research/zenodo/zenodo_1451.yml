  title: Impact of 2-years practice of organic coffee farming on soil arthropod diversity
  abstract: "Organic farming has been recommended by many experts in the world because\
    \ of its positive ecological impacts such as increasing biodiversity. In Indonesia,\
    \ the practice of organic farming is very widespread, including in smallholder\
    \ coffee plantations. This study was intended to determine the impact of the organic\
    \ farming system applied by smallholder coffee farmers for 2 years on soil arthropod\
    \ diversity. On the two coffee farmlands, the conventional and organics (1 ha\
    \ each), 10 plots of 5 x 20 meters were set and in each of these plots 5 sampling\
    \ points were defined for collecting soil arthropods using pit-fall technique.\
    \ The analysis of arthropod diversity in the two fields was quantified using the\
    \ Shannon-Wiener diversity index model. The results showed that the two compared\
    \ coffee farming systems had the same index of diversity (H ') and evenness (E).\
    \ However, statistical tests using the Hutcheson t-test revealed that the variance\
    \ in diversity of arthropods in organic coffee farms was significantly higher\
    \ than in conventional ones (\u03B1 &lt;0.001). Therefore, it can be concluded\
    \ that the practice of organic coffee farming, although in a short time, has been\
    \ able and potent to increase the population and/or diversity of soil animals."
