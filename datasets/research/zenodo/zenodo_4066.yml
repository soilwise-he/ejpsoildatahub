  title: Effect of Pond Ash and RBI Grade 81 on Properties of Subgrade Soil and Base
    Course of Flexible Pavement
  abstract: 'Abstract:

    The strength of subgrade and base course of road is measured in terms of California
    Bearing Ratio (CBR) value. The crust thickness of road section depends on CBR
    value of subgrade soil, base course and traffic intensity. The CBR value of clayey
    soil is poor and therefore it is not suitable as a subgrade material of road.
    This paper deals with use of pond ash and RBI Grade 81 for improvement in CBR
    values of clayey soil and grade-III materials used for base course of flexible
    pavement. The pond ash is a thermal power plant waste and RBI Grade 81 is chemical
    soil stabilizer. The geotechnical properties like Maximum Dry Density (MDD), Optimum
    Moisture Content (OMC), Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), CBR value and Differential
    Free Swell (DFS) index of soil are tested in the laboratory for different mixes
    of soil, pond ash and RBI Grade 81 for different proportions. The mixes of grade-III
    material, pond ash and RBI Grade 81 tested for CBR test. From the study it is
    found that the geotechnical properties of clayey soil are improved significantly,
    if pond ash added with RBI Grade 81. The optimum mix recommended for subgrade
    is soil: pond ash: RBI Grade 81 in proportions of 76:20:4. The CBR value of grade-III
    base course treated with 20% pond ash and 4% RBI Grade 81 is increased by 125.93%
    as compared to untreated grade-III base course.'
