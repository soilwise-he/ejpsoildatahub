  title: Assessment of the Microbial Diversity of Spent-Oil Contaminated Soil in Calabar,
    Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to assess the total heterotrophic and\
    \ hydrocarbon oxidizing microbial diversity, determine the physicochemical parameters\
    \ of oil contaminated soil and evaluate the potentials of microorganisms isolated\
    \ to utilize spent oil. Three mechanic workshops within Calabar South axis of\
    \ Cross River State Nigeria were selected and three soil samples were collected\
    \ from each site. The total heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated on nutrient\
    \ agar and the hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria on minimal salt medium using the\
    \ vapor phase method after employing the ten-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:100000.\
    \ The total heterotrophic mean count ranged from 1.28\xD710&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;to\
    \ 3.58\xD710&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g while mean count of hydrocarbon utilizing\
    \ bacteria varied from 1.94\xD710&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 7.34\xD710&lt;sup&gt;4\
    \ &lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g. Physicochemical parameters of samples were determined. Such\
    \ parameters included pH, electrical conductivity and compounds such as nitrate,\
    \ nitrite, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and potassium. The bacterial isolates\
    \ evaluated belonged to the genera of &lt;em&gt;Bacillus, Klebsiella, Proteus,\
    \ Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Flavobacterium and Micrococcus spp. Klebsiella spp&lt;/em&gt;.\
    \ emerged as the most prevalent heterotrophic bacteria with 29.41% while &lt;em&gt;Bacillus\
    \ spp&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus spp&lt;/em&gt;. were the least prevalent\
    \ with 11.77%. Among the hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas\
    \ flourescens &lt;/em&gt;was the most prevalent species with 53.85% while &lt;em&gt;Micrococcus\
    \ spp&lt;/em&gt;. was the least with 15.39%. Amongst the 3 different sites studied,\
    \ the mechanic workshop at Goldie Street had the highest mean value for both heterotrophic\
    \ and hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria ranging from 2.52x10&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;to\
    \ 3.58 x10&lt;sup&gt;4\_ &lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g for total heterotrophs and 3.27x10&lt;sup&gt;4\
    \ &lt;/sup&gt;to 7.34x10&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g for hydrocarbon utilizers.\
    \ The findings reveal that there is a high prevalence of certain populations of\
    \ active indigenous hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria which can be monitored and\
    \ enhanced to bring about bioremediation in the study area.&lt;/p&gt;"
