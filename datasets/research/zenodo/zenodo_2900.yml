  title: 'Integrating Remote Sensing and Landscape Characteristics to Estimate Soil
    Salinity Using Machine Learning Methods: A Case Study from Southern Xinjiang,
    China'
  abstract: 'Soil salinization, one of the most severe global land degradation problems,
    leads to the loss of arable land and declines in crop yields. Monitoring the distribution
    of salinized soil and degree of salinization is critical for management, remediation,
    and utilization of salinized soil; however, there is a lack of thorough assessment
    of various data sources including remote sensing and landscape characteristics
    for estimating soil salinity in arid and semi-arid areas. The overall goal of
    this study was to develop a framework for estimating soil salinity in diverse
    landscapes by fusing information from satellite images, landscape characteristics,
    and appropriate machine learning models. To explore the spatial distribution of
    soil salinity in southern Xinjiang, China, as a case study, we obtained 151 soil
    samples in a field campaign, which were analyzed in laboratory for soil electrical
    conductivity. A total of 35 indices including remote sensing classifiers (11),
    terrain attributes (3), vegetation spectral indices (8), and salinity spectral
    indices (13) were calculated or derived and correlated with soil salinity. Nine
    were used to model and estimate soil salinity using four predictive modelling
    approaches: partial least squares regression (PLSR), convolutional neural network
    (CNN), support vector machine (SVM) learning, and random forest (RF). Testing
    datasets were divided into vegetation-covered and bare soil samples and were used
    for accuracy assessment. The RF model was the best regression model in this study,
    with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.75, and was most effective in revealing the spatial characteristics
    of salt distribution. Importance analysis and path modeling of independent variables
    indicated that environmental factors and soil salinity indices including digital
    elevation model (DEM), B10, and green atmospherically resistant vegetation index
    (GARI) showed the strongest contribution in soil salinity estimation. This showed
    a great promise in the measurement and monitoring of soil salinity in arid and
    semi-arid areas from the integration of remote sensing, landscape characteristics,
    and using machine learning model.'
