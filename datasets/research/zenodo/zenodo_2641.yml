  title: Excessive nitrogen application under moderate soil water deficit decreases
    photosynthesis, respiration, carbon gain and water use efficiency of maize
  abstract: The impact of water stress and nitrogen (N) nutrition on leaf respiration
    (R), carbon balance and water use efficiency (WUE) remains largely elusive. Therefore,
    the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of soil water
    and N stresses on growth, physiological responses, leaf structure, carbon gain
    and WUE of maize. The plants were subjected to different soil water and N regimes
    to maturity. The results showed that the photosynthesis (A<sub>n</sub>) and stomatal
    conductance (G<sub>s</sub>) decreased significantly under the water stressed treatments
    across the N treatments mainly ascribed to the decreased plant water status. The
    moderate water stress reduced the photosynthetic capacity and activity and also
    caused damage to the structure of leaves, resulting in the significant reduction
    of A<sub>n</sub>, and thus decreased WUE<sub>i</sub>. The dark respiration (R<sub>d</sub>)
    was significantly decreased due to the damage of mitochondria, however, the R<sub>d</sub>/A<sub>n</sub>
    increased significantly and the carbon gain was seriously compromised, eventually
    inhibiting biomass growth under the moderately water stressed treatment. Increasing
    N dose further aggravated the severity of water deficit, decreased A<sub>n</sub>,
    G<sub>s</sub> and WUE<sub>i</sub>, damaged the structure and reduced the number
    of mitochondria of leaves, while increased R<sub>d</sub>/A<sub>n</sub> considerably
    under moderate water stress. Consequently, the biomass accumulation, carbon gain
    and plant level WUE<sub>p</sub> in the moderately water stressed treatment decreased
    markedly under the high N supply. Therefore, excessive N application should be
    avoided when plants suffer soil water stress in maize production.
