  title: Effects of integrated application of inorganic and organic fertilizer on
    properties of soil planted with rice
  abstract: Fertilizer application is essential in the improvement of soil quality
    and crop yield; it was therefore necessary to investigate the effects of integrated
    application of inorganic and organic base fertilizer on the soil chemical and
    physical properties. This experiment was conducted at the Ambrose Alli University
    Teaching and Research Farm, Ekpoma, Nigeria. The experiment was laid out in a
    Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with seven treatments, replicated three
    times; the treatments were; control (zero application), Indorama granular urea
    (GU), prilled urea (PU), full dose of P&amp;K+75% Indorama granular urea (GUPK),
    full dose of P&amp;K+75% prilled urea (PUPK), full dose of P&amp;K+75% Indorama
    granular urea + 25% FYM (GUP&amp;K+FYM), and full dose of P&amp;K+75% prilled
    urea + 25% FYM (PUP&amp;K+FYM). The rice variety cultivated was FARO 59. The initial
    results of the soil analyses showed that the soil was low in nutrient below critical
    values, the combine application of organic and inorganic fertilizer significantly
    (p&lt;0.05) improved soil nutrient status compared to the other treatments. The
    combined application of inorganic and organic fertilizer increased soil pH value
    from 5.64 in control to 6.92. There was a significant (p&lt; 0.05) improvement
    of the macro and micronutrient from the integrated application of inorganic and
    organic based fertilizers compared to other treatments. The application of GUP&amp;K+FYM
    and PUP&amp;K+FYM significant (p&lt; 0.05) improved the Aggregate stability of
    the soil. The integrated applications of organic and inorganic fertilizer (GUP&amp;K+FYM
    and PUP&amp;K+FYM) will significantly (p&lt; 0.05) improve the chemical and physical
    properties of soil.
