  title: A Comparative Study on pH of Soil From Different Areas of Mumbai Region,
    India
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mumbai is situated at the top of the Ulhas River on the western
    coast of India. It is covered by the Arabian Sea to the west. In Mumbai sandy
    soil is predominantly present due to its proximity to the sea. The present study
    was conducted during the winter season month of March and April 2017 2018 from
    inhabited areas. Soil samples were collected from different areas of Mumbai. Soil
    pH and moisture content in soil were measured by using the standard method. The
    standard deviation was conducted on all variables. Our study showed that the pH
    value is in the alkaline range in different areas of Mumbai. It could be due to
    the decreased ground level of water, industrialization, pollution, inhabitation,
    and heavy construction in the area. Our study suggests that alkaline soils increase
    the salt content, could lower nutrition and mineral absorption leading to difficulty
    in taking up agricultural production. Leena Muralidharan | Sangeeta Gaur | Chinmay
