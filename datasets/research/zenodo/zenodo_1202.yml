  title: The potential of biofumigation to control soil borne pests, pathogens and
    weeds
  abstract: "Problem Soil borne pests and pathogens can bring major constraints to\
    \ crop production and their suppression often relies on synthetic chemicals that\
    \ can be ineffective and/or expensive. A crop protection approach with broad efficacy\
    \ and applicable for a wide range of crops and agronomic situations is needed.\
    \ A group of UK growers who have been using and developing biofumigation and two\
    \ industry experts in the field have explored the practicalities of applying the\
    \ technique. This abstract is based on their findings which were discussed in\
    \ a workshop that formed the basis for the \u2018Agroecology in Focus\u2019 podcast\
    \ (see \u2018Further Information\u2019). Solution Biofumigation involves incorporating\
    \ brassicaceous cover crops into the soil; they produce a range of secondary metabolites\
    \ including glucosinolates which can control pests. Brassicas also contain an\
    \ enzyme called myrosinase. When combined with water and glucosinolates, this\
    \ enzyme produces volatile compounds (isothiocyanates) which help limit the proliferation\
    \ of certain pathogens (bacteria, fungi, nematodes) and weeds. However, the effects\
    \ of crops grown as biofumigants can be variable, with the impacts of the biomass\
    \ and glucosinolates depending on how the crops are managed and the soil conditions.\
    \ It is therefore important to make appropriate practical changes at the farming\
    \ system level."
