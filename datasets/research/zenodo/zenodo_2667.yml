  title: Methods for Determining Soil Contamination by Oil and Petroleum Products
    and Indicator Plants in the North of Caspian Sea
  abstract: "<em>In accordance with the Law\u201D On environmental protection \u201C\
    and \" the plan of comprehensive measures to improve the environmental situation\
    \ in the Republic of Azerbaijan (for 2006-2010)\", as well as a program on the\
    \ scientific topic, revealed methods for studying soil contamination with oil\
    \ and petroleum products on the Northern coast of the Caspian Sea and on the basis\
    \ of this were studied plants-indicators.<br> Since the second half of the XX\
    \ century, anthropogenic factors and technogenic impacts on the environment have\
    \ been increasing in our country, as well as in the area of oil fields, oil products,\
    \ mineralized water, etc. negatively affect vegetation in the zone of oil production,\
    \ as well as due to waste pollution, soil fertility is degraded, and vegetation\
    \ is subjected to digression.</em>"
