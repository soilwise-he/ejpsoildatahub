  title: COMPARITIVE ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC MATTER AND MICROBIAL POPULATION FROM SURFACE
    AND DREDGED SOIL OF CHELIKERE LAKE, BANGALORE
  abstract: '<strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong>


    <strong><em>M</em></strong><em>icroorganisms are involved in a variety of biogeochemical
    processes in natural environments. Dissolved organic matter is primarily composed
    of soluble portions of fresh plant and animal residues. Particulate organic matter
    is partially resistant to microbial decomposition and serves as an important long
    term supply of nutrients. Chelikery Reservoir is an important reservoir of water
    and a typical eutrophic freshwater lake. From the lake soil samples were collected
    from surface and dredged soil of Chelikery lake, Bangalore, and then the Walkley
    Black Method used for determining soil organic matter using volume of acidic dichromate
    solution reacting with determined amount of soil in order to oxidize the organic
    matter. And microbial diversity by standard microbial plate counting method. Results
    showed that the dredged soil had a more organic matter and microbial population
    than surface soil. The distribution pattern of Organic matter and microbial population
    is changing irregularly along with rivers and their environmental changesand alsovary
    upon their complex interactions between soil properties, microbial population
    and SOM chemistry.</em>
