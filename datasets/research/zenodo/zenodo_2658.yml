  title: Investigation On Ground Water, Soil And Vegetation Quality With Special Reference
    To Heavy Metals Around Bellandur Lake Area, Bengaluru
  abstract: In recent years, environmental pollution is a major problem in most of
    the cities and it is also one of the causes for human health issues. Heavy metal
    pollution have arisen the interest in researchers, because of its potential health
    hazards to the humans even at low concentration. This project work provides an
    insight about the level of contamination in the ground water, soil and also in
    vegetation around the Bellandur Lake, Bengaluru. Bellandur Lake was once upon
    a time, major source of water to the localities, now it stands as one of most
    highly polluted lakes in Bengaluru. The elevated concentration of pollutants in
    the lake is mainly because of the direct discharge of effluents into the lake
    water from the surrounding areas. This lake water is being used for irrigation
    of crops cultivated around the lake. Usage of contaminated water for irrigation
    of crops is a main cause for accumulation of heavy metals in the soil pores. Therefore
    in this project work, the distribution and migration of heavy metals in soil is
    studied along with the impact of contaminated soil on vegetation around Bellandur
    Lake, where the lake water is used for the cultivation of vegetables.
