  title: The Physicochemical Analysis of Soil from N. Solapur Region, Maharashtra
  abstract: 'Abstract-



    Soil is one of natural body of mineral and organic material differentiated into
    horizons, also differs themselves from underlying materials in their morphology,
    physical constituents, chemical composition as well as biological characteristics.
    Solapur is the city which is famous for industrialization, forest areas etc. The
    plants generally depend on the soils for their nutrients, water and minerals supply,
    the soil type is a major factor for determining the growth of plants. The soil
    health and soil quality are both the same words but the soil quality it basically
    more focused on its physico-chemical, and biological characters. A study of soil
    quality may helpful to give set of parameters which may be the evidence of the
    soil ability to carry out its functions.



    The present study based on the physico-chemical analysis of soil parameters from
    Solapur region. The good quality of soil depends on its different properties such
    as; soil PH, Potassium, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, total organic compound etc. The
    present study focused on the availability of nutrient quality of soil. On seasonal
    basis soil of area shows great variation regarding the soil nutrients. The pH
    of soil is found to be neutral for all season. In summer season availability of
    P is medium compared to other season. Organic carbon and K are found to be excess
    in all seasons. In overall the present investigation provides information regarding
    the nutrient quality of soil which will provide great information for any problem
    related to soil and plants growth. It is concluded that variable concentrations
    of various parameters and irregular distributions of nutrients may be due to the
    added fertilizers during crop formation.'
