  title: Incidence of Soil-Transmitted Helminths in Soil Samples from Various Sub-Urban
    Areas of Yangon Environs
  abstract: "This study was conducted to find out the incidence of soil-transmitted\
    \ helminths (STHs) in soil samples randomly collected from the three primary schools\
    \ in Yangon during July 2007 to February 2008. Study sites included were primary\
    \ schools from Insein, Mayangone and North-Dagon townships. Approximately one\
    \ gram of soil samples were collected from three study sites on a monthly basis.\
    \ Three replicate samples were taken from each study. The incidence of STHs were\
    \ examined according to the methods described by WHO (1991). All helminth ova\
    \ and larvae were classified according to Brown (1964). In the present study,\
    \ the ova and larvae of five helminth species were observed, namely (1) Ascaris\
    \ spp., ova, (2) Enterobius vermicularis, ova (3) Trichuris trichiura, ova (4)\
    \ Strongyloides stercoralis, larvae and (5) Taenia spp., ova. The soil samples\
    \ from North-Dagon primary school showed highest incidence of STHs. The second\
    \ highest incidence of STH was observed for Insein primary school and Mayangone\
    \ primary school showed the lowest incidence of STH. In addition, the higher incidence\
    \ rates of helminth ova and larvae in soil were observed in monsoon months (July\
    \ \u2013 September). Study also revealed that Ascaris species was the most dominant\
    \ helminth in all soil samples. The second most dominant helminths were Enterobius\
    \ and Trichiuris species. The lowest STHs were Strogyloides and Taenia species."
