  title: Modelling Changes In Forest Soil Chemistry In The Oldest Spruce Stands In
    The Potok Dupnianski Catchment In Southern Poland Using Forsafe Model
  abstract: "The dynamic forest ecosystem model ForSAFE was applied to the oldest\
    \ spruce forest stand in a forested catchment \u2013 the Potok Dupnia\u0144ski\
    \ (southern Poland), to study changes in forest soil chemistry and possible recovery\
    \ from acidification following changes in atmospheric deposition. The simulation\
    \ shows a considerable historical acidification. The model uses data from intensive\
    \ monitoring of a plot established in 1999 in a spruce stand which was planted\
    \ in 1880. Observations showed that stand soil was depleted of base cations. Percent\
    \ base saturation measured in 1999<br>\nwas between 5\u2013 8% in different soil\
    \ layers. Notwithstanding large emission reductions in the region, forest ecosystems\
    \ in the Potok Dupnia\u0144ski still suffer from very high loads of acidifying\
    \ input. Soil recovery depends on future<br>\nemission, and especially on base\
    \ cation and nitrogen deposition. While higher base cation deposition will promote\
    \ recovery, continual elevated nitrogen deposition in the future may delay recovery\
    \ owing to its interference in the biogeochemical cycle (e.g. by increasing base\
    \ cation uptake from the soil)."
