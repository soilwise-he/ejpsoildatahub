  title: Enzymes Involved In The Detoxification Of H2O2 In The Leaves And Roots Of
    Wheat Subjected To Long-Term Soil Drought
  abstract: 'The dynamics of the activity of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol
    peroxidase and benzidine peroxidase, as well as the level of hydrogen peroxide
    in the vegetative organs of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) cultivars was studied
    under long-term soil drought conditions. It was established that hydrogen peroxide
    generation occurred at early stages of stress in the tolerant variety Barakatli-95,
    whereas in the susceptible variety Garagylchyg-2 its significant amounts were
    accumulated only at later stages. The highest activity of catalase which plays
    a leading role in the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide was observed in the
    leaves and roots of the drought tolerant variety Barakatli-95. Despite the fact
    that the protection system also includes peroxidases, the activity of these enzymes
    even after synthesis of their new portions is substantially lower compared with
    catalase. Native PAGE electrophoresis revealed the presence of one isoform of
    CAT, seven isoforms of APX, three isoforms of GPO and three isoforms of BPO in
    the leaves, and also three isoforms of CAT, four isoforms of APX, two isoforms
    of GPO and six isoforms of BPO in the roots of wheat. One isoform of CAT was found
    in the roots when water supply is normal and three isoforms were observed under
    drought conditions. Stress associated with long-term soil drought in the roots
    of wheat has led to an increase in the heterogeneity due to the formation of two
    new sedentary forms of catalase: CAT2 and CAT3.'
