  title: Modeling Of Heat And Mass Transfer In Soil Plant-Atmosphere. Influence Of
    The Spatial Variability Of Soil Hydrodynamic
  abstract: 'The modeling of water transfer in the unsaturated zone

    uses techniques and methods of the soil physics to solve the

    Richards-s equation. However, there is a disaccord between the size

    of the measurements provided by the soil physics and the size of the

    fields of hydrological modeling problem, to which is added the

    strong spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties. The objective of

    this work was to develop a methodology to estimate the

    hydrodynamic parameters for modeling water transfers at different

    hydrological scales in the soil-plant atmosphere systems.'
