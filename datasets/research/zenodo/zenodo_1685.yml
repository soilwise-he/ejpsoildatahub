  title: Pig Slurry Influence on Soil Physio-Chemical Properties in Ngor Okpala, Imo
    State, Nigeria
  abstract: Recently, the importance of organic manure in enhancing soil physico-chemical
    properties cannot be overemphasized. Therefore a study was conducted to investigate
    pig slurry influence on soil physico-chemical properties in Ngor Okpala Imo State
    Nigeria. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)
    with five (5) treatments replicated four (4) times. Data obtained was analyzed
    using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and significant means were separated using
    Fisher least significant difference (F-LSD) at probability level of (P=0.05).
    The treatments consisted of P0-control. P1- pig slurry at 10 t ha-1, P2- pig slurry
    at 20 t ha-1 , P3- pig slurry at 30 t ha-1 and P4- pig slurry at 40 t ha-1. The
    result showed that application of pig slurry at10 t ha-1, 20 t ha-1, 30 t ha-1
    and 40 t ha-1 significantly (P= 0.05) improved the soil total porosity, moisture
    content and decreased the soil bulk density. Also the application of pig slurry
    at different rates improved the soil pHw, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available
    phosphorous, exchangeable bases, Effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and
    percentage base saturation and significantly decreased the soil total exchangeable
    acidity. The trend of improving the soil physico-chemical properties was 40 t
    ha-1, 30 t ha-1, 20 t ha-1, 10 t ha-1 and 0 t ha-1. Therefore, it is recommended
    that farmers should use pig slurry in improving soil physico-chemical properties
    particularly at 40 t ha-1 rate of application.
