  title: Soil Type as One of the Major Contributing Factors for Top Ten Agri-Producing
    States of India
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A heterogeneous mixture of small rock particles/debris and organic
    materials/humus is called soil. It is usually produced over the surface of the
    earth and helps in the sustenance of autotrophic life in plant. India is an agriculture
    based country in which West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh,
    Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka are considered
    as the top ten stated for their higher agricultural productivity. For higher agricultural
    productivity, knowledge of soil type, composition, texture, fertility, etc. is
    highly essential. However, no review article is presently summarising whether
    the soil type contributes as one of the major factors for the above top ten ranked
    agri-producing states of India. Here we review and found that the soil type could
    be one of the major reasons why the above states topped the list in agricultural
    attributes to India. As per India classifi cation, both urvara (fertile) and usara
    (sterile) soils are found in the country. Majority of Indian soils harboring the
    agriculture of the above states are alluvial soil (43%), red soil (18.5%), black/regur
    soil (15%) and the rest are arid/desert soil, laterite soil, saline soil, peaty/marshy
    soil, forest soil and sub-mountain soil that harbors the agriculture in India
    in general and in the above states in particular. Therefore, the soil type present
    in the above states is one of the most contributing factors for the higher agriculture
    productivity in India.&lt;/p&gt;'
