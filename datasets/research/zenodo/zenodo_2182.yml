  title: Biodegradability and ecotoxicity of a biobased and biodegradable mulch film
    using key organisms in soil ecosystems
  abstract: "Biobased and biodegradable plastic mulch films are an increasingly attractive\
    \ alternative to their conventional counterparts, with the promise of safeguarding\
    \ the health of agricultural soils and their inhabitants through the complete\
    \ biodegradation of the material (and consequent elimination of removal costs)\
    \ contributing to the value of these mostly petrochemical-independent materials.\
    \ However, these plastics' current certification processes prove themselves lacklustre\
    \ in predicting biodegradation performance and ecotoxicological effects in natural\
    \ settings, the relatively few studies done on the topic disputing this perceived\
    \ environmental-friendliness. This study assessed the biodegradation of a commercially-available\
    \ biobased and biodegradable mulch film by the soil-dwelling fungal species Penicillium\
    \ brevicompactum, in solid culture media and locally sourced agricultural soil,\
    \ for the duration of 15 and 28 days, as well as the ecotoxicological effects\
    \ of microplastics from the same material on the key earthworm species Eisenia\
    \ andrei, at environmentally-relevant concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 0.500\
    \ grams per kilogram of soil, both in their pristine state and after UV-C radiation\
    \ weathering. The results obtained in the biodegradation assays \u2013 mass variation,\
    \ microscopic analysis and FTIR analysis \u2013 suggest P. brevicompactum's capability\
    \ to accelerate the mulch film's natural biodegradation process. In the ecotoxicological\
    \ assays, exposure to any concentration of pristine microplastics seemed to increase\
    \ E. andrei's sensitivity to touch, had apparent adverse effects on energy reserves,\
    \ and resulted in significant decreases in offspring numbers (upwards of 30%);\
    \ conversely, weathered microplastics seemed to show no such negative effects,\
    \ bar specimen sensitivity. Since the mulch film's weathering is expected to happen\
    \ if properly used, the studied material seems to be an environmentally-friendly\
    \ alternative, given its potential for faster biodegradation by normal soil dwellers\
    \ and low toxicity to a key-species in the ecosystem. Notwithstanding, these findings\
    \ highlight the shortcomings of currently applied standards, that can ignore the\
    \ role of chronic ecotoxicological effects on naturally-occurring organisms. Also\
