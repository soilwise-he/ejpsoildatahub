  title: Effect of brown manuring on weed dynamics, crop yield and soil fertility
    in wet seeded rice
  abstract: A field experiment was conducted at Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru College of
    Agriculture and Research Institute (PAJANCOA & RI), Karaikal, during thaladi season
    of 2020-21 to study the "Effect of brown manuring on weed dynamics, crop yield
    and soil fertility in wet seeded rice". The experiment was laid out with ten treatments
    in a randomized block design and replicated thrice. The treatments were rice co-culture
    with daincha 15 kg ha-1 and 2,4-D 0.5 kg ha-1 (T1), rice co-culture with daincha
    20 kg ha-1 and 2,4-D 0.5 kg ha-1 (T2), rice coculture with daincha 25 kg ha-1
    and 2,4-D 0.5 kg ha-1 (T3), rice co-culture with daincha 15 kg ha-1 and bispyribac
    sodium 25 g ha-1 (T4), rice co-culture with daincha 20 kg ha-1 and bispyribac
    sodium 25 g ha-1 (T5), rice co-culture with daincha 25 kg ha-1 and bispyribac
    sodium 25 g ha-1 (T6), rice sole cropping with 2,4-D 0.5 kg ha-1 (T7), rice sole
    cropping with bispyribac sodium 25g ha-1 (T8), rice sole crop with hand weeding
    twice at 20 and 40 DAS (T9) and unweeded control (T10), (without daincha and weed
    management). The Brown manuring practices influenced the yield and soil fertility
    of the WSR. Among the treatments, rice with daincha 25 kg ha-1 + 2,4-D 0.5 kg
    ha-1 was found to be effective in increasing yield and soil nutrient status compared
    to rice alone (without brown manuring).
