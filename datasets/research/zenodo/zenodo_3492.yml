  title: Analysis and Experimental Study of Optimal Soil Moisture Sensor Probe Length
  abstract: two parallel needle moisture sensors has been widely used in Soil moisture
    detection equipment, for example, frequency domain (FD), time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) and standing wave ratio (SWR) measurement. The design of probe's port impedance
    is key technology parameters to soil moisture sensor. In this study, according
    to the relationships between the length and impedance characteristics of terminal
    open and closed state probe were presented based on two-pin probe structure of
    parallel resistance model. The best probe structure was simulated by high frequency
    structure simulator software HFSS, which based on Maxwell's equations and finite
    element method. According to experiment of soil water content by organic solution,
    the theoretical analysis of the best structure of probe was further validated.
