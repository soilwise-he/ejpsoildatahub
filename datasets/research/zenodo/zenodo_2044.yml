  title: "\uFEFFImpact of non-native tree species in Europe on soil properties and\
    \ biodiversity: a review"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the context of global change, the integration of non-native
    tree (NNT) species into European forestry is increasingly being discussed. The
    ecological consequences of increasing use or spread of NNTs in European forests
    are highly uncertain, as the scientific evidence is either constraint to results
    from case studies with limited spatial extent, or concerns global assessments
    that lack focus on European NNTs. For either case, generalisations on European
    NNTs are challenging to draw. Here we compile data on the impacts of seven important
    NNTs (Acacia dealbata, Ailanthus altissima, Eucalyptus globulus, Prunus serotina,
    Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus rubra, Robinia pseudoacacia) on physical and chemical
    soil properties and diversity attributes in Europe, and summarise commonalities
    and differences. From a total of 103 publications considered, studies on diversity
    attributes were overall more frequent than studies on soil properties. The effects
    on soil properties varied greatly among tree species and depended on the respective
    soil property. Overall, increasing (45%) and decreasing (45%) impacts on soil
    occurred with similar frequency. In contrast, decreasing impacts on biodiversity
    were much more frequent (66%) than increasing ones (24%). Species phylogenetically
    distant from European tree species, such as Acacia dealbata, Eucalyptus globulus
    and Ailanthus altissima, showed the strongest decreasing impacts on biodiversity.
    Our results suggest that forest managers should be cautious in using NNTs, as
    a majority of NNT stands host fewer species when compared with native tree species
    or ecosystems, likely reflected in changes in biotic interactions and ecosystem
    functions. The high variability of impacts suggests that individual NNTs should
    be assessed separately, but NNTs that lack European relatives should be used with
    particular caution.&lt;/p&gt;'
