  title: "Functional Diversity of Soil Nematodes in Relation to the Impact of Agriculture\u2014\
    A Review"
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the functional diversity of soil nematodes requires
    detailed knowledge on theoretical aspects of the biodiversity&ndash;ecosystem
    functioning relationship in natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems. Basic
    approaches applied are reviewed, focusing on the impact and value of soil nematode
    diversity in crop production and on the most consistent external drivers affecting
    their stability. The role of nematode trophic guilds in two intensively cultivated
    crops are examined in more detail, as representative of agriculture from tropical/subtropical
    (banana) and temperate (apple) climates. The multiple facets of nematode network
    analysis, for management of multi-trophic interactions and restoration purposes,
    represent complex tasks that require the integration of different&lt;br&gt;

    interdisciplinary expertise. Understanding the evolutionary basis of nematode
    diversity at the field level, and its response to current changes, will help to
    explain the observed community shifts. Integrating approaches based on evolutionary
    biology, population genetics and ecology can quantify the contribution of nematode
    fauna to fundamental soil functions. These include carbon transformation, nutrient
    cycling, pest control and disease transmission. In conclusion, different facets
    of nematode diversity such as trophic groups, life history traits, variability
    in body size and/or taxa identities in combination with DNA-based techniques are
    needed in order to disclose nematode&ndash;soil&ndash;ecosystem functioning relationships.
    Further experimental studies are required to define locally adapted and sustainable
    management practices, through ecosystem-based approaches and nature-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;'
