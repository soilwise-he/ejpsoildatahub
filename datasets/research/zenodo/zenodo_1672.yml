  title: Forensic Examination of Soil Samples from the Point of View of Physico-Chemical
    Expertise
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT: The potential of forensic expertise in the analysis of soil
    samples has been recognized for a century now, but over the last 20 years, these
    types of evidence have been much more widely used both as an investigative tool
    and as evidence in court. Forensic Chemistry is at the crossroads of science with
    the law, being a discipline apart from its applicability to the judiciary. Samples
    are obtained from various objects and often contain only very small amounts of
    chemicals. Most of the time, the sample harvested on the spot is no longer sampled,
    but it is actually the sample to be analyzed. This is also the condition of aggregation
    of the sample, the homogeneity of the sample/matrix or the compounds sought. Sometimes,
    however, even the evidence can be considered chemically homogeneous, and then
    representative samples (paints, textiles, plastics, etc.) can be sampled. The
    rest of the materials are heterogeneous (soil, building materials, fire residues,
    etc.). The extremely rapid evolution of science in recent years has resulted in
    the development of new, powerful and performing technologies. This evolution and
    the refinement of analytical tools make it possible at present to perform forensic
    investigations at the smallest scale of dimensions, with greater sensitivity and
    with great differentiation intervals. At the same time it is possible to discover
    unpredictable or previously inaccessible samples. KEYWORDS: chromatography, forensic
    expertise, samples, spectrometry, trace soil'
