  title: EFFECT OF INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON YIELD AND PASSIVE POOLS
    OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN LONG TERM FERTILIZER EXPERIMENT
  abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role order to improve soil properties
    and sustainable production. The different fractions of SOM are more effective
    in indicating changes in soil use than total soil organic matter content. The
    present study was conducted to investigate the effect of integrated nutrient management
    (INM) on yields and passive pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) under groundnut-wheat
    cropping sequence of a Haplustepts soil. Such studies were for the first time
    initiated in long term field experiments initiated during kharif 1999 at Junagadh,
    Gujarat. Effect on varying doses of N, NP, NPK, NPK with FYM, Zn, S and Rhizobium
    on yields and passive pools of SOC viz., Humic acid, Fulvic acid and Humin was
    conducted after 16 year of groundnut-wheat crop sequence was studied. The result
    of the two was compared and conclusion deduced. The result revealed that application
    of 50% NPK + FYM @ 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> to groundnut and 100% NPK to wheat significantly
    increased the groundnut pod and haulm yield, wheat grain and straw yield. The
    highest and significant increase passive pools of soil organic carbon viz., Humic
    acid, Fulvic acid and Humin was also observed under combine application of 50%
    NPK + FYM @ 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> to groundnut and 100% NPK to wheat. These results
    indicate that long-term integrated use of FYM with chemical fertilizers or use
    of FYM alone exerted significant effect on the passive pools of soil organic carbon.
