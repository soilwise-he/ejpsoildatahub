  title: Bioremediation Of Oil-Polluted Soil Of Western Kazakhstan
  abstract: '15 strains of oil-destructing microorganisms were

    isolated from oil polluted soil of Western Kazakhstan. Strains 2-A

    and 41-3 with the highest oil-destructing activities were chosen from

    them. It was shown that these strains oxidized n-alkanes very well,

    but isoalkanes, isoparaffin, cycloparaffin and heavy aromatic

    compounds were destructed very slowly. These both strains were

    tested as preparations for bioremediation of oil-polluted soil in model

    and field experiments. The degree of utilizing of soil oil by this

    preparation was 79-84 % in field experiments.'
