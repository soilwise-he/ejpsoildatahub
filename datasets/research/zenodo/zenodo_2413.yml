  title: Effects of Pig and Goat Droppings on Soil Physiochemical Properties and Yield
    of Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)
  abstract: This study was carried out at the teaching and research farm of the Department
    of Crop Production and Horticulture, Lagos State Polytechnic Ikorodu to determine
    the effects of different levels of goat and pig droppings on the performance of
    cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete
    Block Design with five experimental treatments replicated three times. The treatments
    applied were goat droppings at 5 and 10 tonnes per hectare, pig droppings at 5
    and 10 tonnes per hectare and control 0 tonne per hectare. Data collected were
    vine length (cm), vine girth (cm) number of leaves, number of branches, and days
    to 50% flowering, weight of fruit (kg), number of fruits, length of fruit (cm)
    and width of fruits (cm). The results from the data analysis indicated that number
    of branches of cucumber, its length and diameter were significantly affected by
    the different rates of application of goat and pig droppings. Based on the outcome
    of this study, 5 tonnes per hectare of goat manure should actually be adopted
    for farmers in Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State. However, further
    research should be carried out to determine the rate of manure suitable for the
    optimum yield of cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Farmers are advised to use more tonnes
    of manure at a higher rate to improve soil physiochemical properties and to enhance
    crop growth and yield.
