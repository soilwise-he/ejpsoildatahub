  title: Soil Porosity and Water Infiltration as Influenced by Tillage Practices on
    Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria Soil
  abstract: "Frequency and intensity of Interaction of machine with soil have great\
    \ effect and manipulate the physical and hydraulic properties of soil. The effects\
    \ of agricultural management practices on soil physical parameters aid the effective\
    \ sustainability of soils. In this study, three tillage methods common to the\
    \ study area on porosity and water infiltration were assessed. Tillage treatments\
    \ include zero tillage (Plot covered with vegetation (conservation tillage)),\
    \ disc plough (ploughing to the depth of 16 cm, conventional tillage (CT)) and\
    \ disc harrow (harrowing to a depth of 16 cm, conventional tillage (CT)). Porosity\
    \ was determined by the core method, water infiltration by the double-ring infiltrometer\
    \ and hydraulic conductivity from the steady state flow rate. Based on the result\
    \ obtained there was no significant difference between the zero tillage and disc\
    \ plough tillage while there was significant difference between the zero tillage\
    \ and disc harrow tillage. More so, there was significant difference between the\
    \ plough tillage and harrow tillage. Based on analysis and comparison of results,\
    \ it\u2019s indicated high soil sorptivity, porosity and infiltration capacity\
    \ values for zero tillage follow by disc plough tillage and disc harrow tillage\
    \ respectively. The bulk density decreased with depth for all the tillage practice\
    \ while moisture content and porosity increased with depth for all the tillage\
    \ practices. Furthermore, it has been found that porosity decreased in the order\
    \ disc harrow tillage (49.90 %) follow by disc plough tillage (42.62%) and zero\
    \ tillage (41.17 %) respectively. Meanwhile, infiltration capacity increased in\
    \ the order zero tillage (24.40 cm/hr) follow by disc plough tillage (32.30 cm/hr)\
    \ and disc harrow tillage (39.40 cm/hr). It was also observed that there was positive\
    \ correlation between the infiltration capacity and porosity. The infiltration\
    \ capacity increased with porosity."
