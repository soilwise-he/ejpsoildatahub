  title: Improvement of Pavement Subgrade Soil using Millet Husk Ash for Rural Roads
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the improvement of subgrade soil by using
    Millet Husk Ash (MHA). MHA is a commonly available material found in a significant
    quantity as India is the largest producer of millet in the entire world. The MHA
    was mixed in soil by partially replacing the soil by weight in 0%,2.5%,5%,7.5%,10%,12.5%
    and 15%. The soil in its natural state was in the form of intermediate plastic
    clay whose dry density got reduced and the optimum moisture content got increased
    after stabilization. The CBR and UCS values increased initially but showed a decrease
    after a certain point. The sudden transition from increasing values to decreasing
    values marks a peak point showing the optimum content of MHA. The optimum content
    of the ash was found to be 10%. A significant increase in the values of UCS and
    CBR was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;'
