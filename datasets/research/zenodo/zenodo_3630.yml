  title: Phytoremediation Studies On Copper And Lead Contaminated Soil By Using Brassica
    Junecea
  abstract: "Phytoremedation is an emerging technology that uses various plants to\
    \ degrade contamination from soil and water. Brassica species close relatives\
    \ of the well-known metal-accumulating wild mustards have received much attention.\
    \ In the present studies investigated that the Brassica junecea was take up of\
    \ concentrate toxic heavy metal like copper and lead from contaminated soil. The\
    \ result revealed that the highest height of the B. juncea was observed in 8th\
    \ weeks of pot IV (38 \xB1 0.4 cm) and followed by copper (37\xB10.5 cm) and lead\
    \ (35\xB10.3 cm) contaminated soil respectively. The fresh weight of these plants\
    \ was increased as compared to control (without metal mix). Increase in fresh\
    \ weight shows that Pb and Cu (102.3\xB12.1 mg) at pot IV in favour of growth\
    \ in B. juncea to compare with other experimental conditions. In this result to\
    \ indicate the combination of Pb and Cu contaminated soil having height removal\
    \ percentage at 8th week (48 %) and other group experiment also."
