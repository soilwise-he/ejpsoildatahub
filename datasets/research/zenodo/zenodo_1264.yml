  title: Actor engagement guide - guidance for engaging actors in land and soil management
  abstract: "It is assumed that the Soil Mission and its related objectives and specific\
    \ targets can only be achieved<br> through healthy soils and for that it is needed\
    \ to engage stakeholders. This is needed because stakeholders:<br> bring in knowledge;\
    \ have the power to make or to block decisions (policy) and measures (management);<br>\
    \ and can ensure the relevance and acceptance of outcomes. Stakeholders are defined\
    \ as those who are<br> affected in their interest or concern by changes in land\
    \ and soil management. When stakeholders<br> effectively engage in the achievement\
    \ of the Soil Mission objectives, they become active and thus actors in<br> soil\
    \ and land management. The guidance to effectively engage actors in land and soil\
    \ management involves<br> the taking of 6 key-steps:<br> 1. Realize why it is\
    \ needed to engage them;<br> 2. Select the actors;<br> 3. Decide upon the appropriate\
    \ level of engagement;<br> 4. Apply the key-principles of actor engagement;<br>\
    \ 5. Select and apply the appropriate engagement tools and formats; and finally<br>\
    \ 6. Reflect on previous steps and make adjustment as needed, lessons are learnt.<br>\
    \ These steps are further elaborated in this document. Furthermore, there are\
    \ examples included of actual<br> engagement of actors in natural resources management\
    \ related cases and tools and formats are suggested<br> that support the engagement\
    \ of actors. It is assumed that actors will only engage in land and soil<br> management\
    \ if they recognize benefits in engagement, or, in other words: see \u2018what\u2019\
    s in for them\u2019.<br> Therefore, also first drafts for tailored value propositions\
    \ to different groups of actors are provided in this<br> document. These drafts\
    \ can serve as a starting point in further engagement of actors from these groups.<br>\
    \ Through engagement with them the drafts can be further refined."
