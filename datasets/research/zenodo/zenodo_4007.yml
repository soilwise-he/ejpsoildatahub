  title: PHENOLOGY OF BUSH-FORAGE SPECIES ESTABLISHED IN A SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEM IN
    TWO SOIL TYPES IN YUCATAN, MEXICO
  abstract: "Silvopastoral systems represent a sustainable alternative for livestock\
    \ production. Such systems are part of agroforestry and represent an agroecosystem\
    \ which can be designed chronological and topological by an arboreal and herbaceous\
    \ component. It has been demonstrated that silvopastoral systems can improve the\
    \ forage production, add firewood and reduce temperature in grassland what generating\
    \ animal wellness. However, to obtain the benefits of a silvopastoral system,\
    \ it is important to know the phenology of forage bushes in a multi-associated\
    \ system. The objective of this work was to evaluate a multi-associated silvopastoral\
    \ system accord of the phenological behavior of four bushes with forage potential\
    \ in two types of soil (Leptosol and Lithosol). The study was carried out in a\
    \ plot of 130 x 25 m. Around the plot was intercalated <em>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis</em>(Tulipan)species\
    \ at 25 cm between plant, <em>Gliricidiasepium</em>(Cocoite)and <em>Guazumaulmifolia</em>(Pixoy)at\
    \ 2 m, and inside of the plot <em>Leucaenaleucocephala</em>(Huaxin) at 50 cmbetween\
    \ plants and3 m between rows. Evaluated treatments were Leptosol or Lithosol soils,\
    \ the variables measured were plant height, basal diameter, diameter at 35 cm,\
    \ branches number, flowering date and pods number, growth rate and surviving.\
    \ The analysis of variance and Duncan test were carried out to detect differences\
    \ between treatments in plant age. The 100% of surviving was observed in Huaxin,\
    \ Pixoy and Tulipan species in both soil types at 10,7 and 10 months of age respectively,\
    \ furthermore, Cocoite showed 69 and 81 % of surviving in Leptosol and Lithosol\
    \ soil respectively at the 6 months of transplant. Plant height of Huaxin at ten\
    \ months of age was (P&lt;0.05) 145.5\xB138.70 cm with growth rate (GR) of 0.66\xB1\
    0.19 cm d<sup>-1 </sup>in Leptosol soil and 138.2\xB146.71 cm for Lithosol with\
    \ GR of 0.62\xB10.16 cm d<sup>-1</sup>. Flowering was in winter at 5 age months.\
    \ Pods productions differences (P&lt;0.05) were observed in Leptosol with 56.3\xB1\
    49.41 pods and in Lithosol with 45\xB143.74 pods. The growth rate of Pixoy at\
    \ seven months of age was (P&lt;0.05) 133.0\xB129.00 cm in Leptosol with 0.68\xB1\
    14 cm d<sup>-1 </sup>and 101.0\xB127.33 cm in Lithosol soil with 0.52\xB1138 cm\
    \ d<sup>-1</sup>. The highest Tulipan plants at ten mons age were (P&lt;0.05)\
    \ 163\xB136.10 cm with 0.68\xB10.12 cm d<sup>-1</sup> of GR in Leptosol soil and\
    \ 147.7\xB120.38 cm with 0.62\xB10.07 cm d<sup>-1</sup> of GR in Lithosol soil.\
    \ For all variables in soil treatment were detected differences (P&lt;0.05), in\
    \ which, Leptosol showed be the best soil for growth. Furthermore, this type soil\
    \ showed positive influence in forage bushes growth due to plants showed the best\
    \ growth, except Cocoite which the surviving rate was higher in Lithosol soil."
