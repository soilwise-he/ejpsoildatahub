  title: Fertigation Use In Agriculture And Biosorption Of Residual Nitrogen By Soil
    Microorganisms
  abstract: 'Present work deals with the possible use of fertigation

    in agriculture and its impact on the availability of mineral nitrogen

    (Nmin) in topsoil and subsoil horizons. The aim of the present study is

    to demonstrate the effect of the organic matter presence in fertigation

    on microbial transformation and availability of mineral nitrogen

    forms. The main investigation reason is the potential use of pretreated

    waste water, as a source of organic carbon (Corg) and residual

    nutrients (Nmin) for fertigation. Laboratory experiment has been

    conducted to demonstrate the effect of the arable land fertilization

    method on the Nmin availability in different depths of the soil with

    the usage of model experimental containers filled with soil from

    topsoil and podsoil horizons that were taken from the precise area.

    Tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa) has been chosen as a

    model plant. The water source protection zone Brezova nad Svitavou

    has been a research area where significant underground reservoirs of

    drinking water of the highest quality are located. From the second

    half of the last century local sources of drinking water show

    nitrogenous compounds increase that get here almost only from

    arable lands. Therefore, an attention of the following text focuses on

    the fate of mineral nitrogen in the complex plant-soil. Research

    results show that the fertigation application with Corg in a

    combination with mineral fertilizer can reduce the amount of Nmin

    leached from topsoil horizon of agricultural soils. In addition, some

    plants biomass production reduces may occur.'
