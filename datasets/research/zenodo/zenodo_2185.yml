  title: Effects of cow dung ash and calcium hydroxide on geotechnical properties
    of expansive and loose soil
  abstract: "The study is an investigation into the effects of CDA and Ca (OH)<sub>2\
    \ </sub>on geotechnical properties of expansive (Sample A) and loose soil (Sample\
    \ B). The experiments were designed to study the effects of adding CDA in various\
    \ percentages by weight (5%, 15% and 15%) of dry soil with 5% constant Ca (OH)<sub>2</sub>,\
    \ which produces pozzolanic reactions in soil samples. Sample A was collected\
    \ at Moniya, Ibadan, Sample B from The polytechnic, Ibadan and, cow dung was obtained\
    \ from a farm settlement at Ilora, Oyo State, the dung was air dried and then\
    \ calcined at 500 <sup>0</sup>C \u2013 600 <sup>0</sup>C, after which it was sieved\
    \ using 600\xB5m sieve. The samples were subjected to the following laboratory\
    \ tests; Natural moisture content, Particle (grain) size analysis, Atterberg limit\
    \ test, Compaction test, California bearing ratio (CBR) test. The NMC test shows\
    \ that sample A retains more water than sample B given by the values 26% and 6%\
    \ respectively, the particle size analysis results showed that sample A has highest\
    \ percentage of clay passing sieve no. 200 (75\xB5m) i.e. 62.86%, while sample\
    \ B has 7.27%, this indicates that sample A with high silt clay content are susceptible\
    \ to volume changes when wet. The liquid limit and plasticity index for sample\
    \ A is 49% and 28% respectively while sample B is a cohesionless soil. This shows\
    \ that sample A has high clay content and its load bearing capacity could be reduced\
    \ when wet. The AASHTO system classified sample A as A-7-6, and sample B as A-3.\
    \ This shows sample A is fair to poor while sample B is excellent to good. The\
    \ maximum dry densities ranged from 1.61mg/m3 to 1.87mg/m<sup>3</sup> and Optimum\
    \ moisture contents range from 19.2% to 16.36% respectively. The CBR value of\
    \ sample A as to the varying percentage are 2.07%, 10.62% (0% CDA &amp; 5% Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>)\
    \ , 12.69%, 16.77%, 31.41% while CBR value of sample B are thus: 32.7%, 27.06%\
    \ (0% CDA &amp; 5% Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), 12.09%, 16.2%, 16.74%. It was then observed\
    \ that CDA at 15% and Ca(OH)2 at 5% is the optimum for expansive soils while adding\
    \ CDA and Ca(OH)2 to loose soil will increase the OMC and thus reduce its engineering\
    \ properties."
