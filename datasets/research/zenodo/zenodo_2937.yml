  title: "Comparative Analysis Between the Results of Seismic Investigation and SPT\
    \ Test of a Tropical Soil Profile in the Bras\xEDlia Region - DF"
  abstract: "<em>In geotechnical engineering constructions, technical regulations\
    \ prescribe a minimum number of drilling tests to allow the definition of the\
    \ geotechnical profile of the site. However, even meeting this prerogative, obtaining\
    \ data through this type of investigation is punctual, which can lead to errors\
    \ in geological-geotechnical interpretations. In this context, this work aims\
    \ to evaluate the use of seismic refraction and MASW methods as complementary\
    \ tests to the SPT geotechnical investigation method, to validate the use of these\
    \ methodologies to interpret a tropical soil profile. The seismic and geotechnical\
    \ investigations were carried out in a vertical excavation located in the northwest\
    \ region of the city of Bras\xEDlia \u2013 DF, Brazil. The results showed a good\
    \ correlation between the seismic methods and the SPT regarding the identification\
    \ of soil layers present at the site. For both seismic methods, it was possible\
    \ to verify an increase in the velocities of the VS and VP waves with increasing\
    \ depth, which allowed the evaluation of the interfaces between the soil layers\
    \ in the first 15 meters. It can also be verified that both methodologies have\
    \ the potential to identify layers of porous soils with collapsible behaviour.</em>"
