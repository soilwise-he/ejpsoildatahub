  title: Biotransformation Of Artemisinin By Using A Novel Soil Isolated Microorganism
  abstract: 'Artemisinin is a potential antimalarial drug effective

    against the multidrug resistant forms of Malarial Parasites. The

    current production of artemisinin is insufficient to meet the global

    demand. In the present study microbial biotransformation of

    arteannuin B, a biogenetic precursor of artemisinin to the later has

    been investigated. Screening studies carried out on several soil borne

    microorganisms have yielded one novel species with the

    bioconversion ability. Crude cell free extract of 72h old culture of the

    isolate had shown the bioconversion activity. On incubation with the

    substrate arteannuin B, crude cell free extract of the isolate had

    shown a bioconversion of 18.54% to artemisinin on molar basis with

    a specific activity of 0.18 units/mg.'
