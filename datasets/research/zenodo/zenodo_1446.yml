  title: Triaxial Test on Soil - Important Insights for Stress-Controlled and Strain-Controlled
    Test
  abstract: Triaxial testing of soils is carried out under various loading methods
    to simulate field loading conditions or to analyze the fundamental behavior of
    soil material. The objective of this paper is to review the triaxial testing of
    soil under stress control and strain control loading mode. The triaxial shear
    test simulates 3- dimensional stress condition including pore water pressure is
    an identical condition that occurred in situ on soil specimen; this is the advantage
    of the triaxial test over other shear tests on soil. The triaxial test apparatus,
    procedures, and sample preparation is explained in brief. The analysis of results
    over drainage conditions and shearing phase is incorporated. The modern triaxial
    tests contain thorough control over test setup and accurate results are determined
    which makes the triaxial test versatile and used for research in geotechnical
    engineering. The different loading modes are used to simulate the field stress,
    strain condition and to understand the response of the soil by many researchers.
    They analyzed test results of the same soil specimen tested under both modes of
    loading (i.e., stress and strain-controlled) will focus on parameters like progressive
    failure, peak strength, and residual strength behavior of soil. Monotonic loading
    under strain control test gives post-peak behavior of soil necessary to understand
    the progressive failure. Similarly, the stress-controlled test is useful to study
    timedependent deformation in clay. The comprehensive study presented here for
    the stress and strain control triaxial test and finally, it focuses on recent
    advancement of technologies in respective loading modes.
