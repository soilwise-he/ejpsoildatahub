  title: THE IMPORTANCE OF MOBILE PHOSPHATES IN THE SOIL AND THE EFFECT OF NITROGEN
    FERTILIZERS ON INCREASING THE MOBILITY OF PHOSPHORUS UNDER DIFFERENT AVAILABILITY
    OF TYPICAL SEROZEMS
  abstract: <em>The article presents data on the study of the content of mobile phosphorus
    in the soil, extracted by ammonium carbonate, dated in the early periods of the
    growing season, the beginning of the year, April-May, and the later months in
    autumn. The researchers found that the use of nitrogen fertilizers (urea), under
    cotton and prickly artichoke, especially ammonium sulfate in relation to ammonium
    nitrate and calcium nitrite, contribute to an increase in mobile phosphates in
    the soil due to the mobilization of the first groups of phosphates. Accordingly,
    the mobile phosphates extracted by ammonium carbonate solution, when ammonium
    sulfate and urea are added to the plants we study, increase with this nutrition
    element to a greater extent on medium-rich than on low-rich soil. Thus, the use
    of urea and especially ammonium sulfate, in comparison with other forms of nitrogen
    fertilizers, especially in comparison with low-availability phosphorus in the
    soil, enhances the growth, development and productivity of cotton and prickly
    artichoke, as well as biologically active substances (rutin, luteolin) in their
    tissues</em>
