  title: A comparison of the selected properties of macrostructure and density of
    wood of scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing on various mine soil substrates
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted on the external spoil heap of the
    &lsquo;Piaseczno&rsquo; Sulphur Mine (southern Poland). This paper is aimed to
    compare the selected properties of macrostructure and density of wood of Scots
    pine trees planted onto the external spoil heap of the mine, in the scope of forest
    reclamation, depending on the soil substrate and employed reclamation treatments.
    The annual rings of pine trees on the Quaternary sands and Tertiary Krakowieckie
    clays (S&amp;C) were significantly wider than those of the individuals on the
    Quaternary loose sands (S) and Quaternary sands and Tertiary clays after an intense
    initial fertilization (F). However, the share of latewood zone and density of
    wood of the pine trees growing on the substrate F were significantly greater in
    comparison to those of substrates S and S&amp;C.&lt;/p&gt;'
