  title: ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF WESTERN TYANSHAN MOUNTAIN
    SOIL.
  abstract: Today, as a result of global climate change, the loss of one of the main
    indicators of soil fertility-humus, namely, dehumification, leads to an acceleration
    of processes such as a decrease in fertility, erosion, and desertification. According
    to the FAO international organization, about 33% of the world's soils are subject
    to degradation to varying degrees. The main environmental problem of nature management
    and the effectiveness of biological resources is soil degradation. Along with
    other soils of the continent, soils of Uzbekistan are also subject to degradation.
