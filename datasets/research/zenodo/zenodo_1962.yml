  title: Soil mesofauna (Acarina and Collembola) along transects through shelterbelts
    of different age and adjacent fields
  abstract: "The communities of soil mesofauna were studied in the year 2004 along\
    \ three transects crossed shelterbelts of different age (6,11 and 170 years old)\
    \ and adjacent wheat fields at a distance of 0.5, 15 and 50 m. Studies were carried\n\
    out in the Gen. D. Ch\u0142apowski Landscape Park near Turew, Western Poland (16045'E,\
    \ 52001'W). The age of shelterbelts vegetation affected soil mesofauna of adjacent\
    \ fields in a diverse way. The mean density of mites amounts 7.4 \xD7 103ind.\
    \ m\u20132 and 2.6 \xD7 103 ind. m\u20132 respectively for the shelterbelts and\
    \ fields. Densities of Acarina communities\nwere affected not only by the presence\
    \ of a shelterbelt (P = 0.000) but also its age (P = 0.02) and the distance from\
    \ it (P = 0.000), and these effects were similar in spring and autumn (P = 0.08).\
    \ The mean density of springtail noted in shelterbelts of different age was 2.0\
    \ \xD7 103 ind. m\u20132 and in the field sites 2.2 \xD7 103 ind. m\u20132. Although\
    \ the effect\nof the shelterbelts' age on the density of Collembola was not found\
    \ (P = 0.3), the densities were different in shelterbelts and in adjacent fields\
    \ (P = 0.006) but statistical significance was found only between spring and autumn\
    \ (P = 0.000). The distance from the shelterbelt influenced (though less intensely)\
    \ the density of Collembola on adjacent field (P = 0.01). Eighteen species of\
    \ Collembola were found in studied shelterbelts and fields. Isotoma notabilis\
    \ Sch\xE4ff. usually dominated in shelterbelts. Its contribution to abundance\
    \ of communities varied depending on the age of\nshelterbelts (in 6 years old\
    \ shelterbelt it constituted as many as 71% of the whole community).\n In 11 years\
    \ old shelterbelt Schoetella ununguiculata (Tullb.), was more common than Isotoma\
    \ notabilis Sch\xE4ff. and in the 170 years old shelterbelt the dominant species\
    \ was Onychiurus armatus (Tullb.). Friesea mirabilis (Tullb.), Proisotoma\nminuta\
    \ (Tullb.), Isotoma notabilis or Onychiurus armatus dominated in adjacent fields\
    \ though their contribution was depended on shelterbelt's age and on the distance\
    \ from it."
