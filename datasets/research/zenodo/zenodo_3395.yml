  title: Effect Of Different Fertilization Methods On Soil Biological Indexes
  abstract: 'Fertilization plays an important role in crop growth and soil improvement.
    This study was conducted to determine the best fertilization system for wheat
    production. Experiments were arranged in a complete block design with three replications
    in two years. Main plots consisted of six methods of fertilization including (N1):
    farmyard manure; (N2): compost; (N3): chemical fertilizers; (N4): farmyard manure
    + compost; (N5): farmyard manure + compost + chemical fertilizers and (N6): control
    were arranged in sub plots. The addition of compost or farm yard manure significantly
    increased the soil microbial biomass carbon in comparison to the chemical fertilizer.
    The dehydrogenase, phosphatase and urease activities in the N3 treatment were
    significantly lower than in the farm yard manure and compost treatments.'
