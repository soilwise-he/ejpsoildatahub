  title: Geotechnical Properties of Soil in the Flood-Prone Okpe Town, Isoko North
    Local Government Area, Delta State
  abstract: "<em>This research work focused on assessing the geotechnical properties\
    \ of soil in Okpe Community. Soil samples were collected from five different locations\
    \ within the community, and at each location three sampling depths (0.3 m, 4 m\
    \ and 8m) were adopted. Four geotechnical analyses (consistency limits, specific\
    \ gravity, optimal moisture content \u201COMC\u201D and maximum dry density \u201C\
    MDD\u201D) were carried out on the 15 soil samples, in accordance with ASTM approved\
    \ guidelines. The consistency limits test results indicated that the topsoil (0.3\
    \ m), 4 m and 8 m soils liquid limit values varied from 52.38% -63.42%, 29.07%\
    \ - 69.69% and 19.83% -28.50%, respectively. Also, the plastic limits values for\
    \ the topsoil, 4 m and 8 m soils ranged from 20.70% - 26.08%, 16.60% - 32.34%,\
    \ and 5.74% - 19.73%, respectively. The topsoil, 4 m and 8 m soil samples specific\
    \ gravity values varied from 2.66 \u2013 2.69, 2.64 \u2013 2.67, and 2.62-2.64n\
    \ respectively. Likewise, MDD results depicted that its values for the soil samples\
    \ collected at the topsoil, 4 m and 8 m soil depths ranged from 1.53 g/cm<sup>3</sup>-1.59\
    \ g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 1.59 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>-1.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and 1.68 g/cm<sup>3</sup>-1.75\
    \ g/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Similarly, the results revealed that the OMC\
    \ of the soil samples collected at the topsoil, 4 m and 8 m depths varied from\
    \ 15.3% to 16.3%, 14.8% -17.9%, and 13.2% -14.2%, respectively. The findings will\
    \ contribute to informed decision-making for infrastructure development in flood-prone\
    \ areas.</em>"
