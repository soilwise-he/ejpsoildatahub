  title: Soil, Driving Speed and Driving Intensity Affect Fuel Consumption of Forwarders
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Fuel consumption is one of the key parameters in mechanised
    forest operations, particularly on lower bearing capacity soils, as wheel chains
    or bogie tracks can have a strong effect on it. This study aims to analyse the
    fuel consumption of several individual wheeled cut-to-length forwarder set-ups
    with different types of bogie tracks on peatland using automatic recording of
    data bus information. Two types of forwarders, 8-wheeled and 10-wheeled, and three
    types of tracks were tested on peatland in Eastern Finland. A mixed-model approach
    is the basis to study the fuel consumption as a function of the soil bearing capacity,
    the number of passes of the machine on the same soil, the section (curve or straight)
    and other variables related to the machine performance and set-up, for a total
    of N=27,928 fuel observations on three machines in 33 plots (trail segments).
    The model results in an R2=0.78; the number of passes increases the fuel consumption
    significantly, while the soil bearing capacity did not affect the fuel consumption.&lt;br&gt;

    There are, however, important differences between the machines performance, which
    are addressed in the model. By contributing to the knowledge on the connection
    between operational conditions and fuel consumption, the study can contribute
    to the aim towards a sustainable forest operation through minimizing negative
    environmental impacts and providing the necessary tools for further research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;'
