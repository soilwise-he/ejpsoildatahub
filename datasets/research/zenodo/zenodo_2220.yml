  title: Tree species composition rather than biodiversity impacts forest soil organic
    carbon of Three Gorges, southwestern China
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Forest soil represents an important resource for mitigating\
    \ the climate change. Besides, plant composition and diversity and their roles\
    \ in ecosystem functioning are becoming a central issue in forest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;soil\
    \ organic carbon &lt;/p&gt;(SOC) research. The primary objective of this research\
    \ is to investigate the effects of tree species diversity and composition on potential\
    \ of C sequestration of forest soil in Three Gorges area and provide basic information\
    \ to future research on climate change. Two dominant forest ecosystems were selected:\
    \ mixed conifer-broadleaf forest (F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and evergreen broadleaf\
    \ forest (F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). Then study transects were established and\
    \ investigated. Soil samples were collected and determined for bulk density, SOC\
    \ concentration and stock, nitrogen (N) concentration and C:N ratio. The results\
    \ showed that the statistical differences of SOC concentrations and stocks between\
    \ F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; were caused by tree\
    \ species composition rather than the tree species diversity. And the most significant\
    \ differences were found in the first two soil horizons (0\u201315 cm and 15\u2013\
    30 cm). The average C:N values of four different horizons in F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ were decreased with increasing soil depth as well as F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.\
    \ Not only SOC concentrations but also stocks of the two studied forests were\
    \ decreased with increasing soil depth. However, F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; showed\
    \ a larger capacity to store SOC with an average stock of 183.50 t/ha than that\
    \ of F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; (100.44 t/ha) in study area. Thus, forest which\
    \ is composed of conifer and evergreen broadleaf tree species may be the best\
    \ choice for local afforestation and reforestation aimed at alleviating climate\
    \ change in Three Gorges region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
