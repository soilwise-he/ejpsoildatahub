  title: Mapping the Resilient Modulus of a Soil at Any Stress State Using Results
    of two RLT Tests
  abstract: 'This upload contains input data used in a study with a title "mapping
    the resilient modulus of a soil at any stress state using results of two RLT tests"
    and the results. Data description: 1. Input MR Data: Input data extracted from
    the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database and used for model development.
    2. Sample Group: Sample group after grouping the data based on the soil sample
    on which the tests are done. 3. MR Data after Preprocessing: The final form of
    the data after data preprocessing was done. 4. MR Data after Preprocessing (After
    Excluding State Code 20): The final form of the data after data preprocessing
    was done and after excluding data from state code 20 (Kansas). 5. MR Data after
    Preprocessing (For State Code 20): The final form of the data after data preprocessing
    was done, for state code 20 (Kansas). 6. Hyper-parameter Tuning using Optuna (XGBoost):
    Hyper-parameter tuning results obtained from the Optuna library for XGBoost. 7.
    Hyper-parameter Tuning using Optuna (Neural Network): Hyper-parameter tuning results
    obtained from the Optuna library for neural network. 8. Final Model (XGBoost):
    Model developed using XGBoost (saved as a .sav file). 9. Final Model (Neural Network):
    Model developed using neural network (saved as a .sav file). 10. Measured and
    Predicted MR on Testing Dataset (XGBoost): Table of measured MR values and MR
    values predicted using the XGBoost model for the testing dataset. 11. Measured
    and Predicted MR on Testing Dataset (Neural Network): Table of measured MR values
    and MR values predicted using the neural network model for the testing dataset.
    12. Measured and Predicted MR on New Dataset (XGBoost): Table of measured MR values
    and MR values predicted using the XGBoost model for a data from a new location.
    13. Measured and Predicted MR on New Dataset (Neural Network): Table of measured
    MR values and MR values predicted using the neural network model for a data from
    a new location.'
