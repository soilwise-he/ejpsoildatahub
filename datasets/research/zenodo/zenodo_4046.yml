  title: 'PARTICIPATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF WATER AND SOIL CONSERVATION POLICY IN
    SOUTH-EAST OF TUNISIA OUM ZESSAR WATERSSHED: MEDENINE'
  abstract: Sustainable development of land use is determined by changes of the regional
    supply of Land Use Functions (LUFs) and the demand of future societal land use
    claims. LUFs are based on the ecosystem services concept, but more adapted to
    human land use. In this paper, we assessed 3 land-use scenarios towards sustainable
    development in south est tunisia in order to understand their impacts on LUFs
    and land use claims. For this, we extended an analytical framework designed to
    confront LUFs with land use claims identified in multi-level stakeholder strategies
    in a participatory manner.
