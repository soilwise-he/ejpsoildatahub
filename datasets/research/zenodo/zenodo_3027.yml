  title: Comparative Effects Of Soil Amendments On Phosphorus Use And Agronomic Efficiencies
    Of Two Maize Hybrids In Acidic Soils Of Molo County, Kenya
  abstract: The deficiency of P and the shortened growing seasons due to climate change
    are identified constraints in the production of commonly grown long maturing maize
    hybrid (H614) in the acid soils of Molo County, Kenya. The current study therefore
    investigated (i) the effect of soil amendments; lime (L), minjingu phosphate rock
    (MPR) and manure (FYM) on soil available P and its uptake, phosphorus use efficiency
    (PUE) and maize grain yield of long (H614) and short (H513) maturing maize hybrids
    and (ii) the relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) of MPR. Field experiments were
    set up at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Molo during the long rain
    seasons of 2009 and 2010. A randomized complete block design with a 23 factorial
    arrangement was used for the first objective. The factors, each at two levels,
    were L (0 and 3 t ha-1), MPR (0 and 60 kg P ha-1) and FYM (0 and 5 t ha-1) giving
    a total of eight treatments; C (control), L, MPR, FYM, L+MPR, L+FYM, FYM+MPR and
    L+FYM+MPR. The relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) of MPR was determined in a
    parallel experiment laid out in randomized complete block design with a split
    plot arrangement and replicated thrice. Maize hybrid H513 and H614 were the test
    crops in both experiments and constituted the main plots. The split plots were
    control (0 kg P ha-1), triple super phosphate (60 kg P ha-1) and MPR (60 kg P
    ha-1). Soil available P and its uptake, PUE, RAE and maize yields were the parameters
    measured. The application of soil amendments increased soil available P and its
    uptake, PUE and maize yields over the control for both maize hybrids. Highest
    values of the measured parameters were recorded in the L+FYM+MPR treatment and
    for maize hybrid H614. The two year mean values of relative agronomic efficiency
    RAE (%) of MPR were 60 (H513) and 66.7 (H614), and significantly higher for the
    maize hybrid H614. The combined application of soil amendments could thus improve
    maize productivity and is recommended for the acid soils of Molo County. The maize
    hybrid H513 though with lower yields, matured faster than H614 and would thus
    come in handy as an adaptation strategy in the face of climate change and variability.
    Moreover, it has a low P requirement and a short growth cycle thus making it an
    ideal variety, economically, for smallholder farmers.
