  title: Screening and Isolation of halophilic plant growth promoting bacteria from
    soil, Maharashtra.
  abstract: Halophilic bacteria are those bacteria that can survive and grow in presence
    of higher salt concentration. Sodic and saline soils are the soils that harbors
    halophilic bacteria. Plant growth promoting bacteria are those bacteria that can
    enhance plant growth which in turn helps in increasing productivity. In the current
    study two traits of plant growth promoting traits were studied namely phosphate
    solubilization and indole acetic acid production.A total number of 121 isolates
    were isolated and were studied for their plant growth promoting characters. All
    isolates were studied for their salt tolerance up to 10%. Among all isolates 80
    were found to be phosphate solubilizes and 70 were able to synthesize indole acetic
    acid. These bacteria can be further used for production of biofertilizer which
    will be beneficial for cultivation in sodic and saline soil.
