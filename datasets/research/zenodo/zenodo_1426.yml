  title: Current Methods, Common Practices, and Perspectives in Tracking and Monitoring
    Bioinoculants in Soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms promised to lead the bio-based revolution for a more
    sustainable agriculture. Beneficial microorganisms could be a valid alternative
    to the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. However, the increasing use
    of microbial inoculants is also raising several questions about their efficacy
    and their effects on the autochthonous soil microorganisms. There are two major
    issues on the application of bioinoculants to soil: (i) their detection in soil,
    and the analysis of their persistence and fate; (ii) the monitoring of the impact
    of the introduced bioinoculant on native soil microbial communities. This review
    explores the strategies and methods that can be applied to the detection of microbial
    inoculants and to soil monitoring. The discussion includes a comprehensive critical
    assessment of the available tools, based on morpho-phenological, molecular, and
    microscopic analyses. The prospects for future development of protocols for regulatory
    or commercial purposes are also discussed, underlining the need for a multi-method
    (polyphasic) approach to ensure the necessary level of discrimination required
    to track and monitor bioinoculants in soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
