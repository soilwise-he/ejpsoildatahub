  title: Soil geomorphic unit and ecological site group maps for the rangelands of
    the Upper Colorado River Basin region
  abstract: 'This repository includes map of new soil geomorphic units and associated
    ecological site groups for portions of the Upper Colorado River watershed. This
    maps were created to serve as monitoring and management units for land managers
    to use in evaluating land condition. They were created as the spatial data supporting
    more detailed descriptions that describe both the potential vegetation if areas
    are in good condition, or possible alternative ecological states that are likely
    in different scenarios. These data are preliminary or provisional and are subject
    to revision. They are being provided to meet the need for timely best science.
    The data have not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
    and are provided on the condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S. Government
    shall be held liable for any damages resulting from the authorized or unauthorized
    use of the data. The creation and interpretation of these data are documented
    in the following article. The descriptions of these units will also be eventually
    posted on the Ecosystem Dynamics Interpretive Tool (https://edit.jornada.nmsu.edu/)
    or in other reports (updates will be posted here on Zenodo). Ultimately, these
    data will also be release in an official USGS repository, which will serve as
    the official copy. A link to that final release will be posted here. Nauman, T.W.,

    Accuracy of maps! We used a randomly withheld 20% of the soils data training locations
    to validate the maps made here. Maps were created using a random forest classification
    model using digital soil mapping methods (details in publication). Overall accuracy
    was 57% with agreement rising to 74% and 82% if the 2nd and 3rd most probable
    predicted classes were considered. A validation confusion matrix is included for
    more details on each class. Files and Brief Descriptions: "Clim_zones": These
    files include a geotif raster and associated GIS files showing spatial distribution
    of climate zones. Files include a pre-joined table of class names that will open
    in ArcGIS fully labeled, or in other GIS software by class value (have to use
    dbf to look up names). These climate zones were used in combination with the soil
    geomorphic units to create the Ecological Site Groups ESGs. They utilize a common
    global aridity index map (https://cgiarcsi.community/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database/)
    along with a map of the average high temperature for the hottest month (https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html,
    BIO5). "sgu_1stClass": These files include a geotif raster and associated GIS
    files showing spatial distribution of Soil Geomorphic Units (SGUs). This raster
    indicates the most likely predicted class in the model for every pixel. Files
    include a pre-joined table of class names that will open in ArcGIS fully labeled,
    or in other GIS software by class value (have to use dbf to look up names). "sgu_2ndClass":
    These files include a geotif raster and associated GIS files showing spatial distribution
    of SGUs. This raster indicates the second most likely predicted class in the model
    for every pixel. Files include a pre-joined table of class names that will open
    in ArcGIS fully labeled, or in other GIS software by class value (have to use
    dbf to look up names). "sgu_3rdClass": These files include a geotif raster and
    associated GIS files showing spatial distribution of SGUs. This raster indicates
    the third most likely predicted class in the model for every pixel. Files include
    a pre-joined table of class names that will open in ArcGIS fully labeled, or in
    other GIS software by class value (have to use dbf to look up names). "UCRB_SGUs_probmax":
    These files include a geotif raster and associated GIS files showing spatial distribution
    of prediction probabilities associated with the most probable SGU class for each
    pixel. This provides a relative understanding of how uncertain the model was in
    each pixel prediction. "UCRB_SGUs_ShanEntropy" These files include a geotif raster
    and associated GIS files showing spatial distribution of Shannon''s Entropy calculated
    based on the modeled probabilities of all possible SGU classes in each pixel.
    Higher values indicate more dispersion of probability across classes (more uncertainty
    in prediction) that can be interpreted in relative terms. "ESGs_final": These
    files include a geotif raster and associated GIS files showing spatial distribution
    of Ecological Site Groups (SGUs). This raster combines the SGU map with the climate
    zones based on an optimization of both reference community vegetation production
    and potential states from state and transition models linked to each group (See
    publication for details). Files include a pre-joined table of class names that
    will open in ArcGIS fully labeled, or in other GIS software by class value (have
    to use dbf to look up names). "UCRB_SGU_validation_confusion_matrix.xls" Excel
    worksheet with table comparing predicted classes to observed classes at withheld
    soil classification locations. This sheet provides class-wise User Accuracy (number
    of correct predictions out of total location predicted to be a certain class)
    and Producer Accuracy (number of correct predictions out of the total validation
    locations determined to be a given class) along with overall accuracy.'
