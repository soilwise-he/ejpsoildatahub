  title: Contribution Of Soil Microorganisms In Antibiotic Production
  abstract: "<em>Antibiotics are the metabolic by products of complex biosynthetic\
    \ pathways in the microorganisms. They are often touted as one of the most important\
    \ discoveries of the modern medicine. It contributes to save millions of lives\
    \ and to control the majority of bacterial infectious diseases. Intensive research\
    \ on antibiotics has been carried out globally for approximately thirty five to\
    \ forty years whereas the search for new antibiotics still continues in a rather\
    \ over looked hunting grounds. Recent studies dealt with the search for new antibiotics\
    \ and their interest stemmed in the soil microbials due to its large biodiversity\
    \ in search for new useful compounds. There are also reports presented by different\
    \ researchers on the secondary metabolites potential of different Bacterial, Fungal\
    \ and Antinomycetes species. This article compiles the historical background,\
    \ factors, needs, source and future prospects of secondary metabolites and the\
    \ role and bioactivity of microorganisms\u2019 in habitat in soil for the development\
    \ of new antibiotics as a life saving agents for everyone. To determine microbial\
    \ diversity within the soil is crucial in the past but with the new methods it\
    \ is now possible to detect both culturable and un-culturable microbial species.\
    \ It is a brief overview of the antibiotic development through years and its emergence.\
    \ Thus in this review contribution of soil microbials for the development of novel\
    \ antibiotics and designing more effective preventive measures in the future have\
    \ been discussed.</em>\n\n<strong>Keywords: </strong><em>Antibiotics, Soil microbials,\
    \ Life saving agents.</em>"
