  title: BACTERIAL DENSITY IN CASSAVA EFFLUENT-CONTAMINATED SOIL AT UMUAKU, ULI COMMUNITY,
    ANAMBRA STATE
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> A good quality soil is characterized by adequate
    nutrients as a result of abundant nutrients cycling bacteria. Most soil in Nigeria
    has been subjected to different kinds of pollutants resulting from anthropogenic
    activities which have become a major threatening factor to the quality of soil.
    This study was undertaken to determine the bacterial density in cassava effluent
    contaminated soil at Umuaku, Uli community, Anambra State. A total of 30 composite
    soil samples were aseptically collected from cassava effluent disposal site using
    a sterile soil auger. The samples were analyzed for total heterotrophic bacterial
    count (THBC) and nitrifying bacterial count (NBC) using standard plate technique.
    The predominant bacterial isolates that aided nutrients cycling were appropriately
    characterized, and their diversities in both impacted and non-impacted soil samples
    were enumerated. Also, the bacterial isolates were characterized based on morphology,
    microscopy, and biochemical characteristics. There was a significant reduction
    in the THBC and NBC in the impacted soil, and Gram negative rods such as <em>Enterobacter,
    Burkholderia,</em> and <em>Bacillus</em> species (Gram positive) were mostly isolated.
    The study has revealed that cassava effluent affects microbial distribution in
    the soil. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Bacteria, Waste, Cassava Effluent. <strong>Title:</strong>
