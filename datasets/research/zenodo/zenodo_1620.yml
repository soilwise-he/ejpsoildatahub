  title: Experiment plan for the organic soil samples from 50 forest fire sites in
    Sweden
  abstract: This is a draft protocol explaining the methodology step by step including
    the implemented experiment at each stage, the amount of solution treated in each
    experiment and the type of data produced. This protocol will be very useful since
    the experiments are going to be repeated over and over to cover all the 100 sites
    that the samples were collected from. The protocol is written by Hani Younes and
    revised by Martin Berggren
