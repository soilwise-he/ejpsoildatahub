  title: "Determination of Some Major Physical Characteristics of the Soil at the\
    \ Jean Lorougnon Gu\xE9d\xE9 Daloa University School-Field and its Suitability\
    \ for Cultivation"
  abstract: "The study was conducted from mid-May 2022<br> to June 2022 during the\
    \ rainy season on the<br> experimental plot of the University Jean Lorougnon<br>\
    \ Gu\xE9d\xE9 of Daloa (C\xF4te d'Ivoire). The objective was to<br> provide good\
    \ scientific information on the morphology<br> and the level of physical fertility\
    \ of the school-field soil<br> for a good agricultural activity. In the field\
    \ school area,<br> after having determined the azimuthal direction and<br> identified\
    \ the dominant vegetation, soil pits (100 x 80 x<br> 120 cm) were opened according\
    \ to the toposequence, at<br> the preferential positions of plateau, slope, mid-slope\
    \ and<br> lowland, then observed and described. After the soil<br> profiles were\
    \ described, soil samples were taken from the<br> horizons (surface A and underlying\
    \ B) at each level of<br> the toposequence to determine the physical parameters.<br>\
    \ An analysis of variance of the data was performed with<br> SAS 9.4 software\
    \ and the means were separated using<br> the Newman-Keuls test at the 5% probability\
    \ level. The<br> results showed that at the morpho pedological level, the<br>\
    \ field-school soil had a thick superficial A horizon (22 to<br> 32 cm) and a\
    \ deep underlying B horizon (98 to 88 cm)<br> from the plateau to the lowlands.\
    \ A plinthitic ferralsol, a<br> plinthitc leptosol, a pseudogleyic ferralsol and\
    \ a fluviosol<br> were respectively determined along the toposequence. At<br>\
    \ the physical level, a good particle size fraction was<br> recorded giving a\
    \ silty-sandy texture of the field-school<br> soil. The average bulk density (1.35\
    \ to 1.50 g/cm3) as well<br> as the useful reserve (&gt;100mm) were satisfactory\
    \ for<br> good soil water circulation. In terms of cultivation<br> suitability,\
    \ the field-school soil did not present any major<br> constraints to farming.\
    \ In conclusion, the champ-\xE9cole<br> soil presented morpho pedological characteristics\
    \ and<br> physical properties favorable to a good agricultural<br> activity. However,\
    \ it was noted that the downstream soils<br> (mid-slope and lowland) would be\
    \ more favorable to<br> food and vegetable crops while the upstream soils<br>\
    \ (plateau and slope) would be suitable for perennial<br> crops."
