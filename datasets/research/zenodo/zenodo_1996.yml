  title: Studies on the Persistence and Degradation of Endosulfan in the Soil Ecosystem
    of Tropical Climate
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> The meteorological, adaphic, physical, physico-chemical\
    \ and chemical properties have been observed at the experimental site. A detailed\
    \ study of sub-soil inhabiting micro and macroarthropod population was made with\
    \ the application of Endosulfan at lower and higher doses as well as at different\
    \ time intervals with definite distances (i.e.1'.0ft;1.6';2.0';2.6';3.0'; 3.6'\
    \ ; 4.0' ;5.0';6.0';8.0';10.0';12.0'; and 13.0' ft;) and different time periods\
    \ from the time of toxicant application, different time intervals (48 hrs;6th;9th;15th;21st;30th;45th;60th;\
    \ and 290 days) recorded. Maximum population of microarthropod fauna was found\
    \ after 45 days at 4.0ft. distance while least population after 60 days at 6.0ft.\
    \ distance was recorded. A significant increase of this population was found after\
    \ 290 days at 8.0ft. distance. A three (3) fold increase was found after 290 days\
    \ at 8.0ft. Further variation in the population in relation to time and distance\
    \ are discussed. Among the microarthropod fauna the highest population was that\
    \ of <em>Acarina</em> found at 15 cm. core depth. A total absence of collembolan\
    \ population was found at several times clearly showing high susceptibility of\
    \ the population to 'Endosulfan'. A maximum of coleopteron population was found\
    \ on 6th day at 1.6 ft. and a total elimination of population at lower dose of\
    \ 'Endosulfan was noticed at every point of study. The <em>Myriapoda</em> population\
    \ was maximum at 8.0 ft. distance 290 days after the treatment; at other points\
    \ of observation Myriapoda population was insignificant in the soil. <strong>References</strong>\
