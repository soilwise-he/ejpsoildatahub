  title: Comparative Assessment of Soil Quality in Neemuch District of Madhya Pradesh
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> Soil health management for sustaining crop
    productivity is a major challenge of recent years to meet the food demand and
    nutritional security of increasing population. Nutrient are chemical elements
    that are essential for the growth of plants as well as fertility of soil. The
    beneficial role of various elements added to soil for the improvement of plant
    growth has been known in agriculture for more than 2000 years. For effective management
    of soil quality, assessment of soil health and periodic monitoring is foremost
    important step. The mineral composition of various plants growing in soil cannot
    always be used as criterion for establishing the essential or non-essential nature
    of an element. The plant nutrients are divided into macronutrients and micronutrients.
    The essentiality of micro nutrient is proved long before the role in crop production
    was recognized. In this connection, the soil quality status of Neemuch district
    of Madhya Pradesh was assessed. The developed soil quality assessment protocol
    is very simple and can be easily adoptable. Periodic monitoring and assessment
    of (at least once in five years) of soil quality status can be very useful for
    enhancing crop productivity and sustaining soil health of the region. <strong>Keywords:</strong>
