  title: The Effects Of Four Organic Cropping Sequences On Soil Phosphorous Cycling
    And Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi
  abstract: 'Organic farmers across Saskatchewan face soil<br>

    phosphorus (P) shortages. Due to the restriction on inputs in organic<br>

    systems, farmers rely on crop rotation and naturally-occurring<br>

    arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for plant P supply. Crop rotation<br>

    is important for disease, pest, and weed management. Crops that are<br>

    not colonized by AMF (non-mycorrhizal) can decrease colonization<br>

    of a following crop. An experiment was performed to quantify soil P<br>

    cycling in four cropping sequences under organic management and<br>

    determine if mustard (non-mycorrhizal) was delaying the<br>

    colonization of subsequent wheat. Soils from the four cropping<br>

    sequences were measured for inorganic soil P (Pi), AMF spore<br>

    density (SD), phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA, for AMF<br>

    biomarker counts), and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALPase,<br>

    related to AMF metabolic activity). Plants were measured for AMF<br>

    colonization and P content and uptake of above-ground biomass. A<br>

    lack of difference in AMF activity indicated that mustard was not<br>

    depressing colonization. Instead, AMF colonization was largely<br>

    determined by crop type and crop rotation.'
