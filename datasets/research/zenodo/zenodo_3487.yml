  title: Restoration Of Biological Function Of Degraded Soil Via Chemical Method
  abstract: 'The studies concerned an effect of six variants of ion

    exchange substrate (nutrient carriers with a different potential impact

    on pH of soil solution) on vegetation of orchard grass during two

    different periods (42 and 84 days). In the pot experiment plants were

    grown on sand (model of degraded soil) and six mixtures of sand and

    2% (v/v) additions of particular variants of ion exchange substrate

    (with pH ranged from 5.5 to 8.0). The study results showed that the

    addition of the substrate at pH=6.5 caused the highest increase in

    plant yield after shorter vegetation period whereas the addition of the

    substrate at pH=5.5 increased dry stem and root biomass of orchard

    grass after longer vegetation period. Thus, the ion exchange substrate

    at pH=6.5 can be recommended for restoration of exhausted soils

    when shorter vegetation period is planned; the ion exchange substrate

    at pH=5.5 can be used for the same purpose when longer periods of

    vegetative growth are considered.'
