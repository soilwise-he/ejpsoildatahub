  title: Seasonal Dynamics of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi, Glomalin and Soil Properties
    in Agroecosystems of Nanded District
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;To understand the ecological significance of arbuscular mycorrhizal
    fungal AMF associations in agroecosysytem, the host specific and seasonal dynamics
    of AMF and glomalin related soil protein GRSP was investigated in agricultural
    fields of Nanded, Maharashtra State. Soil samples were collected from the rhizosphere
    of eight crop plants Glycine max L. Merr., Saccharum officinarum L., Zea mays
    L., Cajanas cajan L. Millsp., Gossypium arboreum L., Triticum aestivum L., Sorghum
    vulgare Pers. and Cicer arietinum L. in winter, summer and monsoon seasons respectively.
    Arbuscular mycorrhizal root infection and spore density of AMF peaked in monsoon
    and winter.The mean contents of total glomalin related soil proteins T GRSP reached
    maximal values in summer. Spore density was highest in Zea mays L. Easily extractable
    glomalin related EE GRSP and T GRSP fractions were the highest in the rhizosphere
    of Cicer arietinum L. and Sorghum vulgare Pers. AMF root colonization and spore
    density was negatively correlated with K P 0.05 P 0.01 . T GRSP fraction was positively
    correlated with edaphic factors rhizosphere temperature, K and Fe content of soil
    and negatively correlated with soil moisture P 0.01 , AMF root colonization P
    0.05 and spore density P 0.01 . Therefore, it can be inferred that the response
    of AMF varies with different crop plants and hence it reflects the variations
    in glomalin, and suggest that glomalin is produced in environmental stress on
    the basis of its relationship with soil physicochemical parameters, and can be
    implicated for evaluating soil quality in agricultural fields. Ujwala Sheshrao
