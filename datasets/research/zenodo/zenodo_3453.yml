  title: Prospect of Phosphate Solubilizing Microorganisms for Acid Sulphate Soil
    Bioremediation
  abstract: <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <br> Acid sulphate soil (ASS) have a large distribution
    in the world (107-108 ha) and in<br> Indonesia (6.71x 106 ha). ASS characterized
    by high concentration of Al3+ and Fe2+ ions<br> and also high acidity resulted
    pyrite oxidation. The presence of these ions and lowering<br> of pH causes some
    problem such as loss of agricultural productivity and environmental<br> damage.
    To improve agriculture productivity, ASS requires remediation to minimize of<br>
    Fe and Al activity and to increase soil pH. One of remediation techniques is<br>
    microorganisms use (bioremediation). Bioremediation is a process that using living<br>
    organisms to decrease toxic elements. Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSM)<br>
    remediate metal-contaminant in soil through decreasing metal toxicity by transforming<br>
    metal species into immobile form. Some compounds which are excreted PSM and play
    a<br> role in remediation are organic acid, exopoly saccharides and fosfatase
    enzyme. Organic<br> acids and fosfatase enyme inactivate Al3+ and Fe2+ through
    the process of chelate and<br> precipitate respectively. Absorption of H+ from
    solution by exopolysaccharides increase<br> soil pH. Another mechanisms remediation
    by PSM is its accumulation of metal<br> contaminated in cell surface. Decreasing
    of Al3+ and Fe2+ activity and acidity can<br> increase agricultural productivity.
    This review is an effort to emphasize how PSM can<br> be used to remediate acid
    sulphate soil dominated by Al, Fe and SO42-.
