  title: Soil resilience; Managing soil quality challenges in modern agriculture
  abstract: In India, soil degradation poses a serious challenge to environmental
    quality and agricultural sustainability in both irrigated and rain-fed agro-ecosystems
    (57% of the cultivated land). The result of such degradation is a perceived decline
    or stagnation in crop yield, partial factor productivity of inputs, and quality
    of the produce. Under intensive cropping systems, the main cause of yield drop
    is a decrease in SOM and the nutrients it is connected with in the soil (Muralidharudu
    <em>et al.,</em> 2011). The vital ecological functions of soil are harmed by these
    degrading forces and processes, which eventually affect the health/quality of
    the soil. The degree of degradation soil quality assessment, fitness for use,
    resilience "ability to recover," and identification of diagnostic recovery modules
    are the only solutions available to address this crucial problem for the sustainable
    use of soil and its protection against degradation (Fig. 1). For the purpose of
    identifying the most appropriate soil quality indicators, the idea of soil quality
    and the methods for evaluating it in relation to different soil functions have
    developed to a significant degree (Fig. 2). Although the indicators are used for
    soil quality monitoring (Andrews <em>et al.,</em> 2004), they have not yet been
    established for resilience purposes to evaluate the ease and degree of recovery
    of degraded systems (Kuan <em>et al.,</em> 2006).
