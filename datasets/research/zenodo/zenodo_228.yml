  title: Soil Quality Analysis and Crop Recommendation
  abstract: Analyzing the qualities of the soil to determine<br> whether it is suitable
    for supporting plant growth is<br> known as soil quality analysis. It involves
    assessing many<br> elements, including texture, organic matter content, pH<br>
    level, and nutrient content. This evaluation assists in<br> locating any soil
    imbalances or inadequacies that may<br> have an impact on crop productivity. The
    process of<br> recommending acceptable crops to grow based on the<br> findings
    of soil analysis and other pertinent parameters is<br> known as crop recommendation.
    It fits the unique<br> requirements of various crops with the soil characteristics<br>
    existing on a certain farm or field. By choosing the most<br> suitable crops for
    the existing soil conditions, the objective<br> is to maximize crop yields and
    reduce the chance of crop<br> failure.
