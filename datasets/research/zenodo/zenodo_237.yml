  title: Studies on adsorption of carbaryl as influenced by soil organic matter (SOM)
    and other soil characteristics
  abstract: Department of Applied Chemistry, Z. H. College of Engineering &amp; Technology,
    Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh-202 002, India <em>Manuscript received 3 April
    1996, revised 17 July 1999, accepted 22 July 1999</em> Adsorption of carbaryl
    (insecticide) has been studied on soils (untreated) and soils free of organic
    matter (O.M.). Freundlich and Langmuir equations are used to characterise the
    isotherms. Simple correlation analysis shows the significant influence of organic
    matter on the adsorption of carbaryl by untreated soils. In case of O.M.-free
    soils, adsorption is found to be correlated with the clay content and specific
    surface area. The clay content of the soil (O.M.-free) accounts for a very large
    proportion of the variation in adsorption <em>(k </em>value). Exothermic nature
    of adsorption illustrates its temperature-dependence. Evaluation of thermodynamic
    parameters indicates the physical nature of adsorption.
