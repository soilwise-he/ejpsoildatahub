  title: Impact Of Organic And Conventional (Chemical) Fertilization On Soil Quality
    And Its Seasonal Variation
  abstract: "This study was carried out to explore the seasonal variations in physico-chemical\
    \ and microbiological characteristics of soil samples collected from different\
    \ types of agricultural fields in confluence point of Vellar and Manimuthar river\
    \ basin in Peruvarappur village, Cuddalore district, Tamilnadu. The fields were\
    \ selected based on the fertilization type (Organic Fertilization [OF], Chemical\
    \ Fertilization [CF]) over the past three years. Results showed that seasonally\
    \ the pH is not varied in both fields, however; the seasonal average is slightly\
    \ higher in CF field. The total nitrogen concentration showed a higher average\
    \ in OF field (3.83\xB1.73 g kg-1) than CF field (2.70\xB10.51 g kg-1). However,\
    \ available K and P showed the average concentration is higher in CF field (64.35\xB1\
    4.04 and 77.15\xB12.07) than OF field (44.06\xB11.40 g kg-1 and 64.0\xB19.7 g\
    \ kg-1). The higher seasonal average of Total Nitrogen (TC) and ammonium was found\
    \ in OF field (29.95\xB12.48 and 3.63\xB10.29) than CF field (28.8\xB13.06 and\
    \ 1.56\xB1.38) Moreover, the seasonal average of Nitrate concentration was higher\
    \ in CF field (24.61\xB12.28) than OF field (13.96\xB11.04). All the physico-chemical\
    \ properties of both fields soil are increased every first monsoon season. Zinc\
    \ and Manganese are the major metal components found in OF field (189.52\xB18.31\
    \ \u03BCg g-1) and CF field (197.17\xB111.67 \u03BCg g-1) respectively. Chemical\
    \ fertilization increases the fungal population, however; it reduced the bacterial\
    \ and actinomycetes population in CF field. The Non-linear incasement of analyzed\
    \ soil parameters and the microbial population were observed in this study. The\
    \ factors that control soil fertility are good in OF field than the CF field."
