  title: Assessment and mapping the dynamics of soil properties in selected forest
    stands from the region of Central Balkan National Park in the context of ecosystem
    services
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Forests set natural conditions and embody a repository of biological\
    \ diversity that represents a myriad of ecosystem services for human well-being.\
    \ The spatial patterns and the forest ecosystems' dynamics over time make the\
    \ forests of particular environmental significance for the provision of ecosystem\
    \ services. The terrestrial biodiversity and the sustainable management strategies'\
    \ demand for mapping and assessment of the dynamics for the condition of forest\
    \ ecosystems by drawing attention to the soil properties. In order to take on\
    \ that task, the data series obtained by the &lt;i&gt;International Co-operative\
    \ Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ (ICP Forests) for the period 1986\u20132016 were found as appropriate quantitative\
    \ indicators that convey information about the ecosystem's capacity to provide\
    \ certain regulating ecosystem services. The ICP Forests Level I sites, located\
    \ in the Central Balkan region, provide consistent information, which is collected\
    \ on a regular basis about observed forest stands.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The primary\
    \ focus of the present research is to conduct a biophysical assessment of the\
    \ forest ecosystems and to define their overall condition regarding two time series\
    \ \u2013 the periods 1992/1993 and 2015. This study attempts to introduce an innovative\
    \ approach and aims at linking the existing ICP Forests network dataset with the\
    \ ecosystem services concept and the identified spatial units from the CORINE\
    \ Land Cover (CLC) polygons for the territory of Central Balkan National Park.\
    \ On this basis and through the implementation of GIS techniques, the dynamics\
    \ of soil properties in selected forest ecosystems was analysed with regard to\
    \ their capacity to supply relevant ecosystems services, which were assessed and\
    \ mapped. The biophysical data provides robust information on the ecosystem services\
    \ and the results show the variations in the capacity of different forest sub-types\
    \ to provide ecosystem services within a well-defined land cover unit. Additionally,\
    \ the research work intended to review the generated outcomes with reference to\
    \ the DPSIR (driver-pressure-state-impact-response) method by giving feedback\
    \ on the changes in the terrestrial ecosystems in the last 25 years. Further application\
    \ of the mapping approach in assisting the communication in the decision- making\
    \ process is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;"
