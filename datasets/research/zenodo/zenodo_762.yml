  title: Utilization Of Bottled Plastic Waste For Strength Improvement Of Soil
  abstract: 'Due to an inefficient and faulty waste collection and transit system,
    a large amount of plastic waste fails to reach landfills or incinerators. Recycling
    plastic waste from water bottles has become one of the major challenges worldwide.
    The present study provides an approach for the use of plastic waste as reinforcement
    material in soil. To study effect of size and shape, plastic chips of different
    sizes (4mm x 12mm and 5mm x 15mm) had been used. A series of unconfined compression(UCC),
    direct box shear tests and swell pressure tests have been performed at four different
    percentages of fibers (0%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0% by dry weight of soil) to determine
    stress-strain and swelling behavior of plastic waste mixed soil and the influence
    on plastic waste on shear strength of soil has been observed. The experimental
    results in the form of stress-strain response are presented. Based on experimental
    test results, it is observed that the strength of soil is improved significantly
    with addition of a small percentage of plastic waste to the soil. The improvement
    in strength due to inclusion of plastic waste can be advantageously used in bearing
    capacity improvement and settlement reduction in the design of shallow foundations
    and pavement design on a weak soil.
