  title: Impact of soil addendum on arsenic uptake by rice plant in the alluvial soil
    of gangetic West Bengal, India

    received online 06 December 2020, accepted 26 December 2020</em> The present work
    is a comparative research between application of soluble and insoluble chelator
    as soil addendum against<br> arsenic (primarily As<sup>3+</sup>) toxicity on rice
    plant (Oriza sativa L.) in Gangetic alluvial soil. Experimental results showed
    that soil<br> arsenic (As) content decreased (0.15 to 0.08 mg/kg) distinctly by
    using soluble chelator of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic<br> acid (DSEDTA)
    due to phytoremediation through plant uptake. This was further authenticated by
    the higher level (2.6<br> to 2.88 micro-mole/g) of the stress marker compound
    (malonaldehyde) produced in the plants to combat the stress due to As<br> accumulation.
    Plant stress, in the present study was also supported indirectly with the help
    of other biochemical parameters<br> like chlorophyll, carbohydrate and protein.
    It was observed that the malonaldehyde contents in the plants assisted by DSEDTA<br>
    soil have quite higher compared to the plant of EDTA assisted soil (reduction
    from 2.69 to 1.9 micro-mole/g, for 1 g/kg of<br> chelator). The plants cultivated
    in EDTA assisted soil, plant health indicators like height of the plant, leaf
    chlorophyll, carbohydrate<br> and protein content were recorded comparatively
    higher. The probable reason behind this fact could be hypothesized<br> that the
    insoluble chelator (EDTA) might play some protective role that may be responsible
    to avoid plant uptake of As from<br> the soil solution.
