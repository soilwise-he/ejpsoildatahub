  title: Molecular Study of Indigenous Bacterial Community Composition on Exposure
    to Soil Arsenic Concentration Gradient
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Community structure of bacteria present in arsenic contaminated
    agricultural soil was studied with qPCR (quantitative PCR) and DGGE (Denaturing
    Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) as an indicator of extreme stresses. Copy number
    of six common bacterial taxa (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, &alpha;-, &beta;-
    and &gamma;-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes) was calculated using group specific primers
    of 16S rDNA. It revealed that soilcontaminated with low concentration of arsenic
    was dominated by both Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria but a shift towards Proteobacteria
    was observed with increasing arsenic concentration, and number of Actinobacteria
    eventually decreases. PCA (Principle Component Analysis) plot of bacterial community
    composition indicated a distinct resemblance among high arsenic content samples,
    while low arsenic content samples remained separated from others. Cluster analysis
    of soil parameters identifies three clusters, each of them was related to the
    arsenic content. Further, cluster analysis of 16S rDNA based DGGE fingerprint
    markedly distributed the soil bacterial populations into low (&lt; 10 ppm) and
    high (&gt; 10 ppm) arsenic content subgroups. Following analysis of diversity
    indices shows significant variation in bacterial community structure. MDS (Multi
    Dimensional Scaling) plot revealed distinction in the distribution of each sample
    denoting variation in bacterial diversity. Phylogenetic sequence analysis of fragments
    excised from DGGE gel revealed the presence of &gamma;-Proteobacteria group across
    the study sites. Collectively, our experiments indicated that gradient of arsenic
    contamination affected the shape of the soil bacterial population by significant
    structural shift.&lt;/p&gt;'
