  title: ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LIPOLYTIC BACTERIA FROM OIL CONTAMINATED
    SOIL FROM PETROL BUNK AT SOUTHEAST BANGALORE.
  abstract: "The isolation of oil contaminated sites and gravimetric analysis of degradation\
    \ in which, two bacterial formed maximum clearing zones on minerals salt medium.\
    \ An increase in cell number indicating that the bacterial isolation was responsible\
    \ for the oil degradation. The collected oil contaminated sites at kormongala,\
    \ Indra nagar, MTTC culture, micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., pseudomonas spp.,\
    \ which are able to utilize the oil in soil as carbon sources, were added to oil\
    \ contaminated soil sample, the growth profiles were determined by monitoring\
    \ the optical density, dry weight and Ph of the culture utilizing lubricating\
    \ oil as sole sources of carbon, Bushnell Haas media supplemented with petrol,\
    \ kerosene and diesel as sole carbon sources was used for isolation of bacteria\
    \ capable of degrading these petroleum fractionates. From three soil sample and\
    \ two water sample, a total of nine bacterial strains were isolated capable of\
    \ degrading petrol, kerosene and diesel with varying tolerance capacities, the\
    \ isolates were identify by using standard biochemical test and morphological\
    \ studies and it was determined that these strains belong to six bacterial genera\
    \ .the present study suggest that the isolated bacterial species could be employed\
    \ for bioremediation in environment polluted with petroleum and its products,\
    \ indigenously from the soil and water contaminated with crude oil in the vicinity\
    \ of oil drilling well were found to be most efficient crude oil utilize as turbidity\
    \ observed by spectrophotometrically. In the various study of lipolytic bacteria\
    \ concluded that the taken of oil contaminated soil from from petroleum bunk and\
    \ to identify their biochemical characterization by using various sources. How\
    \ it\u2019s helpful for characterize by using of lipolytic bacteria."
