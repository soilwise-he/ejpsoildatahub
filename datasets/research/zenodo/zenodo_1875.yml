  title: Hay-bait traps are a useful tool for sampling of soil dwelling millipedes
    and centipedes
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Some species of centipedes and millipedes inhabit upper soil\
    \ layers exclusively and are not recorded by pitfall trapping. Because of their\
    \ sensitivity to soil conditions, they can be sampled quantitatively for evaluation\
    \ of soil conditions. Soil samples are heavy to transport and their processing\
    \ is time consuming, and such sampling leads to disturbance of the soil surface\
    \ which land-owners do not like. We evaluated the use of hay-bait traps to sample\
    \ soil dwelling millipedes and centipedes. The effectiveness of this method was\
    \ found to be similar to the effectiveness of soil sampling. Hay-bait traps installed\
    \ for 8\u201310 weeks can substitute for direct soil sampling in ecological and\
    \ inventory studies.&lt;/p&gt;"
