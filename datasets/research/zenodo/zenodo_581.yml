  title: 'Effect of conservation agriculture on soil moisture content and biomass
    water productivity: Case study of crop residues as soil cover | IJAAR'
  abstract: One of the important principles of Conservation Agricultural Research
    is the permanent soil cover with crop residues which enhances soil and water productivity
    that leads to improved agricultural productivity. The effect of crop residues
    on soil moisture content, relative growth rate, and biomass water productivity
    was examined in a completely randomized design at the University of Reading, Berkshire
    district, England. Straw treatment was significant on moisture content and water
    use efficiency at (p&lt; 0.01) respectively while there is no significant difference
    in mean relative growth rate and dry final biomass weights. The study concluded
    that soil moisture content is conserved with increased use of crop residues as
    soil cover. The study, therefore, recommended that project-based research on Conservation
    Agriculture should be carried out by governments and NGOs that will involve farmers;
    also they should provide support for the knowledge diffusion of Conservation Agriculture
    to local farmers since it will improve yield and productivity. Extension agents
    and other agencies that work with farmers should also be properly trained to be
    able to disseminate this technology to farmers.
