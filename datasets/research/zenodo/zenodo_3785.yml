  title: "Statistical Assessment Of Models For Determination Of Soil \u2013 Water\
    \ Characteristic Curves Of Sand Soils"
  abstract: 'Characterization of the engineering behavior of<br>

    unsaturated soil is dependent on the soil-water characteristic curve<br>

    (SWCC), a graphical representation of the relationship between water<br>

    content or degree of saturation and soil suction. A reasonable<br>

    description of the SWCC is thus important for the accurate prediction<br>

    of unsaturated soil parameters. The measurement procedures for<br>

    determining the SWCC, however, are difficult, expensive, and timeconsuming.<br>

    During the past few decades, researchers have laid a<br>

    major focus on developing empirical equations for predicting the<br>

    SWCC, with a large number of empirical models suggested. One of<br>

    the most crucial questions is how precisely existing equations can<br>

    represent the SWCC. As different models have different ranges of<br>

    capability, it is essential to evaluate the precision of the SWCC<br>

    models used for each particular soil type for better SWCC estimation.<br>

    It is expected that better estimation of SWCC would be achieved via<br>

    a thorough statistical analysis of its distribution within a particular<br>

    soil class. With this in view, a statistical analysis was conducted in<br>

    order to evaluate the reliability of the SWCC prediction models<br>

    against laboratory measurement. Optimization techniques were used<br>

    to obtain the best-fit of the model parameters in four forms of SWCC<br>

    equation, using laboratory data for relatively coarse-textured (i.e.,<br>

    sandy) soil. The four most prominent SWCCs were evaluated and<br>

    computed for each sample. The result shows that the Brooks and<br>

    Corey model is the most consistent in describing the SWCC for sand<br>

    soil type. The Brooks and Corey model prediction also exhibit<br>

    compatibility with samples ranging from low to high soil water<br>
