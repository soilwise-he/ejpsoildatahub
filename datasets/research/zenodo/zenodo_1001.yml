  title: Assessment of some Chemical Properties of Isan - Ekiti Soil, Southwestern
    Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Increase in knowledge of Chemical properties of soil will prevent
    or reduce road failure in tropical climate such as Nigeria. This study aimed at
    assessing some chemical properties of lateritic soil deposited in Isan - Ekiti,
    South western Nigeria. Soil samples collected from the study area were subjected
    to CEC, Organic Carbon content, pH and Refractive Index tests. The CEC, Organic
    Carbon content, pH and Refractive Indices values for all the soil samples varied
    from 35.00 to 58.00 , 31.00 to 46.00 , 6.00 to 6.21 and 1.529 to 1.533 respectively.
    It could be generally observed there were presence of large deposit of lateritic
    soil with large contents of clay and its minerals. The soil in the study area
    were acidic in nature though weak and likely to have high retention capacity.
    There could be presence of clay minerals such as Allophone, Chlorite, Illite and
    Steatite in study area&#39;s soil. Further study on the other Engineering properties
    of the soil should be carried out. Silas A. Oladapo | Adeyemi E. Adetoro &quot;Assessment
