  title: Improved Runoff Simulations for a Highly Varying Soil Depth and Complex Terrain
    Watershed in the Loess Plateau with the Community Land Model Version 5
  abstract: This study aimed to improve runoff simulations and explore deep soil hydrological
    processes for a watershed in the center of the Loess Plateau (LP), China. This
    watershed, the Wuding River Basin (WRB), has very complex topography, with soil
    depths ranging from 0 to 197 m. The hydrological model used for our simulations
    was Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research. Actual soil depths and river channels were incorporated
    into CLM5 to realistically represent the physical features of the WRB. Through
    sensitivity tests, CLM5 with 150 soil layers produced the most reasonable results
    and was adopted for this study. Our results showed that CLM5 with actual soil
    depths significantly suppressed unrealistic variations of the simulated sub-surface
    runoff when compared to the default simulations with a fixed soil depth of 8 m.
    In addition, CLM5 with higher-resolution soil layering slightly improved runoff
    simulations, but generated simulations with much smoother vertical water flows
    that were consistent with the uniform distribution of soil textures in our study
    watershed. The runoff simulations were further improved by the addition of river
    channels to CLM5, where the seasonal variability of the simulated runoff was reasonably
    captured. Moreover, the magnitude of the simulated runoff remarkably decreased
    with increased soil evaporation by lowering the soil water content threshold,
    which triggers surface resistance. The lowered threshold was consistent with the
    loess soil, which has a high sand component. Such soils often generate stronger
    soil evaporation than soils dominated by clay. Finally, with the above changes
    in CLM5, the simulated total runoff matched very closely with observations. When
    compared with those for the default runoff simulations, the correlation coefficient,
    root-mean-square error, and Nash Sutcliffe coefficient for the improved simulations
    changed dramatically from 0.02, 10.37 mm, and -12.34 to 0.62, 1.8 mm, and 0.61.
    The results in this study provide strong physical insight for further investigation
    of hydrological processes in complex terrain with deep soils.
