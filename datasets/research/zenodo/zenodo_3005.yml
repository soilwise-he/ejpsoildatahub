  title: Evaluation of Growth Parameters of Tomato Seeds Planted in Crude Oil Polluted
    Soil Remediated with Strains of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  abstract: The beneficial effects of bioremediation with<br> oil-degrading microorganism,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis, on tomato seedlings growth in oil-<br>
    contaminated soil was investigated. The effect of bioremediation was examined
    with Pseudomonas<br> aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis on phytotoxicity, as<br>
    measured by tomato seed growth. Tomato growth<br> parameters (leaf length, height,
    seed germination,<br> chlorosis, stunted growth) were evaluated daily for<br>
    15days.Some qualitative morphological<br> observations made on the seedlings were
    also observed<br> for seedlings. In the untreated control as well as the<br> treated
    experimental samples (Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br> and Bacillus subtilis), sprouting
    of the seeds were rapid<br> and completed in a few days, the seedlings showed
    steady<br> growth and morphologically normal. In the control soils<br> however,
    sprouting was sluggish, and growth was<br> stunted, yellowing of the leaves was
    observed (chlorosis);<br> a number of the seedlings were folded at the tips. These<br>
    were indications of phytotoxicity resulting from oil<br> pollution. The results
    of the present research have<br> proven the bioremediation potential of bacterial
    isolates,<br> for crude oil contamination which also showed<br> significant growth
    potential for the tomato seeds.
