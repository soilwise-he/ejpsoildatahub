  title: Stabilization of Black Cotton Soil by Using Waste Foundry Sand and Crushed
    Waste Glass
  abstract: Generally Black Cotton Soil exhibits undesirable engineering properties
    like shrinkage and swelling properties losses its strength, when come in contact
    with water. Thereby poor bearing capacity and higher compressibility. Thus the
    improvement of soil at a site is indispensable. There are many methods and stabilizers
    to improve the strength of soil like jute, gypsum, fly ash. Rice-husk ash. Cement,
    lime, used rubber tyres etc. In the present study, we added Waste Foundry Sand
    and Crushed Waste Glass as stabilizer to improve the properties of Black Cotton
    soil. Black Cotton Soil used in this project work is carried from Maharashtra.
    The objective of this study is to improve the strength of the Black Cotton soil
    by making Soil- Waste Foundry Sand and Soil- Waste Foundry Sand-Crushed Glass
    Powder mixture. Specimens is to be prepared to investigate the properties of soil
    out of these specimens are prepared by Replacing 2 %, 4%, 6% . Waste Glass Powder
    with varying percentage Waste Foundry Sand as 10%,20%, 30%.[4] Modified Proctor
    Test, CBR test and Free Swell Index test is to be conducted to analyze the Optimum
    Moisture Content (OMC), Maximum Dry Density (MDD) and compressive strength of
    soil mixture, CBR value and Free Swell Index.
