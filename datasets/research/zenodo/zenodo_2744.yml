  title: 'Afforestation of savannah using cocoa agroforestry: :impacts on ecosystem
    services and effects of associated tree species on soil fertility'
  abstract: 'Past studies showed a gradual expansion of forest over savannah in forest-savannah
    transition zones in Central Africa. While the natural encroachment of savannah
    by forest is more and more impeded by human activities, farmers in Cameroon have
    proven that afforestation of savannah is achievable using cocoa and specific technics
    to build up an associated tree canopy. Furthermore, mature cocoa agroforestry
    systems created on savannah (S-cAFS) or in forest (F-cAFS) exhibit comparable
    multi-strata structures. By combining measurements of cocoa yield, litterfall,
    soil quality, carbon storage and tree species diversity along an age gradient
    (1 to 70 years), we showed that those variables in S- and F-cAFS tended to comparable
    levels after several decades. Results also emphasized the ability of S-cAFS to
    increase most of the ecosystem services (including soil fertility and plant diversity)
    although the time needed to reach levels found in F-cAFS varied strongly amongst
    variables.

    In addition to the previous study, we compared in a second time the impacts of
    the presence of shade trees on soil functions and cocoa yield in cocoa farms set
    up after savannah. To do so, we sampled 5 cocoa monocultures and 8 cAFS. Cocoa
    yield did not vary between these systems. Nonetheless, the soil P availability
    was improved in cAFS compared to monocultures. Within cAFS, unshaded cocoa conditions
    showed the lowest soil functions associated with the low leaf litter quality of
    cocoa plants. Tree species had contrasting effects on soil functions. Cocoa association
    with the fruit trees Canarium schweinfurthii and Dacryodes edulis did not improve
    soil fertility compared with unshaded cocoa, while associations with the legume
    tree Albizia adianthifolia, or the timber trees Milicia excelsa and Ceiba pentandra
    significantly improved soil N and P availability. These differences could be explained
    by the quality of the recycled litter, since low litter recalcitrance was strongly
    associated with increases in soil N and P availability, while soil pH and soil
    C contents increased with litter Ca restitution from C. pentandra.

    Our results highlighted the positive impacts of cAFS establishment in savannah
    on soil fertility, species diversity and carbon storage in biomass and soil over
    time. Furthermore, we showed that using specific trees for soil quality and compatible
    with cocoa, and other trees for the provision of goods, can ensure cocoa AFS multifunctionality
    and sustainability. Future research will need to understand how plant diversity
    in these cocoa systems, can help to adapt to climate change.
