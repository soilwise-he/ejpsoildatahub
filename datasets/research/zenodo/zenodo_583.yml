  title: Soil Erosion Risk Assessment Using Gis Based Usle Model For Soil And Water
    Conservation Planning In Somodo Watershed, South West Ethiopia
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>Soil erosion\
    \ is natural phenomena and is modified by biophysical environment comprising soil,\
    \ climate, terrain, ground cover and their interactions. Due to different factors,\
    \ it is difficult to make watershed management successful in all areas at one\
    \ time. Because of this, prioritization of sub watershed is very important for\
    \ soil conservation planning and implementation. In Somodo watershed more than\
    \ five years different soil and water conservation technologies were implemented\
    \ and satisfactory result was not recorded. In this aspect, it is important to\
    \ consider further watershed management  planning., This study therefore investigated\
    \ soil erosion risk assessment using GIS and USLE model for soil and water conservation\
    \ in Somodo watershed southwestern Ethiopia with the aim of estimating soil erosion\
    \ rate and identify soil erosion hot pot areas through prioritization of sub watershed\
    \ in Somodo watershed by the help of GIS based USLE model. Both primary and secondary\
    \ data sources were used for model input. These data were computed at a grid level\
    \ with 30*30m resolution and then overlaid to generate mean annual soil loss by\
    \ the help of raster calculator in Arc GIS tool. Results of the study showed that,\
    \ the mean annual soil loss of the watershed was 18.69 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ ranging from 0 to 131.21. More than 75% of the watershed have soil loss greater\
    \ than 20 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> and only 25% of the area have\
    \ soil loss less than 10</em> <em>ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>.On the\
    \ bases of mean annual soil loss SW-4, SW-6 and SW-7 were under slight (0-10 ton\
    \ ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) erosion severity level, while the remaining\
    \  SW-2, SW-3 and SW-8 were under moderate (10-20 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ level. And SW-1 was in high (20-30 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) erosion\
    \ severity level, where as SW-5 and SW-9 were found in very high (&gt;30 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ year<sup>-1</sup>) erosion severity level. Since large area of the watershed\
    \ has soil loss more than tolerable level (11 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ attention should be given to identify erosion hot spot areas to minimize the\
    \ on-site and off-site problems. Therefore, the study suggested that for effective\
    \ watershed management and soil conservation planning, these sub-watershed priorities\
    \ should be used in the watershed. </em>"
