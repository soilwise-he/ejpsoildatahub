  title: HYDROGEL AND ORGANIC CARBON SOIL
  abstract: <em>All over the world, including around the Aral region, the problem
    of strengthening mobile sands from wind erosion and preventing their rise into
    the atmosphere by creating a strong surface crust is urgent. One of the important
    promising directions in this area is the use of cheap, easily accessible local
    raw materials in mobile soil and sand dispersions. When forming a structure in
    mobile sands and soil dispersions, the choice of reinforcing polymer reagents
    and the determination of aspects of their structure formation becomes important.
    Of particular importance is the study of the effect of polymer hydrogels on soil
    organic carbon.</em>
