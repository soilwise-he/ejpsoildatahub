  title: Effects of soil management practices on the composition of soil-inhabiting
    micro arthropods
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> Microarthropods play a significant role in\
    \ accelerating plant residue decomposition through their interactions with the\
    \ microflora. During the present investigation, attempts were made to investigate\
    \ the effects of 15 different soil management practices on soil microarthropods\
    \ across rainy, postrainy, and dry seasons in Alfisol maize agroecosystems. The\
    \ present experiment was carried out in the field designated RM19B on the research\
    \ farm at the ICRISAT Asia Center. Population densitites of soil inhabiting microarthropods\
    \ in each experimental plot across the treatments were sampled using 10 cm core\
    \ device of 4.5 cm diameter, whose interior widened slightly to relieve compression\
    \ of soil. Acarina was dominant among the microarthropods, the mean percentage\
    \ composition ranging between 40.6 and 70 % across the treatments. Composition\
    \ ranged from 13 to 42.5 % across the 15 treatments. The soil\u2013inhabiting\
    \ arthropods collected across the 15 soil management treatments such as different\
    \ tillage and organic amendments with annual crop and perennial ley treatments\
    \ belonged to 29 different arthropod taxa. <strong>Key Words:</strong> Microarthropods,\
    \ population densities, Acarina, soil management practices. <strong>REFERENCES</strong>\
