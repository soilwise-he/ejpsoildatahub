  title: Application of Dolomite as Soil Conditioner to pH and Exchangeable Al in
    Inceptisol
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT


    Soil fertility is the state of the soil where water, water and nutrients are in
    a state that is quite balanced and can be obtained according to the needs of plants,
    including the physical, chemical and biological needs of the soil. Lack of soil
    fertility will affect plant growth and productivity so that it is less than optimal.
    Therefore, it is very necessary to increase soil fertility through soil improvement,
    one of which is dolomite. Inceptisols are soil orders that have not developed
    further with the characteristics of a thick solum between 1.5-10 meters above
    the parent material, reacts acidly with a pH of 4.5-6.5, if it undergoes further
    development the pH increases to less than 5.0, and base saturation is from low
    to low. currently. The texture of this whole solum is generally clayey, while
    the structure is crumbly and the consistency is loose. In general, the fertility
    and chemical properties of Inceptisols are relatively low, but efforts can still
    be made to improve with appropriate handling and technology, pH in Inceptisol
    soils is one of the obstacles in efforts to increase soil productivity. The application
    of dolomite on acidic agricultural soils is to reduce or eliminate the adverse
    effects of acid soils, which generally contain high enough quantities of exchangeable
    aluminum ions so that they can poison plants. This test was carried out at the
    Experimental Field of the Chemical Laboratory of Soil Fertility and Plant Nutrition,
    Department of Soil Science and Land Resources, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas
    Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Sumedang Regency, West Java, which is located at an altitude
    of 794 m above sea level. The experiment used a randomized block design (RAK).
    In accordance with the objectives of the experiment, five dolomite test treatments
    were set with five replications. Dolomite affects the process of increasing pH
    and decreasing exchangeable Al. Giving the test dose of dolomite equivalent to
    1.5 doses of dolomite was able to increase pH and decrease Al-exchable.'
