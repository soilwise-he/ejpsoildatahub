  title: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HEAVY METALS IN CARICA PAPAYA (PAWPAW ) FRUIT AND
    SOIL IN SELECTED URBAN, RURAL AND FORESTLAND IN OWERRI, IMO STATE
  abstract: In most developing coun tries like Nigeria, the quest for rapid economic
    growth through urbanization, industrialization and modern agriculture have resulted
    in concomitant inflow of several contaminants (such as heavy metals) into the
    environment. This study assessed the comparative levels of heavy metals in pawpaw
    fruits and soils of urban, rural and forest land in Owerri Imo State, Southeastern
    Nigeria. Randomly, soil samples (0-30 cm depth) and partially ripe pawpaw fruits
    were collected each from urban, rural and forest land. Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Ni,
    Zn, Cu, Cr, Co and Fe) were analyzed using standard methods. Data were subjected
    to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation using Genstat Statistical Package
    Version 18. The heavy metals in the soil samples were low and varied significantly
    (P&lt;0.05) apart from Cr, Co and Fe. With the exception of Cu, heavy metals were
    generally more concentrated in urban soils followed by rural and forest soils
    where decreasing pattern of urban (1.534 mgkg-1) &gt; forest (1.534 mgkg-1) &gt;
    rural (1.426 mgkg-1) was recorded. Heavy metal concentrations of the pawpaw fruit
    also differed significantly (P&lt;0.05) apart from Co and Fe. Similar pattern
    of decreasing trend (urban &gt; rural &gt; forest) like for the soil, was observed
    for pawpaw fruits apart from Cu and Cr contents that followed decreasing trend
    of urban &gt; forest &gt; rural. In addition, metal transfer factor was not uniform
    for the heavy metals across the sites. However, least values of metal transfer
    factor for Co (0.51-0.21) and Fe (0.44-0.32) suggested that Co and Fe are not
    easily mobilized in pawpaw tree. Positive significant relationship that Pb, Cd,
    Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr and Fe had with pawpaw Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn and Fe indicated strong influence
    of these metals on each other. There is need for occasional monitoring of these
    heavy metals in the soil and pawpaw fruit to prevent excessive build up of these
    heavy metals in the human food chain.
