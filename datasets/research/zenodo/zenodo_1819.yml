  title: Experimental Study On Behaviour Of Stone Column On Soft Soil With And Without
    Geosynthetics
  abstract: '<strong>The fine grained soils such as soft clays,loose silts and most
    organic soils are characterized by low undrained shear strength,low bearing capacity,high
    compressibility and low permeability. These lead to soil stability problems when
    construction work is taken on such type of soil. O n account of poor permeability
    of the soil,the dissipation of pore water is very slow. It takes a long time for
    the soil to consolidate and stabilize on its own,thereby delaying the construction
    activities on such soils. In such situations,soil needs stabilization before construction.
    Hence suitable ground improvement method has to be adopted to improve the engineering
    properties of soil.</strong>
