  title: 'Abundance and diversity of lianas in a Neotropical dry forest: the influence
    of soil moisture'
  abstract: "&lt;b&gt;Background and aims&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Based on data across tropical\
    \ forests, a leading hypothesis posits that lianas are better competitors than\
    \ trees under water shortage. Evaluating this hypothesis at a local scale may\
    \ provide insights into its generality. We tested whether the abundance of lianas\
    \ \u2013relative to trees\u2013 decreases with soil moisture in a Neotropical\
    \ dry forest. We also evaluated the influence of water availability on liana diversity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 Lianas (\u2265 1 cm diameter) and trees (\u2265 1.5 m height) were counted\
    \ and identified, and soil moisture was measured, in twenty 10 \xD7 10 m plots\
    \ at different distances to water sources. Linear regressions assessed the relationships\
    \ between water availability and relative abundance and diversity of lianas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key\
    \ Results&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 We found a significant an d positive relationship between\
    \ the relative abundance of lianas and water availability. Liana density ranged\
    \ from 21 to 77 individuals per plot. Soil moisture did not influence liana species\
    \ richness (S) or Fisher's \u03B1. Eighteen liana species were recorded , from\
    \ ten families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Our results show\
    \ that, in contrast with geographic and regional patterns, relative abundance\
    \ and diversity of lianas at a local scale are not favoured by water shortage.\
    \ This suggests that different mechanisms may prevail in the liana-tree interaction\
    \ across water availability gradients."
