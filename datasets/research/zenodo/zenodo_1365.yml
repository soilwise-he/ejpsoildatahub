  title: Losses in microbial functional diversity reduce the rate of key soil processes
  abstract: The consequences of microbial functional diversity loss on key ecosystem
    processes remain debatable due to lack of firm evidence from observational or
    manipulative experiments for a link between microbial functional diversity and
    specialized ecosystem functions. Here, we conducted a microcosm experiment to
    test for a link between multiple microbial functional diversity (nitrifiers, methanotrophs
    and denitrifiers) and corresponding specialized soil functions (nitrate availability,
    methane, and nitrous oxide flux) using the dilution-to-extinction approach. We
    found that reductions in functional microbial diversity led to declines in the
    rates of specialized soil processes. Additionally, partial correlations provided
    statistical evidence that the correlations between microbial functional diversity
    and specialized functions were maintained after accounting for functional gene
    abundance (qPCR data) and substrate availability. Our analyses further suggested
    little redundancy in the relationship between microbial functional diversity and
    specialized ecosystem functions. Our work provides experimental evidence that
    microbial functional diversity is critical and directly linked to maintaining
    the rates of specialized soil processes in terrestrial ecosystems.
