  title: Molecular Characterization Of Cadmium-Resistant Cupriavidus Spp. And Ralstonia
    Solanacearum Isolated From Soil And Plants In Taiwan
  abstract: <em>Cadmium is a natural heavy-metal element. It is highly toxic and a
    vital industrial pollutant to the environment. In order to survive in heavy-metal
    polluted environments, some bacteria can withstand high concentrations of heavy
    metals in environment due to their specific mechanisms, including the transport
    of heavy metal ions out of the cell. Three kinds of membrane-bound-proteins are
    known to participate in this transport. The objective of this study was to determine
    the cadmium-resistant properties and possible mechanism among strains of Cupriavidus
    metallidurans (= Ralstonia eutropha), C. taiwanensis (=R. taiwanensis) and</em>
    <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em> <em>isolated from soil and plants in Taiwan. Strains
    tested include six strains, rcd 6, 8, 19 (C. metallidurans) and rcd 12, 14, 21
    (C. taiwanensis), from cadmium-polluted soil, seventeen strains, nod 1 to nod
    5 and nod s1 to s12 (C. taiwanensis) from root nodules of two Mimosa species (M.
    pudica and M. diplotricha), and ten strains of R. solanacearum isolated from different
    diseased plants. Sequence analysis of 16S-23S rDNA ITS and nifH gene regions were
    used to confirm the taxonomic classification of these bacteria. However, the 624-bp
    PCR product of nifH gene was only amplified from strains nod 1 to nod 3 and nod
    s1 to s12, but not from other tested strains of Cupriavidus and Ralstonia spp.
    These tested strains could tolerate cadmium within the range from 0.67 to 6.70
    mM. The gene, czcC, thought to encode the outer membrane factor (OMF) of czc efflux
    system, was found in fifteen tested strains (rcd 6, 8, 12, 14, 19, 21; nod s1
    to s6, s9, s11; PSS161) by PCR. Especially, strains rcd 12, 14, and 21 which could
    tolerate higher cadmium concentration (6.70 mM) harbored the entire czc operon.
    In addition, the PCR products revealed that cadmium-tolerant strains contained
    at least a portion of the czc operon and efflux mechanism was confirmed by cadmium
    uptake test. The results here indicated that cadmium resistant capability in Cupriavidus
    spp. and R. solanacearum was related to the presence of czcC or czc operon. </em>
