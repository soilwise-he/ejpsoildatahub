  title: Influence of Land Cover Type, Slope, and Soil Density of Surface Runoff
  abstract: <pre><em>One of the factors that caused flooding in Indonesia and in the
    world is the amount of surface runoff. And in this study, it will examine surface
    runoff with variations in land cover type, slope of land, and soil density using
    laboratory methods. Based on the results of the study, it can be seen that the
    effect of land cover variation on surface runoff is 75%. The variation of land
    slope has an effect on surface runoff with R2 maximum of 0.9643 or 96.43% and
    R2 minimum of 0.25 or 25%. Then, it was found that the cover of mini elephant
    grass land in each experiment had low</em><em>er</em><em> discharge compared to
    the cover of Japanese grass land and soil in seconds to 360. This indicates that
    the cover of mini elephant grass land can minimize surface runoff and can be used
    as a reference for grass use in a region.</em></pre>
