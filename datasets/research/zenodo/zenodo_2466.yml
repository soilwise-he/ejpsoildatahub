  title: Effectiveness of integrated solarization technology in managing soil-borne
    pathogens and weeds in citrus seedlings under greenhouse conditions
  abstract: "Solarization Technology utilizes solar radiation to kill soil-borne pests,\
    \ diseases, and weeds in an environmentally and eco-friendly way. In this study,\
    \ we assessed the efficacy of integrating solarisation with sticky traps on two\
    \ potting mixtures (sawdust and soil) for three Citrus species (Citrus sinensis,\_\
    C. reticulata,\_and\_C. limon). Eight treatments were tested viz., non-solarized\
    \ sawdust, non-solarized soil, solarized soil, solarized soil with sticky traps,\
    \ non-solarized soil with sticky traps, non-solarized sawdust with sticky traps,\
    \ solarized sawdust, and solarized sawdust with sticky traps, each replicated\
    \ thrice and were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). Thirty\
    \ sterilized seeds of each Citrus species were sown per treatment and monitored\
    \ for one year in 2019. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference\
    \ in weed control between the treatments at p \u2264 0.05. Tukey\u2019s post hoc\
    \ test showed weed growth differences between treatments with sawdust and ones\
    \ with soil as media. More weeds grew in non-solarized soil (32%), compared to\
    \ non-solarized soil with sticky traps (30%), solarized soil with sticky traps\
    \ (21%), solarized soil (17%), and treatments with sawdust media did not allow\
    \ weed growth (0%). A Kruskal Wallis test revealed a significant effect of treatments\
    \ on the survival percentage of\_Citrus\_seedlings (X2\_= 36.008, df = 7, p< 0.001),\
    \ mean of chewed leaves (X2\_= 20.850, df = 7, p = 0.004) and percentage levels\
    \ of low chlorophyll (X2\_= 21.073, df = 7, p =0.004) at the p \u2264 0.05 level.\
    \ Highest number of Citrus seedlings with folded leaves were observed in non-solarized\
    \ sawdust with sticky traps (mean rank = 119.50), followed by non-solarized soil\
    \ with sticky traps (112.22), and solarized sawdust (107.69), while the lowest\
    \ in non-solarized sawdust (90.96), solarized soil (90.91), non-solarized soil\
    \ (88.25), solarized sawdust with sticky traps (85.44) and lastly solarized soil\
    \ with sticky traps (82.54).\_Citrus\_seedlings with sawdust media were observed\
    \ to be nitrogen deficient (Mean ranks 118.43 - 141.63). Solarized soil with sticky\
    \ traps had the least number of\_Citrus seedlings with leaf miner symptoms (Mean\
    \ rank = 12.50). Therefore, solarized soil with sticky traps was the most suitable\
    \ treatment for the control of soil-borne pathogens. Treatments with sawdust media\
    \ effectively stopped weed growth while those with solarized soil media reduced\
    \ their growth. Integration of sticky traps was very pivotal in the management\
    \ of whiteflies and other honey dew secreting insects. We recommend a similar\
    \ study under field conditions."
