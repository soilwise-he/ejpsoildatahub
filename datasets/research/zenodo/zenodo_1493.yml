  title: 'Biodegradation of Pesticides by Microorganisms Isolated from Agriculture
    Soil Source: An Invitro Study'
  abstract: "Agriculture is a potent source of various<br> pesticides and microorganisms.\
    \ Pesticides are a large<br> and varied group of substances that are specifically<br>\
    \ designed to kill biological organisms including weeds,<br> insects, and rodents.\
    \ However, the extensive use of<br> pesticides may result in their accumulation\
    \ in<br> agricultural produce.Pesticides are well known in<br> preventing and\
    \ controlling the diseases and pests of<br> crops, but at the same time pesticide\
    \ residues have<br> brought serious harm to human\u2019s health and the<br> environment.Biodegradation\
    \ is an ecofriendly, cost<br> effective, highly efficient approach and Pesticides\
    \ of<br> different varieties can be obtained based on agricultural<br> soil and\
    \ biodegradation of Microorganisms.The present<br> study was aimed to identify\
    \ and isolate pesticides<br> degrading microorganisms from soil sources. Also\
    \ based<br> on the perimetry experiments, Monocil pesticide showed<br> maximum\
    \ degradation. Optimization has been carried<br> out with different concentrations\
    \ of Pesticides,<br> Temperature and pH on microbes and trace elements for<br>\
    \ the degradation.based on area.The present study is<br> sensitive to eliminating\
    \ the level of toxicity from the<br> environment and it can be coupled with other\
    \ physical<br> and chemical treatment methods to improve the soil<br> quality\
    \ in agricultural fields."
