  title: Migratory Soil Nematode Feeding Group Fauna and Their Spatial Distribution
    in a Sampled Portion of a Cultivated Farmland within University Of Maiduguri,
    Maiduguri, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Systematic sampling was engaged to determine the migratory soil
    nematode fauna with respect to functional feeding groups, present in a cultivated
    farmland within the University of Maiduguri, using two methods which were the
    sieving and extraction tray methods. This was done to determine the abundance
    of the various migratory soil nematode feeding groups, their spatial distribution
    and trophic structure within a measured sampling plot of 9m by 8m (72m2).&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Nematodes can be classified into functional feeding groups based on their
    feeding habits, which can often be deduced from the structure of their mouth parts.
    Five groups of these soil nematodes were recorded, implying that nematodes that
    are both beneficial and harmful to plant fauna were present in the sampled area.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Soil nematodes were recorded along all five horizontal sampling plains
    (coded as SMA-SME). On each of these five horizontal plains &ndash; with each
    containing ten (10) sampling points, some of the sampling points did not record
    nematodes. Bacteria feeders recorded the highest %abundance of 26.3% while Omnivore
    feeders had the least % abundance of 11.6%. The combined abundance of bacterial
    and fungal feeders was 43.2%, which represents the nematode groups that help in
    re-cycling of nutrients through the provision of nitrogen in the soil. The trophic
    level stratification based abundance in terms of ratio of soil nematode groups
    was 7: 2 for ratio of &ldquo;2nd + 3rd trophic levels&rdquo; to &ldquo;1st trophic
    level&rdquo;, a value that indicates that the combined activities of soil nematode
    groups in the 1st and 2nd trophic levels may assist in soil quality maintenance
    activities which may also help check the activities of those of the 1st trophic
    level (Herbivore feeders). The major plant parasitizing nematodes (Herbivore feeders)
    accounted for 23.2% of the total abundance of these migratory soil nematode groups.
    However, out of the total of 50 sampling points examined from the marked out portion
    on the farmland, 15 points (30%) recorded no nematodes while 35 points (70%) recorded
    soil nematodes indicating a significant spatial spread or representation of these
    migratory soil nematode groups. Thirty percent (30%) of the sampling points recorded
    two groups of these soil nematodes and 2% recorded three groups. The nature of
    the compositional aggregations may likely allow for ecosystem related interactions
    between different soil nematode groups which could be useful for support of soil
    fertility related activities.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
