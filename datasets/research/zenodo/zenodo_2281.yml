  title: 'Simultaneous application of two herbicides and green compost in a field
    experiment: Implications on soil microbial community'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous use of herbicides and organic amendments is\
    \ a common agricultural practice that may modify the behavior of the herbicides\
    \ themselves and affect the microbial community in soils. There is little information\
    \ about the changes in the soil microbial community by this agricultural practice\
    \ under real field conditions. The aim of this work was to assess the effects\
    \ on the soil microbial community (abundance, activity, and structure) of the\
    \ following two herbicides triasulfuron (TSF) and prosulfocarb (PSC) applied as\
    \ individual or combined formulations in an unamended soil (Soil) and in a soil\
    \ amended with green compost (Soil\u202F+\u202FGC) at field scale. Herbicide dissipation,\
    \ soil biomass, respiration, dehydrogenase activity (DHA), and the profile of\
    \ phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were monitored for 100\u202Fdays. Triasulfuron\
    \ recorded a slower dissipation rate than PSC. The dissipation rate of TSF decreased\
    \ in the GC-amended soils compared to the unamended ones. Furthermore, the Soil\u202F\
    +\u202FGC recorded a higher soil biomass and respiration than the unamended ones.\
    \ In the GC-amended soil, biomass values decreased with individual or combined\
    \ TSF application compared to the Soil\u202F+\u202FGC control, while biomass values\
    \ in the unamended soil increased with the application of combined herbicides\
    \ after 100\u202Fdays. In general, soil respiration values decreased with the\
    \ application of herbicides in both the unamended and GC-amended soils. This negative\
    \ effect was higher for the combined TSF\u202F+\u202FPSC application. DHA values\
    \ decreased over time in the unamended soils treated with herbicides, but this\
    \ decrease was not observed in the GC-amended soil. The microbial structure clearly\
    \ changed throughout the experiment under the different conditions assayed. After\
    \ 100\u202Fdays of simultaneous TSF\u202F+\u202FPSC application, there was a significant\
    \ increase in Gram-positive bacteria and a significant decrease in Gram-negative\
    \ bacteria and Actinobacteria in the unamended soil. The GC-amended soil minimized\
    \ the effects of TSF\u202F+\u202FPSC, and only the relative abundance of Actinobacteria\
    \ increased at 100\u202Fdays. The microbial community in the unamended and GC-amended\
    \ soils behaved differently with herbicide application; however, the combined\
    \ application of TSF and PSC altered soil microbial activity and structure compared\
    \ to their individual application or non-application. The application of GC to\
    \ soil buffered the impact of TSF and PSC on microbial biomass and activity, and\
    \ reduced the shift in the soil microbial structure&lt;/p&gt;"
