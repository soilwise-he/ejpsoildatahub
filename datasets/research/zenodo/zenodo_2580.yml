  title: BASING THE PARAMETERS OF THE BODY OF THE MACHINE THAT PREPARES THE SOIL FOR
    PLANTING VEGETABLES AND POTATOES
  abstract: "<em>In the world, the leading place is occupied by the development and\
    \ use of energy-saving and high-performance machines for soil cultivation and\
    \ preparation for sowing. \u201CIf we take into account that on a global scale,\
    \ the area of land sown with potatoes is 22 million hectares\u201D.</em><em> </em><em>In\
    \ particular, in this direction, it is relevant to carry out targeted scientific\
    \ research on the development of a combined machine and the rationale for the\
    \ technological process of its working bodies, ensuring resource saving in the\
    \ processes of interaction with the soil.</em><em> </em><em>A half-screw body\
    \ was chosen as a pusher shaper of the machine that prepares the soil for planting\
    \ potatoes, and its parameters were theoretically and experimentally justified.</em><em>\
    \ </em><em>The basic principles and methods of classical mechanics, mathematical\
    \ analysis and statistics were used in this study.</em><em> </em><em>According\
    \ to the results of theoretical and experimental studies, in order to ensure the\
    \ required level of foam formation with low energy consumption, the cover width\
    \ of the body should be 200 mm, the minimum height of its tipper and column should\
    \ be 330 mm and 560 mm, and the length of the tipper wing should be in the range\
    \ of 515-545 mm.</em>"
