  title: Fatigue Evaluation on Soil Beam Specimen for Different Percentages of Coir
    Admixtures
  abstract: For the design of pavement structure, the properties of subgrade soil
    play a vital role and should be stable under harsh traffic and climatic conditions.
    Soils generally found in distinguished sites are strong enough to bear the designed
    load of the superstructure or it needs to be strengthened according to the loading
    condition. Soil stabilization is an important aspect to improve the strength of
    soils and bring it up to certain standards as per the engineering projects. As
    the pavement structures are exposed to forces of nature and fatigue loads, their
    durability and stability are of key importance. Fatigue life is the number of
    traffic load cycles corresponding to the failure of the specimen that provides
    a check on the condition of stabilized soil after subjecting it to prolonged adverse
    climatic conditions and repeated application of traffic loads. The present study
    is carried to investigate the durability of clayey soil mixed with different percentages
    of coir fiber. The durability and fatigue behavior of soil beam specimens to traffic
    load simulations are tested through a newly developed fatigue loading mechanism.
    From the tests conducted it was observed that the soil beam specimen treated with
    coir fiber showed increased fatigue life and enhanced strength characteristics
    as compared to one without the coir fiber. The study helps to determine the optimum
    fiber content to be added to the soil to improve the fatigue life under repeated
    traffic loading conditions.
