  title: Strength Characteristics of Oyster Shell Ash and Periwinkle Shell Ash Stabilized
    Lateritic Soil for Pavement Construction
  abstract: '<em>With an aim of contributing to the reduction of the greenhouse gas
    effect resulting from the incorporation of ordinary Portland cement as a binder
    material in construction and to further encourage the building of environmentally
    conscious structures using alternative binders, the strength characteristics of
    oyster shell ash and periwinkle shell ash as environmentally friendly additives
    to lateritic soil for pavement construction was investigated. Naturally occurring
    lateritic soil having a reddish-brown color was obtained from a borrow pit located
    at Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria. The soil sample classified
    as SC and A-7-6 (5) using the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and AASHTO
    system respectively was treated with up to 15% oyster shell ash (OSA) and periwinkle
    shell ash (PSA) blend in a mix ratio of 60%: 40% by dry weight of soil and compacted
    using the West African Standard compaction effort. The results showed that consistency
    limits, compaction characteristics (optimum moisture content; OMC and maximum
    dry density; MDD) as well as strength properties (unconfined compressive strength;
    UCS, California bearing ratio; CBR, and Durability) improved with the addition
    of the OSA-PSA blend treatment. Peak UCS value of 556.44 kN/m<sup>2</sup> at 28-days
    air-curing was recorded at an optimal 9% OSA-PSA blend. Maximum unsoaked and soaked
    CBR values of 53.35% and 32.17% respectively were also recorded at an optimal
    9% OSA-PSA blend. As specified in the Nigerian General Specifications for CBR
    values, the lateritic soil optimally stabilized with 9% OSA-PSA content and compacted
    using the WAS compaction energy can be utilized as a standalone stabilizer for
    fill material used for the rehabilitation of low-volume pavements. Additionally,
    the 9% OSA-PSA optimum blend can also be used as a standalone subgrade/base stabilizer
    during the construction of concrete/interlocked paved walkways. Furthermore, the
    utilization of OSA-PSA additive in the construction industry would significantly
    lead to a reduction in the challenges faced by the indiscriminate disposal of
    these shell wastes into the environment.</em>'
