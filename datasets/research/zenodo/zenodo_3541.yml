  title: Predictive Analysis of IoT Enabled Garden Soil Requirements using Web Services
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Smart gardening plays a key role in both supply and distribution
    of water to the plants. Plants play a key role in providing habitat and food for
    wild animals, human beings and regulate the water cycle. The important parameters
    for the quality and productivity of a plant growth are soil temperature, soil
    moisture, nutrients, humidity and Potential of Hydrogen (PH). Soil moisture is
    the main factor which is most the effective reliable way to increase yielding.
    The main aim of the present research work, is to sense the essentials and fulfil
    the needs of the plants. For the real time practice there are five different garden
    zones such as Patio, Front yard, Back yard, Balcony and Terrace. Switch is used
    to operate the solenoid valve which is instructed by the web server in communication
    with the cloud data base. By physical verification and plant requirements a time
    interval of 4 min was set in the cloud data base. Internet of things (IOT) and
    cloud computing are two complementary technologies which were merged with the
    application specific hardware design enriched with smart sensors collectively
    provides the data which is stored in cloud. The data stored in the cloud database
    is accessed using the web services. Feedback system which is used to send and
    receive the data that can be used for the analysis of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;'
