  title: Review Paper on Study of Black Cotton Soil to Enhancing the Properties of
    Sub Grade and Base Layer of Pavement
  abstract: 'Soil is basic and important element in Civil Engineering field. Stability
    of every structure depends on the type and characteristics of foundation which
    in turn depends on the type of soil. Many problems irrupt if expansive soil, Natural
    soil is to be used in foundation, because of its shrinkage and swelling properties.
    There are many methods to make natural soil stable for various constructions.
    Natural soil is comfortable for road work, compared to other types of soil. Abhishek
