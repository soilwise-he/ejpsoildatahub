  title: Construction of a mathematical model and numerical study of interaction between
    moisture-, heat-, and mass transfer processes of salt solutions in an unsaturated
    soil layer
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Methods of mathematical modeling and computer simulation were
    used to investigate the influence of interrelated processes of transfer of saline
    solutions in the unsaturated soil layer. To this end, a mathematical model has
    been built for modeling the corresponding processes of the moisture-, heat-, and
    mass transfer of saline solutions in an unsaturated soil layer. An effective computational
    algorithm was developed to solve the corresponding nonlinear boundary problem
    numerically by the method of finite differences; it was implemented in the Asp.net
    programming environment in the C++ language. Based on the numerical experiments
    carried out, the distribution of moisture, concentration, and temperature fields
    in the aeration zone (incomplete saturation) was obtained. To study the influence
    of mass transfer of salts on moisture transfer, a numerical solution was found
    to the problem of moisture transfer, the problem of moisture transfer taking into
    consideration mass transfer and moisture transfer, taking into consideration mass
    transfer in the presence of osmosis. Analysis of the results showed that the distribution
    of the concentration of saline solutions over time is slower and more predictable.
    It was established that the distribution of moisture heads increases with depth
    and time when saline solutions fall on the surface of the soil massif. With the
    influence of salt concentration, the distribution of moisture increases with depth
    and time throughout the entire area of moisture transfer by 1&ndash;3&nbsp;%.
    The distribution of moisture heads taking into consideration the concentration
    of salts and osmosis is reduced by 3&ndash;5&nbsp;% compared to the results of
    the problem without taking into consideration the phenomenon of osmosis. The distribution
    of the concentration of saline solutions during moisture transfer and osmosis
    acquires higher values compared to the results without taking osmosis into consideration.
    The established features can be successfully applied to clean the fertile soil
    layer and resume agricultural activities&lt;/p&gt;'
