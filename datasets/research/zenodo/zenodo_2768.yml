  title: Impact of the different sources of mulch on soil chemical properties of an
    Ultisol in Umudike, South East Nigeria
  abstract: "This research was conducted at the Teaching and Research Farm of Abia\
    \ State University Umudike, to evaluate the impact of different sources of mulch\
    \ on soil chemical properties of an Ultisol in Umudike, South East Nigeria. The\
    \ experiment comprised of five (5) treatments namely, Control = 0t/ha, R1 \u2013\
    \ Ricemill waste 10/ha, R2 - Ricemill waste 15/ha, S1 - Sawdust =10t/ha, S2 -\
    \ Sawdust = 15t/ha. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block\
    \ Design (RCBD) with the treatments replicated three (3) times to give a total\
    \ of fifteen (15) plots. Raw data obtained was analyzed using analysis of variance\
    \ (ANOVA) and significant means were separated using Fisher least significant\
    \ difference (F-LSD) at probability level of (P&lt;0.05). The results obtained\
    \ showed that total exchangeable acidity significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced in\
    \ mulched plots compared to the control. Soil pH, available phosphorous, total\
    \ nitrogen, organic carbon and exchangeable cations of mulched plots were significantly\
    \ (P&lt;0.05) higher than the control. Similarly, Effective cation exchange capacity\
    \ (ECEC), percentage base saturation and C: N ratio was significantly (P&lt;0.05)\
    \ higher when compared with the control. Sawdust application at the rate of 15t/ha\
    \ significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased pH, organic carbon, available phosphorous,\
    \ effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), percentage base saturation and C:\
    \ N ratio compared to control and ricemill at 15t/ha. However, Ricemill waste\
    \ at 10t/ha and 15t/ha significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased soil total nitrogen\
    \ and sodium (Na) content compared to control and sawdust at different rates.\
    \ Ricemill waste and sawdust mulch positively influenced soil chemical properties\
    \ and could be recommended for enhancement of soil chemical properties in Umudike\
    \ South East Nigeia"
