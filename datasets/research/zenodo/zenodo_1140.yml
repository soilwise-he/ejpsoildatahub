  title: Bioremediation of a crude oil contaminated soil using water hyacinth (Eichhornia
    crassipes)
  abstract: "Crude oil contamination is a growing environmental concern in most oil\
    \ processing regions of the world. This study assessed the efficacy of powdered\
    \ <em>Eichhornia crassipes</em> (water hyacinth) as potential bio stimulant in\
    \ the remediation of crude oil contaminated soil using three test treatments (20ml,\
    \ 60ml and 100ml) and a control. The remediation process was monitored by assaying\
    \ the total hydrocarbon content (THC) and soil pH of the soil on 16 cells for\
    \ 90 days. However, there was a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in soil pH\
    \ and THC with the introduction of powdered <em>E. crassipes</em> at different\
    \ concentrations. Contaminated soil amended with 40g of <em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>\
    \ had the highest THC loss of (41%), following this was contaminated soil amended\
    \ with 60g of <em>Eichhornia crassipes</em> (31%) on the final day of remediation.\
    \ The total culturable hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria in <em>Eichhornia crassipes\
    \ </em>treated polluted soil increased from 1.4\xD710<sup>6</sup> Cfu/g to 8.2\xD7\
    10<sup>5</sup> Cfu/g while the total culturable hydrocarbon utilizing fungal counts\
    \ in the <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>treatment increased from 1.2 \xD710<sup>4\
    \ </sup>to 4.5 \xD710<sup>4 </sup>Cfu/g from the zero hour to the 90th day of\
    \ the study. The time effect of the remediation process had P-value less than\
    \ 0.05 for 20, 60 and 100ml crude oil contamination signifying that the time factor\
    \ played important role in the remediation process. The use of organic nutrient\
    \ sources such as <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>nutrient powder is of good use\
    \ as source of limiting nutrient needed for bioremediation of crude oil impacted\
    \ medium."
