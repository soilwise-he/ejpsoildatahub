  title: Evaluating Salicornia as a Potential Forage Crop to Remediate High Groundwater-Table
    Saline Soil under Continental Climates
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salicornia&lt;/em&gt; is a leafless C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
    annual halophyte with a greatest economic potential. A field study was conducted
    to evaluate &lt;em&gt;Salicornia&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Salicornia europaea&lt;/em&gt;)
    biomass production and feed quality and its effect on soil quality in the Mediterranean
    Karatas-Adana region of the Southern Turkey. &lt;em&gt;Salicornia&lt;/em&gt; biomass,
    groundwater, and soils were randomly sampled from adjoining Unprotected (uncontrolled
    mixed grazing) and Protected (no grazing) sites. Results showed that the Protected
    site produced a higher amount of total (shoot and root), root, and shoot fresh
    biomass by 22, 45, and 12%, respectively as compared with the Unprotected site.
    Total, root, and shoot dry biomass production was also higher in the Protected
    site. Biomass collected from the Protected site had a significantly lower content
    of acid detergent fiber, but higher content of digestible dry-matter and relative
    feed values than in biomass collected from the Unprotected site. Iron (Fe) and
    zinc (Zn) contents were 1.9 and 1.8 times higher in the Protected site than in
    the Unprotected site. Groundwater and soil electrical conductivities were significantly
    lower in the Protected site than in the Unprotected site. While the soil microbial
    biomass, active carbon, and intermediate C pools were 36, 21 and 56% higher, respectively,
    the specific maintenance respiration rates were lower (by 23%) in the Protected
    site than in the Unprotected site. Results suggested that increased biomass yield
    of &lt;em&gt;Salicornia&lt;/em&gt; with higher feed quality under Protection could
    be used as a forage crop to remediate coastal saline soils with a high water-table.&lt;/p&gt;'
