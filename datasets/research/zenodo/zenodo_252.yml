  title: Preventive remediation methods minimize soil pollution
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil quality is rich in various substances, as well as a rich
    variety of uses for life, which leads to the potential for pollution. Once soils
    are polluted, remediation is mitigative and must be carried out, which has been
    the focus of many studies so far. However, preventive remediation is the focus
    of the novelty of this study, which aims to prepare predictive methods. This is
    a literature review of various studies over the last ten years, which are related
    to soil quality indicators through the respiration process. Based on the soil
    microbial respiration process platform, which contains various substances, the
    results of this study found three preventive remediation methods, namely indicators
    of substance reactants, gas products, and toxicity to microbes. The three methods
    simply require measuring the parameters of biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical
    oxygen demand, in addition to specific measurements of carbon dioxide and microbial
    enumeration. The advantage of the preventive remediation method is the application
    of soil response indicators to various types and amounts of contaminants. The
    implementation of preventive remediation is prior to building infrastructure,
    which is able to predict changes in soil quality through monitoring, thereby minimizing
    the potential for mitigative remediation.&lt;/p&gt;'
