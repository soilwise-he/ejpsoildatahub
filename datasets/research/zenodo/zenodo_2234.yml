  title: Influence of Zn on different fractions of S in soil maintained under field
    capacity moisture regime
  abstract: "Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Orissa University\
    \ of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar-751 003, Odisha, India <em>E-mail</em>\

    \ Mohanpur-741 252, Nadia, West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript received 29 September\
    \ 2016, accepted 13 December 2016</em> A laboratory investigation was conducted\
    \ to study the effect of applied Zn on availability of various fractions of sulphur\
    \ under field capacity moisture regime. The incubation study was conducted with\
    \ 100 g soil with four levels of S (0, 5, 15 and 20 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup>) and\
    \ Zn (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup>). Soil was sampled and analyzed\
    \ at 10, 20, 30 and 60th day of the study period for SO<sub>4</sub>-S, adsorbed\
    \ S, organic S, total S and Zn. It was found that, irrespective of doses of Zn\
    \ and S fertilizers, sulphate sulphur in soils tended to increase significantly\
    \ with increase in the period of incubation. Addition of Zn fertilizer increases\
    \ SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2013</sup>-S content in soils. Adsorbed sulphur tended\
    \ to increase significantly with increase in the period of investigation. However\
    \ on the other hand, organic sulphur tended to decrease significantly with increase\
    \ in the period of incubation. The decrease in organic sulphur with time is due\
    \ to mineralization of this fraction of sulphur which is evidenced by the concomitant\
    \ increase in sulphate and adsorbed sulphur in soils. Total S content slightly\
    \ increased with increase in the dose of S addition. The increase in total S with\
    \ added S fertilizer is due to incorporation of available S to the total sulphur\
    \ pool in soil. Very little variation is recorded in non-sulphate sulphur in soils\
    \ treated either with Zn or S fertilizer. Addition of Zn did not influence non-sulphate\
    \ sulphur content in soils. Addition of sulphur fertilizer increased DTPA-extractable\
    \ Zn in soils. The increment in available Zn is well marked when higher amount\
    \ of S is added along with higher dose of Zn fertilizer."
