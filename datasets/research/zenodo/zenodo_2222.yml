  title: Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Produced by Soil Rare Actinomycetes and Their
    Significant Effect on Aspergillus-derived mycotoxins
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The current investigation addressed the green synthesis of silver
    nanoparticles (AgNPs) using newly isolated silver-resistant rare actinomycetes,
    Glutamicibacter nicotianae SNPRA1 and Leucobacter aridicollis SNPRA2, and investigated
    their impact on the mycotoxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus ATCC 11498 and Aspergillus
    ochraceus ATCC 60532. The formation of AgNPs was evidenced by the reaction&rsquo;s
    color change to brownish and the appearance of the characteristic surface plasmon
    resonance. The transmission electron microscopy of biogenic AgNPs produced by
    G. nicotianae SNPRA1 and L. aridicollis SNPRA2 (designated Gn-AgNPs and La-AgNPs,
    respectively) revealed the generation of monodispersed spherical nanoparticles
    with average sizes of 8.48 &plusmn; 1.72 nm and 9.67 &plusmn; 2.64 nm, respectively.
    Furthermore, the XRD patterns reflected their crystallinity and the FTIR spectra
    demonstrated the presence of proteins as capping agents. Both bioinspired AgNPs
    exhibited a remarkable inhibitory effect on the conidial germination of the investigated
    mycotoxigenic fungi. The bioinspired AgNPs caused an increase in DNA and protein
    leakage, suggesting the disruption of membrane permeability and integrity. Interestingly,
    the biogenic AgNPs completely inhibited the production of total aflatoxins and
    ochratoxin A at concentrations less than 8 &mu;g/mL. At the same time, cytotoxicity
    investigations revealed the low toxicity of the biogenic AgNPs against the human
    skin fibroblast (HSF) cell line. Both biogenic AgNPs exhibited feasible biocompatibility
    with HSF cells at concentrations up to 10 &mu;g/mL and their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;
    values were 31.78 and 25.83 &mu;g/mL for Gn-AgNPs and La-AgNPs, respectively.
    The present work sheds light on the antifungal prospect of the biogenic AgNPs
    produced by rare actinomycetes against mycotoxigenic fungi as promising candidates
    to combat mycotoxin formation in food chains at nontoxic doses.&lt;/p&gt;'
