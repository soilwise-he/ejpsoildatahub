  title: Determination Of Moisture Content In Soil Based On Oven Drying Method Using
    A Microstrip Patch Sensor
  abstract: 'The proposed design is analyzed of a pentagon shape of microstrip sensor
    for determination the soil moisture measurement. The proposed design is useful
    in agricultural field as well as measured the moisture with accuracy and it is
    designed on FR4 substrate with 1.676 thicknesses. Many methods are used for detecting
    the moisture but oven drying method is very cheap and easy to install. A new 2.3
    GHz soil moisture sensor using microstrip transmission line is presented with
    good return loss -28dB and gain 3.2dB. The main advantages of the proposed sensor
    will be its high accuracy, quickness of measurement, low cost and ease of implementation.
    Since the sensor has low power consumption.


    <strong>Motivation/Background:</strong> The microstrip moisture sensor is helpful
    for detecting the moisture content of soil. The proposed patch sensor design is
    being beneficial in real time agricultural field for the determination of soil
    moisture content (MC). The actual moisture content in soil is determined using
    conventional, standard an oven drying method at operating frequency 2.3GHz with
    compact and low cost. The work has done at frequency range between 1GHz to 2GHz
    for detecting the soil moisture by using the cavity resonator technique and impedance
    bridge technique. These techniques are expensive, complex, no more accuracy and
    time consuming.


    <strong>Method:</strong> The proposed design has fabricated on FR4 substrate with
    1.676mm thickness. The simulation analysis has carried out with the help of CST
    software and the experimental values will be measured by vector network analyzer.
    The experiment will be performed on the samples of soil and the results shows
    that the proposed method will be able to detect the high moisture content with
    high sensitivity and accuracy.


    <strong>Results:</strong> The proposed design, it will be very helpful for agricultural
    field because of got the good return loss as well as gain -28dB and 3.2dB at 2.3GHz
    and it can be fabricated and measured by the vector network analyzer


    Conclusions: The proposed design is analyzed for detecting the moisture content
    with the suitable parameters with the help of CST software as well as used the
    direct (oven drying) method, this is very easy and less time consuming.'
