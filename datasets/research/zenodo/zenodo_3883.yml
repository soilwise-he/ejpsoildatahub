  title: Pollution Induced Community Tolerance(Pict) Of Microorganisms In Soil Incubated
    With Different Levels Of Pb
  abstract: "Soil microbial activity is adversely affected by pollutants such as heavy\
    \ metals, antibiotics and pesticides. Organic amendments including sewage sludge,\
    \ municipal compost and vermicompost are recently used to improve soil structure\
    \ and fertility. But, these materials contain heavy metals including Pb, Cd, Zn,\
    \ Ni and Cu that are toxic to soil microorganisms and may lead to occurrence of\
    \ more tolerant microbes. Among these, Pb is the most abundant and has more negative\
    \ effect on soil microbial ecology. In this study, Pb levels of 0, 100, 200, 300,\
    \ 400 and 500 mg Pb [as Pb(NO3)2] per kg soil were added to the pots containing\
    \ 2 kg of a loamy soil and incubated for 6 months at 25\xB0C with soil moisture\
    \ of - 0.3 MPa. Dehydrogenase activity of soil as a measure of microbial activity\
    \ was determined on 15, 30, 90 and 180 days after incubation. Triphenyl tetrazolium\
    \ chloride (TTC) was used as an electron acceptor in this assay. PICTs (\u20AC\
    IC50 values) were calculated for each Pb level and incubation time. Soil microbial\
    \ activity was decreased by increasing Pb level during 30 days of incubation but\
    \ the induced tolerance appeared on day 90 and thereafter. During 90 to 180 days\
    \ of incubation, the PICT was gradually developed by increasing Pb level up to\
    \ 200 mg kg-1, but the rate of enhancement was steeper at higher concentrations."
