  - '&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Soil pollution has a strong impact when oil activity takes place within
    a savanna ecosystem. Any oil spill affects agricultural soils. Biostimulation
    with orange peel extract (Citrus sinensis) is an alternative for remediation of
    soil contaminated with crude oil and in this research the corn plant (Zea mays)
    was used as a biomarker of contamination level of a savanna soil after their treatment.
    Three samples of savannah soil contaminated with oil light crude were treated
    with dissolutions 1, 3 and 5% of extract of orange peel in water at a dose of
    150 mL per kg of soil treated. The content of oils and fats was measured every
    7 days, up to 42 days. Corn seeds were planted in soil samples, their growth was
    measured every 5 days for a period of 35 consecutive days, comparing their growth
    with seeds planted in a soil sample without contamination. According to an analysis
    of rank contrast, the plant growth was statistically the same in all samples up
    to 20 days; from there, evident differences regarding the pattern were shown.&lt;/p&gt;'
