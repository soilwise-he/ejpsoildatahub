  title: Nonlinear Finite Element Modeling Of Deep Beam Resting On Linear And Nonlinear
    Random Soil
  abstract: "An accuracy nonlinear analysis of a deep beam resting on elastic perfectly\
    \ plastic soil is carried out in this study. In fact, a nonlinear finite element\
    \ modeling for large deflection and moderate rotation of Euler-Bernoulli beam\
    \ resting on linear and nonlinear random soil is investigated. The geometric nonlinear\
    \ analysis of the beam is based on the theory of von K\xE0rm\xE0n, where the Newton-Raphson\
    \ incremental iteration method is implemented in a Matlab code to solve the nonlinear\
    \ equation of the soil-beam interaction system. However, two analyses (deterministic\
    \ and probabilistic) are proposed to verify the accuracy and the efficiency of\
    \ the proposed model where the theory of the local average based on the Monte\
    \ Carlo approach is used to analyze the effect of the spatial variability of the\
    \ soil properties on the nonlinear beam response. The effect of six main parameters\
    \ are investigated: the external load, the length of a beam, the coefficient of\
    \ subgrade reaction of the soil, the Young's modulus of the beam, the coefficient\
    \ of variation and the correlation length of the soil's coefficient of subgrade\
    \ reaction. A comparison between the beam resting on linear and nonlinear soil\
    \ models is presented for different beam's length and external load. Numerical\
    \ results have been obtained for the combination of the geometric nonlinearity\
    \ of beam and material nonlinearity of random soil. This comparison highlighted\
    \ the need of including the material nonlinearity and spatial variability of the\
    \ soil in the geometric nonlinear analysis, when the beam undergoes large deflections."
