  title: Chemical fractionation and distribution of metals in contaminated urban soil
    in Zhuzhou City, South Central China
  abstract: "Institute of Environmental Engineering, School of Metallurgy and Environment,\
    \ Central South University,<br> Changsha 410083, China<br> <em>E-mail </em>: banerjeesme@csu.edu.cn<br>\
    \ <em>Manuscript received online 20 April 2016, revised 23 August 2016, accepted\
    \ 24 August 2016</em> The present study was conducted to determine the chemical\
    \ fractions of heavy metals, to assess the current and potential environmental\
    \ risks and to evaluate the mobility and bioavailability of metals in contaminated\
    \ urban soils. Sequential extraction procedure was applied to fractionate the\
    \ metal content into exchangeable fraction, carbonate fraction, fraction bound\
    \ to Fe-Mn oxides, fraction bound to organic matter and residual fraction. Chemical\
    \ speciation (Tessier, 1979) study revealed that Cd in soil prevails mostly in\
    \ exchangeable fractions (26.383%). The overall percentage of metal content in\
    \ different sequential fractions is in the sequence of Residual &gt; Organic &gt;\
    \ Fe-Mn Oxides &gt; Carbonate \u2248 Exchangeable and the order of metals in each\
    \ fractions are as follows \u2013 Exchangeable : Cd &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; As, Carbonate\
    \ : Cd &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; As, FeMn Oxides : Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Cu &gt; As, Organic\
    \ : As &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Cd and Residual : As &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cd. Elemental\
    \ concentrations from each sequential extraction step were measured using inductively\
    \ coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, IRIS Intrepid II XSP,\
    \ USA). The pH value of the soils in the study area ranged from 6.44 to 7.05 (mean\
    \ 6.67), indicating an acidic to neutral type of surface soils. The eco-toxicological\
    \ assessment of the studied soil using the mobility factor indices revealed the\
    \ following sequence : Cd (40.627) &gt; Pb (14.941) \u2265 Cu (14.399) &gt; As\
    \ (5.377). Mobility factor indices for soil metals revealed a high environmental\
    \ contamination risk for Cd, which indicates a serious environmental threat."
