  title: SPECIFIC FEATURES OF SOIL FORMATION IN THE CASE ZONE UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS
  abstract: <em>The work considers the processes of soil formation, taking into account
    hydrothermal and biological factors, taking into account local conditions. It
    has been established that the process of weathering, as the first stage of soil
    formation in natural conditions, proceeds with a close occurrence of the groundwater
    level and a compensated hydrothermal regime.</em>
