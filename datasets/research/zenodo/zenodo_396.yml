  title: Soil-Borne Pests in Urban Agricultural Areas.
  abstract: "Cities are living spaces where population, production, and consumption\
    \ are concentrated, and at the same time, they are residential areas with a certain\
    \ population in terms of human relations, where the physiological, economic, social,\
    \ and cultural needs can be met in societies are met at certain levels (\u0130\
    sbir &amp; A\xE7ma, 2002). Agriculture is a comprehensive word for providing food\
    \ and other products to sustain the human population, from crop plants to domestic\
    \ animals (Harris &amp; Fuller, 2014). Urban agriculture, on the other hand, is\
    \ defined as \"the cultivation, processing, and distribution of food and other\
    \ products through intensive plant cultivation and animal husbandry\" in and around\
    \ the city, as a concept that encompasses forms of \"subsistence production and\
    \ processing, from processing at the household level to commercialized agriculture.\"\
    \ Entertainment and leisure activities that can serve different purposes, commercial\
    \ enterprises that will bring economic vitality, use of space to achieve individual\
    \ well-being and social health and welfare, landscape works, environmental restoration,\
    \ and improvement are some of the urban agriculture activities (Philips, 2013).\
    \ When all these recipes are combined, in addition to the benefits that agriculture\
    \ produces and processes food, contributes to the natural resources of cities,\
    \ provides food security, entertainment, and education for citizens, it also contributes\
    \ to the solution of economic, environmental and social problems in cities (Kayas\xFC\
    \ &amp; Durmaz, 2021). With the global pandemic process, the concept of urban\
    \ agriculture has become even more important in terms of food safety, access to\
    \ food, and ecosystem maintenance for humans and animals. With this global epidemic\
    \ we are still experiencing, the importance of nature and healthy life has been\
    \ better understood. The most important thing created by the pandemic process\
    \ is the major challenge is access to economically accessible, fresh, and nutritional\
    \ food for the growing population (Lal, 2020). Therefore, the factor that epidemics,\
    \ disasters and wars, etc. indicate is that the \"agricultural sector\" has an\
    \ important place in countries' economic policies. (Ak\u0131n et al., 2020). In\
    \ terms of environmental quality and ecosystem, urban agriculture, it contributes\
    \ to the city's sustainability by maintaining biological diversity, reducing heat\
    \ islands and carbon emissions in cities, increasing the city's air quality, and\
    \ utilizing urban waste and wastewater (Tando\u011Fan &amp; \xD6zdamar, 2022).\
    \ As the years go by, it will be inevitable for the population to increase, the\
    \ limited resources to decrease, and, as a result, the environmental problems\
    \ to increase. Therefore, these activities will increase, especially in megacities\
    \ that are the centers of activities such as tourism, trade, industry, and agricultural\
    \ production, and more undesirable negative pressure will occur on the environment.\
    \ The increasing number of people living in cities and the resulting rapid urbanization\
    \ bring about undesirable environmental problems. It is a known fact that today,\
    \ most of the natural resources are consumed in cities due to the population.\
    \ As a result, fertile lands, food, clean water, and clean air are gradually decreasing,\
    \ and the world is rapidly approaching a state of famine (Kayas\xFC &amp; Durmaz,\
    \ 2021). Especially in developing countries, cities are expanding rapidly, so\
    \ the proportion of people living in cities is increasing rapidly. In our country,\
    \ due to migration from villages to cities in recent years, high population density\
    \ in urban areas and heavy vehicle traffic for industry, agriculture, and transportation\
    \ causes water, soil, and air pollution. Among these, climate change stands out\
    \ as the biggest ecological problem of our age on a global basis, and the negativities\
    \ it creates are better understood day by day. As a result of greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ resulting from energy, industry, and related wastes, urban and conventional\
    \ agricultural activities on the earth, the climate crisis is causing the climate\
    \ crisis to reach increasingly dire situations. In the future, food security and\
    \ climate change discussions will continue to be critical issues to be considered.\
    \ Bulkeley (2010) states that cities are responsible for approximately 75 percent\
    \ of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions, and Hoornweg et al. (2011)\
    \ reported that more than 80 percent of total emissions may originate from activities\
    \ carried out in cities. The effects of regime change in climates and the problems\
    \ caused by these effects continue to negatively affect human and environmental\
    \ health and the social dynamics of societies and economies. This situation will\
    \ continue to increase exponentially over the years. Therefore, one of the biggest\
    \ problems for humanity is ensuring food security in this deteriorating ecological\
    \ environment. Otherwise, it will affect all processes of agricultural products\
    \ from field to table. Thus, significant problems will arise for food processing,\
    \ storage, transportation, and consumption. It has been reported that by 2050,\
    \ food prices may increase between 3% and 84% due to climate change (Porter et\
    \ al., 2014). As a result, the risk of contamination with heavy metals increases\
    \ as a result of the increased use of chemical products in the production of energy\
    \ and industrial products. In order to obtain more products from unit areas, the\
    \ problem of more pollution of soil, water, and air to be used in agricultural\
    \ activities will increase. Thus, pollution risks from chemical pesticides and\
    \ fertilizers will increase in areas where urban agriculture is carried out. Using\
    \ chemical fertilizers in agricultural areas is one of the most important activities\
    \ that cause greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Bah\xE7eci (2019)\
    \ reported that fertilizer use decreased considering the urban gardening example\
    \ Istanbul data. In the same study, it was stated that this result, on the one\
    \ hand, means a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 2.7 to 21.3\
    \ million kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year, and on the other hand, it\
    \ means health and sustainable food. For these reasons, measures need to be taken\
    \ to reduce the negative effects of chemicals in these areas on health and the\
    \ environment. In summary, measures must be taken to increase people's awareness\
    \ levels to reduce health and environmental risks in urban agriculture. The products\
    \ produced in urban gardens, which are increasing daily, must be protected against\
    \ harmful pests. Due to the polluted nature of these areas and the resulting decrease\
    \ in species diversity, products in production areas are more susceptible to problems.\
    \ Therefore, to minimize product losses due to pests in urban agricultural areas,\
    \ it is first necessary to have information about agricultural pests that may\
    \ occur in the plants grown. There are many pests on cultivated plants in areas\
    \ where agricultural activities are carried out. Among these, species known as\
    \ underground pests have an essential place. These pests are among the most important\
    \ problems that limit the production of cultivated plants in urban areas. Critical\
    \ factors such as soil type, soil moisture, and rainfall amount determine the\
    \ extent of damage caused by subsoil pests and their distribution (Nyamwasa et\
    \ al., 2018). Additionally, outbreaks may be associated with pest responses to\
    \ temperature changes. This may increase the number of annual generations or extend\
    \ the breeding season of pests (Kiritani, 2012; Kroschel et al., 2016), both of\
    \ which can lead to severe crop losses (Nyamwasa et al., 2018). Apart from these\
    \ environmental factors, some other factors are effective in causing these pests\
    \ to be a problem. Several agricultural practices, including crop rotation, solarization,\
    \ appropriate tillage, autumn tillage, use of clean materials, resistant plant\
    \ varieties, grafted plant material, mulching, planting of trap plants, use of\
    \ non-soil material, planting timing, and source removal, can reduce their population\
    \ densities. It affects. Uncultivated soils close to production areas serve as\
    \ an essential source of contamination for soil-borne pests in cultivated areas.\
    \ Because these areas are not developed, they are rich in vegetation and provide\
    \ suitable environments for developing these pests. Additionally, a production\
    \ area's history is a critical factor in identifying potential soil-borne insect\
    \ problems. Because of the color of the leaves of some plants, their smell, and\
    \ plant-specific characteristics such as pollen can attract some insects. Therefore,\
    \ the number of species and population density in an area depends on the vegetation\
    \ present in previous years. In the case of preferred plants, they lay eggs there\
    \ and continue to live in the soil, feeding on plant roots. When plant diversity\
    \ increases, especially when weeds are not controlled, the more narrow and broad-leaved\
    \ plant species there are, the more soil-borne pest species and numbers there\
    \ will be. Although it is prevented by pest and disease control methods, 30-40%\
    \ of the produced products are lost every year due to their effects on agricultural\
    \ products. (Alimuhammedov &amp; Khujaev, 1991; Caballero et al., 1991; Arthi\
    \ et al., 2019; Khudoykulov et al., 2021). In some areas, the main pests that\
    \ cause these losses are soil-borne pests. If left uncontrolled, these pests can\
    \ destroy 60-70% of vegetable crops over years of mass proliferation, especially\
    \ 25-30% of newly planted potatoes with balls (Khudoykulov et al., 2021). Soil-borne\
    \ pests cause a significant decrease in yield and deterioration in product quality.\
    \ These underground pests have been reported to be the main pests of all vegetable\
    \ and potato crops in Central Asia and Europe (Alimuhammedov &amp; Khujaev, 2020\
    \ ). So, why do these pests appear more of a threat in production areas? Because\
    \ these pests feed on the roots and tubers of plants in the soil. Here, the damage\
    \ it causes can go unnoticed and thus significantly affects the plant's growth\
    \ and ultimately affects the productivity of the crop. Therefore, the damage to\
    \ the product is noticed only after it is done. Another reason is that these generally\
    \ damage the plant in the early period, that is, in the sensitive period, causing\
    \ the plant to dry out or cause problems in its development. The success of chemical\
    \ control is not as high as it is for above-ground pests. Because it is difficult\
    \ to deliver a lethal dose of pesticide to the pest in the soil, another critical\
    \ problem is the transmission of diseases from underground soil. As a result,\
    \ efficiency and the resulting product quality decrease. To protect the quantity\
    \ and quality of the products produced in urban agriculture, it is essential to\
    \ recognize these pests that damage plants and to have some basic information\
    \ about their fight against them. The best way to determine whether these soil-dwelling\
    \ pest species are causing problems in urban farming areas is to examine the roots\
    \ of the plants and look for damage. To do this, it is necessary to find the pests\
    \ in question by digging the bottoms of damaged seedlings or the areas with weak\
    \ plants opened between the rows. On aboveground plant parts, most of these pests\
    \ cause similar symptoms, such as the presence of sparse vegetation in the cultivated\
    \ field or the row and wilted or weak plants that have not developed. It is imperative\
    \ to find solutions using new technologies to improvise and solve such problems\
    \ faced by producers in agriculture (Arthi et al., 2019). Recently, remote sensing\
    \ has significantly contributed to detecting and controlling many diseases and\
    \ pests. However, the visibility and monitoring of soil-borne pests during the\
    \ young period, which is the critical growth stage of crops, remains a significant\
    \ concern. Playing seeds before planting against these pests in areas with intense\
    \ damage is essential. In the later development period of the plant, only after\
    \ the roots are entirely damaged and rotted, the color of the parts of the plant\
    \ above the ground changes, and growth retardation occurs. Thus, significant product\
    \ losses occur. For this reason, new approaches have recently been tried in the\
    \ fight against underground pests to solve these problems. One of these is to\
    \ detect the presence of pests in the soil using a thermal sensor device and to\
    \ destroy the pest by applying pesticide directly with the warning of the related\
    \ system (Arthi et al., 2019). The mechanism here is primarily that the soil maintains\
    \ a certain thermal level range. Larvae in the ground have different thermal levels;\
    \ hence, the thermal level will be higher than the average temperature level of\
    \ the soil where the grubs or worms are located. The problem can be solved by\
    \ spraying a sufficient amount of pesticide on the affected area, depending on\
    \ the difference in temperature levels. The problem caused by species that damage\
    \ plants increases every year. Important soil-borne insects that cause damage\
    \ in areas where agricultural production is carried out are sapling bottomworms,\
    \ June and May beetle larvae, wireworms, turnip moths, fly grubs, mole crickets,\
    \ termites, crickets, etc."
