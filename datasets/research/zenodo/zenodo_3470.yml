  title: Numerical Assessment of Squeezed Branch Pile in Silty Clay Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Squeezed Branch Pile is derived on the basis of caste in place
    concrete pile. It has one or more branches along the pile shaft at design depth.
    Squeezed branch piles are often used in high rise building, transmission tower
    and in other pile foundations where anticipated uplift or vertical load may cause
    failure. This pile is one of the excellent options of pile foundation for soft
    soil and silty soil. The behaviour of Squeezed Branch pile is difficult to explain
    using simple pile-soil theories or two dimensional numerical analyses because
    of complicated geometry of pile.In the present numerical analysis, a 3D pile-soil
    model of conventional circular pile and squeezed branch pile foundations are analysed
    using MIDAS GTS NX finite element software to find out effectiveness of squeezed
    branch pile over conventional pile. The aim is to study the performance of Squeezed
    Branch Pile foundation in silty clay with respect to various parameters such as
    types of loading, branch diameter, branch spacing and number of branches. Analysis
    shows that the squeezed branch pile has higher vertical, lateral and uplift load
    capacity as compared to conventional pile.&lt;/p&gt;'
