  title: Use Of Pigeon Pea (Cajanus Cajan L) As Soil Amendment For The Growth, Leaf
    Chemical Composition And Yield Of White Yam (Dioscorea Rotundata L)
  abstract: "An experiment was carried out to investigate the use of pigeon pea (<em>Cajanus\
    \ cajan</em>) as soil amendment for the growth and yield of white yam (<em>Discorea\
    \ rotundata L</em>) between 1999 and 2002 at Akure in the rainforest zone of Nigeria.\n\
    \n \n\nThere were four treatments namely; NPK 15 -15 -15 fertilizer applied at\
    \ 300kg/ha, poultry manure at 6t/ha, pigeon pea planted at two seeds per hole\
    \ at spacing of 1m x 0.5m between rows of yam plots (soil amendment) and a control\
    \ (no fertilizer).  The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block\
    \ design (RCB) and replicated five times.  The initial soil status before planting\
    \ was analyzed and each plot size is 4m x 4m (16m<sup>2</sup>).\n\n \n\nThe growth\
    \ parameters recorded for the yam were vine length (cm), leaf population and stem\
    \ girth (cm).  At harvest, yam tuber weight (kg), tuber length (cm), tuber girth,\
    \ root length and seed yield of pigeon pea plants were determined.  Leaf and soil\
    \ N, P, K, Ca, Mg, pH and Organic matter  contents were also analyzed at the end\
    \ of the experiment.\n\n \n\nThe results showed that there were significant (p&gt;0.05)\
    \ increases in the vine length, leaf population, stem girth, tuber weight, tuber\
    \ length, tuber girth, soil and leaf N,\n\nP, K, Ca, Mg, pH and O. M of white\
    \ yam cultivated under the different fertilizer treatments compared to the control\
    \ treatment.\n\n \n\nPigeon pea plants used as soil amendment increased yam tuber\
    \ weight, tuber girth and tuber length by 29.4%, 14.5% and 24.02% respectively\
    \ compared to NPK fertilizer. While poultry manure increased the same yield parameters\
    \ by 84%, 68.60% and 89% compared to control treatment respectively.\n\n \n\n\
    Pigeon pea plants used as soil amendment also increased the soil pH, O.M, K, Ca\
    \ and Mg by 28%, 30%, 95% and 89% respectively compared to the NPK fertilizer\
    \ treatment.  In-addition pigeon plants produced 2600kg/ha of edible seeds (2.6t/ha)\
    \ which gave it a great comparative advantage over the use of poultry manure and\
    \ NPK fertilizer as soil amendment."
