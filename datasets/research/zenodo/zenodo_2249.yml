  title: 'ETC/ULS Report 02/2018: Land cover changes and soil functions, an approach
    for integrated accounting'
  abstract: "his report is the outcome of a study that was executed during the past\
    \ five years by the EEA and ETC/ULS with support from EIONET (NRCs land use and\
    \ spatial planning) and the European Soil Data Centre of DG JRC. The analysis\
    \ represents the first attempt to assess land use efficiency at a European scale.\
    \ Several new data sets relating specifically to soil functions, were published\
    \ only recently, and this made assessment possible. A key aim of this work was\
    \ to study land cover changes and their positive or negative impacts on soil functions,\
    \ and to obtain a disaggregated hotspot analysis and an overall balance of those\
    \ impacts on soil functions. The report follows a logical flow. Chapter 1 provides\
    \ an introduction to the context of the study. It lays out a framework by giving\
    \ information on the status of land and soil in the context of land resource efficiency,\
    \ listing the most relevant current global and European policies, and introducing\
    \ the concepts of soil function and land multi-functionality. Chapter 2 provides\
    \ details of the study\u2019s input data, in particular the land cover flows as\
    \ well as the pan-European soil function data, further explains the concept of\
    \ multi-functionality and introduces the impact evaluation matrix. The combined\
    \ presentation of land processes and soil functions is the major topic in Chapter\
    \ 3, whereas Chapter 4 then focuses on the impacts of a number of selected, sector-related\
    \ land processes on several of the soil functions. The latter also identifies\
    \ a number of hotspot regions at the NUTS 3 level in which the potential of soils\
    \ to provide certain functions might be substantially affected. At the end of\
    \ the report, Chapter 5 provides information on the balance of impacts, by looking\
    \ at the predominantly positive and predominantly negative impacts to assess the\
    \ overall situation in Europe, but also at national and regional level. Finally,\
    \ Chapter 6 identifies the implications of the analysis for land governance and\
    \ attempts to shed light on the status of land resource efficiency in Europe."
