  title: Content of Cd, Cr and Pb in Soil and Amaranthus caudatus Grown in Yamaltu-Deba
    Local Government Area, Gombe State, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The concentrations of some heavy metals (Cd, Cr and Pb) were
    determined in top soil and (&lt;em&gt;Amaranthus caudatus&lt;/em&gt;) samples
    from irrigated farmlands in Yamaltu, Gombe State, Nigeria, using Atomic Absorption
    Spectrophotometer (AAS). The results show that the heavy metals contents were
    higher in the soil than in the amaranths. The results also revealed the trend
    in soil metals concentration as Cd &gt; Pb &gt; Cr and for the plant as Cd &gt;
    Cr &gt; Pb. Transfer factors (TF) decreased in the following order: Cd &gt; Pb
    &gt; Cr respectively. The levels of toxic metals are within the tolerable levels
    except for Cd in &lt;em&gt;Amaranthus caudatus&lt;/em&gt; which are higher than
    the Indian Standard recommended values (1.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) for
    human consumption. The high level of Cd place the consumers of this vegetable
    crop grown within the area at health risk with time unless an urgent step is taken
    to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;'
