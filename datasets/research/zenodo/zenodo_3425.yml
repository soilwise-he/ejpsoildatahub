  title: Influence of Pseudomonas and Bacillus Strains Isolated from Lolium perenne
    Rhizospheric Soil in Vojvodina (Serbia) on Planth Growth and Soil Microbial Communities
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was the isolation of Pseudomonas sp. and
    Bacillus sp. strains from rhizospheric soil and monitoring the impact of two isolates
    denoted as P12 (Pseudomonas sp.) and B1 (Bacillus sp.) on the parameters of English
    ryegrass (Lolium perenne) yield and activity of the soil microbial communities.
    During 2012&ndash;2014, a plot experiment was set up following the randomized
    block system. Better effect on the plant growth was recorded with the use of Pseudomonas
    sp. P12 isolate than with Bacillus sp. B1. Positive effect on the increase in
    the total number of microorganisms, aminoheterotrophs and azotobacter was also
    achieved. Bacillus sp. B1 increased only the number of actimycetes. Both isolates
    positively affected dehydrogenase activity (DHA).&lt;/p&gt;'
