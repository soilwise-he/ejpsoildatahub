  title: Application of Remote Sensing Techniques to Discriminate the Effect of Different
    Soil Management Treatments over Rainfed Vineyards in Chianti Terroir
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The work aimed to discriminate among different soil management treatments
    in terms of&lt;br&gt;

    beneficial effects by high-resolution thermal and spectral vegetation imagery
    using an unmanned&lt;br&gt;

    aerial vehicle and open-source GIS software. Five soil management treatments were
    applied in&lt;br&gt;

    two organic vineyards (cv. Sangiovese) from Chianti Classico terroir (Tuscany,
    Italy) during two&lt;br&gt;

    experimental years. The treatments tested consisted of conventional tillage, spontaneous
    vegetation,&lt;br&gt;

    pigeon bean (Vicia faba var. minor Beck) incorporated in spring, mixture of barley
    (Hordeum vulgare&lt;br&gt;

    L.) and clover (Trifolium squarrosum L.) incorporated or left as dead mulch in
    late spring. The&lt;br&gt;

    images acquired remotely were analyzed through map-algebra and map-statistics
    in QGIS and&lt;br&gt;

    correlated with field ecophysiological measurements. The surface temperature,
    crop water stress&lt;br&gt;

    index (CWSI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each vine row
    under treatments&lt;br&gt;

    were compared based on frequency distribution functions and statistics descriptors
    of position. The&lt;br&gt;

    spectral vegetation and thermal-based indices were significantly correlated with
    the respective leaf&lt;br&gt;

    area index (R2 = 0.89) and stem water potential measurements (R2 = 0.59), and
    thus are an expression&lt;br&gt;

    of the crop vigor and water status. The gravel and active limestone soil components
    determined&lt;br&gt;

    the spatial variability of vine biophysical (e.g., canopy vigor) and physiological
    characteristics (e.g.,&lt;br&gt;

    vine chlorophyll content) in both farms. The vine canopy surface temperature,
    and CWSI were lower&lt;br&gt;

    on the spontaneous and pigeon bean treatments in both farms, thus evidencing less
    physiological&lt;br&gt;

    stress on the vine rows derived from the cover crop residual effect. In conclusion,
    the proposed&lt;br&gt;

    methodology showed the capacity to discriminate across soil management practices
    and map the&lt;br&gt;

    spatial variability within vineyards. The methodology could serve as a simple
    and non-invasive tool&lt;br&gt;

    for precision soil management in rainfed vineyards to guide producers on using
    the most efficient&lt;br&gt;

    and profitable practice.&lt;/p&gt;'
