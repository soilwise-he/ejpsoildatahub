  title: A Study of Iron Concretions in Lateritic Soil of West Bengal
  abstract: "University College of Agriculture, Calcutta University, Calcutta\xB7\
    \ 700 019 Iron concretions of various sizes are present in lateritic soils of\
    \ West Bengal. The soils are acidic and free iron oxides are present abundantly.\
    \ From analysis of the outer iron coating and the inner core of the concretions\
    \ it appears that these have formed by leaching down of iron and manganese in\
    \ the reduced state and their deposition in concentric lamination over a nucleus\
    \ which is either a particle of quartz or parent material. Alternate wet and dry\
    \ seasons that prevail is an essential condition for formation of these iron concretions."
