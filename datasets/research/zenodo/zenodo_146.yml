  title: Soil micronutrients and their functions
  abstract: Most of the nutrients required for plant growth come from the soil. But
    to some extent, this nutrient requirement of crops can be meet by chemical fertilizers,
    green manures, manures, compost, crop rotation, inclusion of leguminous crops
    etc. It is necessary to have scientific information about the quantity, form,
    availability of major nutrients in the soil and also the method, quantity, etc.
    of chemical fertilizers. A total of 17 different nutrients are required for proper
    growth of crops. An element is essential if a plant cannot complete its life cycle
    without it, if no other element can perform the same function, and if it is directly
    involved in nutrition. An essential nutrient required by the plant in large amounts
    is called a macronutrient, while one required in very small amounts is termed
    a micronutrient. Missing or inadequate supplies of nutrients adversely affect
    plant growth, leading to stunted growth, slow growth, chlorosis, or cell death.
    About half the essential nutrients are micronutrients such as boron, chlorine,
    manganese, iron, zinc, copper, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, and sodium. These
    nutrients are secondary nutrients and called as micronutrients. The present research
    topic gathers several studies that focus on the beneficial role of micronutrients
    in plant nutrition, while aiming at the same time to set the borderlines between
    excessive use and deficiencies in plant development.
