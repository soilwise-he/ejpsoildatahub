  title: The Cation Exchange Capacity, pH of Soil in Mwogo   Marshland, and the Rice
    Plantation in Huye District -Rwanda
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>Agriculture\
    \ is a major component of Rwanda\u2019s national economy. In 2017, agriculture\
    \ contributed 33% to the country\u2019s GDP. About 66.46 % of population, of which\
    \ 50.9 % are women, depends either directly or indirectly on agriculture for living.\
    \  The average arable surface area available is about 0.60 ha per household use.\
    \ This causes overexploitation of available land which is often accompanied by\
    \ agricultural malpractices with disastrous consequences on land resources and\
    \ on environment in general. Given the limited availability of arable land for\
    \ agriculture and the constantly growing food requirements of the population,\
    \ ensuring food security poses a major challenge. </em><em>This present study\
    \ aimed at investigating the cation exchange capacity and pH of soil of Mwogo\
    \ Marshaland in order to   </em><em>resolving the problem of soil fertility of\
    \ Mwogo marshland by looking the method for increasing its fertility and then\
    \ the problem of low rice production.</em><em> By using soil Auger, samples were\
    \ taken randomly in the field where each sample of soil was used in laboratory\
    \ to determine both pH and Cation Exchange Capacity, in each blocks namely Block\
    \ du Nord and Block du Sud. During this study the laboratory results</em><em>\
    \ and laboratory analysis has shown that marshland soil is very acidity with pHkcl\
    \ is 4.37, Ph water with a weak cation exchange capacity.  </em><em>These findings\
    \ support the previous studies showing that the soils with those properties need</em><em>\
    \ particular management; like liming, addition of organic matter, and so on, in\
    \ order to adjust its chemical properties.</em>"
