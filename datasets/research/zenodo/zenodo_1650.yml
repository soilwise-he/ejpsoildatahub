    \ OF CHHATTISGARH IN INDIA"
  abstract: <strong>Abstract </strong> <em>The mineralogical analyses of soil around
    NMDC Dantewada, India are depicted in this report. Various physical and chemical
    analyses were performed on this soil sample. The properties of soil clay minerals
    were studied using a traditional X-ray diffraction spectrum. It is possible to
    extract information from the reflected wave that can be used to measure dielectric
    characteristics. The chemical composition and physical qualities of a material
    determine its dielectric properties. Soil samples were collected from NMDC Dantewada
    district agricultural zone. The dielectric constant of soil increases slowly as
    the moisture content of the soil increases. The X-ray diffraction spectrum revealed
    the presence of clay minerals in the soils, but the other spectrum revealed no
    indication of their presence. X-ray diffraction has a superior resolution, compactness,
    and scanning range than the traditional approach. As a result, it appeared to
    be a better fit for agricultural soil spectroscopic research.</em>
