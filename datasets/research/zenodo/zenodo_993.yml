  title: Impact of Irrigation Water Quality On Biogenicity And Soil Assimilation Potential
  abstract: One of the main pollutants of the soil cover in arid zones is irrigation
    water, which is formed from river systems, mainly the rivers Kura and Araz. When
    using these waters, the soils are polluted with organic and inorganic substances.
    These waters reduce the biogeneity of soils and their assimilation potential with
    respect to organic contaminants hydrocarbons and resticides.
