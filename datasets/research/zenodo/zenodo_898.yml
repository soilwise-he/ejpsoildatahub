  title: PRELIMINARY DISPLACEMENT-BASED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR BUILDINGS ON LIQUEFIED
    SOIL
  abstract: 'This paper provides a simple preliminary procedure for estimating the
    performance of a building on liquefiable soil. The procedure directly accounts
    for damage related to ground shaking and in-directly accounts for settlements.
    Additionally, it also considers the change in shaking demand and changes to the
    natural vibration modes of the systems due to liquefaction. The proposed procedure
    makes use of a displacement-based assessment procedure that considers nonlinear
    soil-foundation-structure interaction and extends it to include the effects of
    liquefaction. The extensions rely on several assumptions about the behaviour of
    the soil, site response and the structure, which require further research to improve
    the robustness of the assessment. Two small studies are conducted: one explores
    at what time the peak displacement of a system occurs during shaking, and the
    second explores the potential changes in site amplification due to liquefaction,
    which provide some justification to the proposed assumptions for the procedure.
    The procedure is applied to a six-storey two-bay case study reinforced concrete
    frame building to demonstrate the influence of various effects of liquefaction.
    For the case study building, the role of shaking damage was large and the estimated
    reduction in shaking demand was important to the estimated level of ductility
    demand, highlighting the importance of quantifying the expected site response
    for the assessment of building performance.'
