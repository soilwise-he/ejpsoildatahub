  title: Unassisted establishment of biological soil crusts on dryland road slopes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Understanding patterns of habitat natural recovery after human-made
    disturbances is critical for theconservation of ecosystems under high environmental
    stress, such as drylands. In particular, the unassisted estab-lishment of nonvascular
    plants such as biological soil crusts or biocrust communities (e.g., soil lichens,
    mossesand cyanobacteria) in newly formed habitats is not yet fully understood.
    However, the potential of biocrusts toimprove soil structure and function at the
    early stages of succession and promote ecosystem recovery is enor-mous. In this
    study, we evaluated the capacity of lichen biocrusts to spontaneously establish
    and develop on roadslopes in a Mediterranean shrubland. We also compared taxonomic
    and functional diversity of biocrusts betweenroad slopes and natural habitats
    in the surroundings. Biocrust richness and cover, species composition, and func-tional
    structure were measured in 17 road slopes (nine roadcuts and eight embankments)
    along a 13 km highwaystretch. Topography, soil properties and vascular plant communities
    of road slopes were also characterized. Weused Kruskal&ndash;Wallis tests and
    applied redundancy analysis (RDA) to test the effect of environmental scenario(road
    slopes vs. natural habitat) and other local factors on biocrust features. We found
    that biocrusts were com-mon in road slopes after&sim;20 years of construction
    with no human assistance needed. However, species richnessand cover were still
    lower than in natural remnants. Also, functional structure was quite similar between
    roadcuts(i.e., after soil excavation) and natural remnants, and topography and
    soil properties influenced species composi-tion while environmental scenario type
    and vascular plant cover did not. These findings further support the ideaof biocrusts
    as promising restoration tools in drylands and confirm the critical role of edaphic
    factors in biocrustestablishment and development in land-use change scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;'
