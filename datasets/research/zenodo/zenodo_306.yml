  title: Higher soil moisture increases forest temperature buffering
  abstract: "Abstract\n\n\nForests can buffer the understory against temperature extremes\
    \ often creating cooler microclimates during warm summer days compared to temperatures\
    \ outside the forest. The buffering of maximum temperatures in the understory\
    \ results from a combination of canopy shading and air cooling through soil water\
    \ evaporation and plant transpiration. Therefore, buffering capacity of forests\
    \ depends on canopy cover and soil moisture content, which are increasingly threatened\
    \ by more frequent and severe canopy disturbances and soil droughts. The extent\
    \ to which this buffering will be maintained in future conditions is unclear due\
    \ to the lack of understanding about the relationship between soil moisture and\
    \ air temperature buffering in interaction with canopy cover and topographic settings.\
    \ We explored how soil moisture variability affects temperature offsets between\
    \ outside and inside the forest on a daily basis, using temperature and soil moisture\
    \ data from 57 sites in temperate broadleaved forests in Central Europe over four\
    \ climatically different summer seasons. Daily maximum temperatures in forest\
    \ understories were on average 2\xB0C cooler than outside temperatures. The buffering\
    \ of understory temperatures was more effective when soil moisture was higher,\
    \ and the offsets were more sensitive to soil moisture on sites with drier soils\
    \ and on sun-exposed slopes with high topographic heat load. Based on these results,\
    \ it can be expected that, in a warmer climate with longer dry periods, the soil-water\
    \ limitation of forest buffering will become more prevalent and will likely lead\
    \ to changes in understory communities. Our results support the inclusion of soil\
    \ moisture in models and predictions of forest microclimate, understory biodiversity\
    \ and tree regeneration, aiming to provide a more precise estimate of the effects\
    \ of climate change."
