  title: Stabilization Of Red Soil Using Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag &amp;
    Alccofine
  abstract: "Structure foundations need to be on stable and strong soils. Soils range\
    \ in strength. Some soils are able to support a skyscraper, while other soils\
    \ are not able to support the weight of a human. If the soil under a building\
    \ is not stable, the foundation of the building could crack, sink, or worse\u2013\
    the building could fall. The strength and stability of soil depend on its physical\
    \ properties. Soil with good structure is more stable. Clay textures are often\
    \ more stable than sand textures because they have better structure. However,\
    \ a mix of particle sizes (and pore sizes) is best for engineering (just as it\
    \ is best for growing crops). It is also important that soil is stable through\
    \ wetting and drying cycles, so that expanding soil does not crack roads or foundations.\
    \ Some clay minerals, from a family called smectite, are more likely to shrink\
    \ and expand during wetting and drying cycles than minerals from other families,\
    \ such as kaolinite."
