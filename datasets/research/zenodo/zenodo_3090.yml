  title: Towards a roadmap for EU Agricultural Soil Management - Guidelines for work
    package 2 task 2.3 Identification of barriers and opportunities by scenario development
  abstract: "The European Joint Program SOIL aims to create an integrated framework\
    \ for soil research in Europe, tosupport harmonization of capacity, capability\
    \ and knowledge for all Member States (MS), in order to enableall countries to\
    \ use the knowledge on soil to face the global challenges. The program objective\
    \ is to reducethe fragmentation of research to enhance agricultural soils potential\
    \ to contribute to climate changeadaptation and mitigation, while preserving productivity\
    \ and environmental functions.The soil knowledge has to be developed, shared and\
    \ transferred, stored and organised, and applied, and task2.3 activity aims to\
    \ identify barriers to and opportunities for the enhancement of knowledge \u2013\
    \ development,sharing and transfer, organization and storage, application - on\
    \ agricultural soils.\n\nOutput of task 2.3 will contribute to the definition\
    \ of the roadmap, a key tool to support strategic decisionmaking for science,\
    \ policy and implementation issues.\_"
