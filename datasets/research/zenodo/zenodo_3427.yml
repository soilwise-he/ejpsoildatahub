  title: Water And Soil Environment Pollution Reduction By Filter Strips
  abstract: 'Contour filter strips planted with perennial vegetation

    can be used to improve surface and ground water quality by reducing

    pollutant, such as NO3-N, and sediment outflow from cropland to a

    river or lake. Meanwhile, the filter strips of perennial grass with biofuel

    potentials also have economic benefits of producing ethanol. In

    this study, The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was

    applied to the Walnut Creek Watershed to examine the effectiveness

    of contour strips in reducing NO3-N outflows from crop fields to the

    river or lake. Required input data include watershed topography,

    slope, soil type, land-use, management practices in the watershed and

    climate parameters (precipitation, maximum/minimum air

    temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity).

    Numerical experiments were conducted to identify potential

    subbasins in the watershed that have high water quality impact, and

    to examine the effects of strip size and location on NO3-N reduction

    in the subbasins under various meteorological conditions (dry,

    average and wet). Variable sizes of contour strips (10%, 20%, 30%

    and 50%, respectively, of a subbasin area) planted with perennial

    switchgrass were selected for simulating the effects of strip size and

    location on stream water quality. Simulation results showed that a

    filter strip having 10%-50% of the subbasin area could lead to 55%-

    90% NO3-N reduction in the subbasin during an average rainfall

    year. Strips occupying 10-20% of the subbasin area were found to be

    more efficient in reducing NO3-N when placed along the contour

    than that when placed along the river. The results of this study can

    assist in cost-benefit analysis and decision-making in best water

    resources management practices for environmental protection.'
