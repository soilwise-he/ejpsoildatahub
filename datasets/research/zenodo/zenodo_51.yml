  title: Soil frost-induced soil moisture precipitation feedback over high northern
    latitudes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Permafrost or perennially frozen ground is an important part
    of the terrestrial cryosphere; roughly one quarter of Earth&#39;s land surface
    is underlain by permafrost. The impact of the currently observed warming, which
    is projected to persist during the coming decades due to anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    input, certainly has effects for the vast permafrost areas of the high northern
    latitudes. The quantification of these effects, however, is scientifically still
    an open question. This is partly due to the complexity of the system, where several
    feedbacks are interacting between land and atmosphere, sometimes counterbalancing
    each other. Moreover, until recently, many global circulation models (GCMs) and
    Earth system models (ESMs) lacked the sufficient representation of cold region
    physical soil processes in their land surface schemes, especially of the effects
    of freezing and thawing of soil water for both energy and water cycles. Therefore,
    it will be analysed in the present study how these processes impact large-scale
    hydrology and climate over northern hemisphere high latitude land areas. For this
    analysis, the atmosphere-land part of MPI-ESM, ECHAM6-JSBACH, is driven by prescribed
    observed SST and sea ice in an AMIP2-type setup with and without newly implemented
    cold region soil processes. Results show a large improvement in the simulated
    discharge. On one hand this is related to an improved snowmelt peak of runoff
    due to frozen soil in spring. On the other hand a subsequent reduction of soil
    moisture leads to a positive land atmosphere feedback to precipitation over the
    high latitudes, which reduces the model&rsquo;s wet biases in precipitation and
    evapotranspiration during the summer. This is noteworthy as soil moisture &ndash;
    atmosphere feedbacks have previously not been in the research focus over the high
    latitudes. These results point out the importance of high latitude physical processes
    at the land surface for the regional climate.&lt;/p&gt;'
