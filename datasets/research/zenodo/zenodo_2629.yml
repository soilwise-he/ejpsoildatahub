  abstract: <em>This article provides information on the development and agrotechnics
    of the growth of medicinal Amaranth (Amaranthus) as the main crop. Currently,
    planting water and energy-efficient crops, growing environmentally friendly, high-quality
    crops is one of the pressing issues. Amaranth has important positive aspects,
    its high resistance to drought, high demand for agrotechnics, high coverage and
    efficiency of fertilizers, resistance and adaptability to various soil-climatic
    conditions, small planting standards, rapid growth, resistance to pests and diseases,
    sensitivity to soil treatment and number of bushes, planting norm.</em>
