  title: AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR AND TEMPERATURE SENSOR
  abstract: The productivity of the crop depends on the soil, fertilizers, and water.
    The fertilizers provide micronutrients for vegetable farming like nitrogen, zinc,
    and others. To meet the increasing demand for food, crops should be able to withstand
    the adverse effects produced by the environment and unpredictable sources. The
    structure of smart agriculture is similar to networks, which are designed in 3
    layers. Sensor layer to get information about various parameters, products, and
    operating environment. Transport layer to communicate the obtained information
    in between the various devices and as well as to and from a remote server. Application
    layer to analyse, visualize and predict the data for further actions to be implemented.
    In the proposed system, it uses multilinear regression to predict the water levels
    and micro-nutrients that are excess for the crop cultivation because farmers need
    analog data, not digital data. So that they can take necessary precautionary steps
    to protect the field from getting damaged.
