  title: 'Larvicide effects of Bacillus sp isolated from soil against fall armyworm
    Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)'
  abstract: Prolonged use of pesticides was known to have a negative impact on the
    environment, health, and living organisms. Therefore alternative pest control
    techniques need to be developed continuously. One pest eradication techniques
    that is believed to be safe for the environment is biological control. This study
    intended to evaluate the toxicity properties of 7 different isolates suspension
    of <em>Bacillus</em> sp. isolated from soil in a botanical garden in West Lampung
    against <em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em> larvae. Morphological characterization
    of protein crystals which are toxic to insects contained in the suspension was
    carried out microscopically at a magnification of 1000x. Then, each isolate suspension
    was tested for its toxicity properties on the 3rd instar larvae of <em>S. frugiverda</em>.
    The protein crystal morphology of the <em>Bacillus</em> sp isolate coded TB7 was
    similar to that of <em>L. sphaericus</em>. While the other six isolates (TMA 26,
    TBA 4, TBA 7, TB 5, BP 14, and TSR 6) had morphological characteristics similar
    to that found in the <em>B. thuringiensis</em>. The results of larvicide test
    showed that <em>Bacillus</em> sp isolates coded TMA 26, TBA 7, BP 14 and TB 5
    caused mortality on day 3. TBA 4 isolates killed larvae on day 4, while isolates
    coded TSR 6 and TB 7 killed larvae on day 5. In conclusion, <em>Bacillus</em>
    sp isolate isolated from soil has toxic properties to the larvae of <em>S frugiperda</em>.
    So it is suggested that the bacterial isolate <em>Bacillus</em> sp can be used
    as a biological control agent for insect pests.
