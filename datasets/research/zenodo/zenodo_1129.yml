  title: Assessing the role of microplastics as a disturbance to soil resilience
  abstract: 'Studies have found microplastics (MP) in soil environments and have reported
    their impacts on soil properties, soil functioning, and microbial communities.
    In soil management systems, soil resilience is critical for the long-term sustainability
    of soil resources and the prevention of soil degradation. For the past two decades,
    soil resilience has been discussed extensively in the wider scientific literature.
    Agricultural practices, industrial activities, deforestation, overexploitation
    of the vegetative cover, flooding, and tillage operations have been identified
    as having an impact on soil. Numerous methods have been discussed to measure soil
    resilience in relation to the above-mentioned disturbances; however, the impact
    of MP has not been fully addressed. There is a need for assessment methods on
    the potential effects of MP on soil resilience. We, therefore, present the results
    of a literature review aimed at investigating approaches for assessing the impact
    of MP on soil resilience. This serves as a foundation for developing a paradigm
    for examining the role of MP as a soil disturbance. In this presentation, we explore
    the potential methods of assessing the impact of MP on soil resilience. There
    is a need to measure and define the impact of MP on soil resilience to identify
    the risks that MP poses for the long-term sustainability of our soils. Also see:
