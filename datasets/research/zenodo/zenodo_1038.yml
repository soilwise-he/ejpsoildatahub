  title: Geotechnical Study for Diverse Soil Profiles at Fluctuated Bore Hole Locations
  abstract: "The geotechnical investigation is to ascertain the nature and characteristics\
    \ of sub-soil below the ground level at the Existing site. The study would include\
    \ identification of suitable foundation systems for the subject work and assessment\
    \ of safe bearing capacity.\n\n\_\n\nThis study presents an account of field and\
    \ laboratory activities. An analysis of the field and laboratory tests results\
    \ have been carried out to determine the barring capacity of soil for the optimum\
    \ design of foundation. This report incorporates recommendation for the allowable\
    \ soil pressure to be adopted for the Existing structure.\n\n\_\n\nThe soil investigation\
    \ was carried out in accordance with the Indian Standard Code of Practice IS 2131-\
    \ 1981 (Reaffirmed 1997) and other IS code of practice.\n\n\_"
