  title: Effect of Irrigation Salinity Water on Soil Properties of Sikar District,
    Rajasthan (2023)
  abstract: A survey was Sikar, Lacchmangarh and Fatehpur tehsils area to determine
    the quality of irrigation water, its effect on soil properties in the irrigated
    areas. One hundred water samples collected from irrigated area of Sikar District
    of Rajasthan. The presence of soil is necessary to prevent direct leaching of
    the inorganic pollutants in the irrigation water. Color, temperature, pH, EC,
    T.D.S, Alk, T.H, Ca-H, Mg-H, Fluoride, Nitrate, Sulfate, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium
    are the physical properties of soil. Suitability of soil for agriculture is determined
    by the physical properties. Through such studies, we endeavor to highlight the
    potential for hazardous impact that nature might face due to excessive anthropological
    activity.
