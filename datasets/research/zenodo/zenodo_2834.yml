  title: Effect Of Inclusion Of Crumb Rubber On The Unconfined Compressive Strength
    And Wet-Dry Durability Of Cement Stabilized Clayey Soil
  abstract: In the present study, the effect of inclusion of waste crumb rubber and
    cement on the unconfined compressive strength and wet-dry durability of clayey
    soil has been investigated. Crumb rubber and cement were added to clayey soil
    at ranges of 2.5%-10% and 3%-6% respectively. The results of the investigation
    revealed that the incorporation of crumb rubber influenced the unconfined compressive
    strength, axial strain at failure, energy absorption capacity and wet-dry durability
    of the cement-stabilized clay. The study reveals that as the content of crumb
    rubber in the cement-stabilized clayey soil increases the unconfined compressive
    strength decreases but prosperously changes the behavior of the cement-stabilized
    clay from brittle to ductile. The axial strain corresponding to peak axial stress
    and energy absorption capacity of the specimens can be increased by limiting the
    content of crumb rubber up to 5%. The weight loss of the cement-stabilized clay
    mixed with crumb rubber increases as the content of crumb rubber increases. With
    the prolongation of the curing period, the weight loss of cement-stabilized clay
    mixed with crumb rubber decreases. Further, the weight loss of 90 days cured specimens
    of clayey soil incorporated with 6% cement and crumb rubber up to 5% meets the
    recommendation of the material to be used in construction of road pavements as
    a base, sub-base, and shoulder. Most importantly, the utilization/disposal of
    this hazardous waste material reduces its impact on environment and health.
