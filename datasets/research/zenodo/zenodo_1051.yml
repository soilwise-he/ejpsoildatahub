  title: An Assessment of Soil Resource of Hisar District Using Geospatial Technology
  abstract: Soil and water are the main vital non-renewable natural resources that
    are the base of all practices monitoring production of agriculture. Over exploitation
    of land &amp; water resources create substantial changes in the land use which
    have hostile consequence to the natural environment. As the land resources have
    been sole resources of sustenance of mankind, the timely mapping, management and
    monitoring of land resources became a prime requisite for developmental management
    of natural resources. Latest technologies like Geo-informatics have developed
    as significant tools in present era for management and monitoring of water and
    land resources. Thus the novelty of the present research is to access the soil
    and water resources in Hisar district.
