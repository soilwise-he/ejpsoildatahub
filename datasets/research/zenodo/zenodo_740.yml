  title: Sorption and Desorption of Cobalt by Soils and Soil Components
  abstract: "Chemistry Department, D. S. College, Aligarh-202 001 <em>Manuscript received\
    \ 28 September 1989, revised 20 November 1992, accepted 7 January 1993</em> The\
    \ sorption desorption of cobalt was studied on different soils of India and different\
    \ components of soil at cobalt concentrations within the range 0.5- 8 <em>\xB5\
    </em>g ml<sup>-1</sup> with 0.01<em>M</em> CaCl<sub>2 </sub>as background electrolyte\
    \ at pH 6.5. The maximum adsorption of Co occurs at pH 6.5 and almost complete\
    \ sorption occurs within 48 h. The sorption was maximum with ferromanganese oxide\
    \ followed by organic materials. The order of desorption was clay minerals&gt;\
    \ humic acids &gt;ferro manganese oxide. The sorption isotherms for natural soils\
    \ at low site coverages were linear and sorption on different soils was studied.\
    \ The studies also showed that cobalt sorption in natural soil is largely controlled\
    \ by ferro-manganese oxide."
