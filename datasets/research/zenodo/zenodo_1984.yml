  title: THE AMOUNT OF NUTRIENTS IN THE SOIL AND THE INFLUENCE OF ORGANIC FERTILIZERS
    ON PLANTS
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today, organic fertilizers have a complex effect on
    the soil and have a positive effect on the growth, development and productivity
    of crops, including cotton. However, in order to increase their efficiency, organic
    fertilizers, including half-rotted cattle manure, should be studied individually
    in each soil-climate condition and agricultural crop. The main role in this is
    played by the state of soil fertility. The main substance determining soil fertility
    is humus. The higher the quantity and quality of humus, the higher the productivity.
    However, according to most scientists, the amount of humus in the soil has been
    significantly decreasing over the last 30-50 years. One of the main reasons for
    this process is the lack of organic fertilizers in agriculture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
