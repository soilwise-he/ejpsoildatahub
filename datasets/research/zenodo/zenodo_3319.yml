  title: Soil Resistivity Data Computations; Single And Two - Layer Soil Resistivity
    Structure And Its Implication On Earthing Design
  abstract: 'Performing High Voltage (HV) tasks with a multi craft

    work force create a special set of safety circumstances. This paper

    aims to present vital information relating to when it is acceptable to

    use a single or a two-layer soil structure. Also it discusses the

    implication of the high voltage infrastructure on the earth grid and the

    safety of this implication under a single or a two-layer soil structure.

    A multiple case study is investigated to show the importance of using

    the right soil resistivity structure during the earthing system design.'
