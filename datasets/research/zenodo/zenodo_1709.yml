  title: Multielement analysis of soil and plant species using wavelength-dispersive
    X-ray fluorescence spectrometry
  abstract: 'CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute (Council of Scientific &amp;
    Industrial Research), Hyderabad-500 606, India E-mail: keshav_krishna@ngri.res.in,
    Keshav_aradhi@yahoo.com, Fax: 91-40-23434651 In the present study, a sequential
    wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (WD-XRF) method for the
    quantitative analysis of 11 elements (AI, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, K, As, Co, Cr, Cu and
    Zn) in soil and plant species has been developed. Certified reference materials
    were used to calibrate and evaluate an analytical method for the determination
    of major and trace elements in soils, while for plant species a qualitative scanning
    method which displays peak and element identification, taking into account the
    typical element contents in different plant specimens was performed. A calibration
    procedure was estimated by employing six plant samples for obtaining a quantitative
    XRF method based on empirical calibration mode. The samples were prepared as pressed
    pellets, and analysis was performed within a total measuring time of 15 min per
    sample. The detection limits obtained for the trace elements (1-2 mg/kg) are adequate
    both for geochemical and environmental purposes and the accuracy of the method
    is within the expected interval of certified values in most cases. On the whole,
    analytical performance of the WD-XRF method proposed proved to be effective and
    robust.'
