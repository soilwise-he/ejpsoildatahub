  title: Groundcover Mulching in Mediterranean Vineyards Improves Soil Chemical, Physical
    and Biological Health Already in the Short Term
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Vineyards are among the land uses with the highest soil degradation
    rate in Mediterranean&lt;br&gt;

    Europe, mainly due to intensive tillage management. Therefore, practices able
    to foster soil health are&lt;br&gt;

    critical to promote sustainable wine production. We studied the following treatments
    in two organic&lt;br&gt;

    farms in Chianti Classico (Italy): conventional tillage, spontaneous vegetation,
    pigeon bean (Vicia&lt;br&gt;

    faba var. minor) incorporated in spring and a mixture of barley (Hordeum vulgare)
    and squarrosum&lt;br&gt;

    clover (Trifolium squarrosum), both incorporated and left as mulch. An innovative
    approach, based on&lt;br&gt;

    gamma-ray and apparent electrical conductivity, was used to account for the fine-scale
    soil variability&lt;br&gt;

    that was included in the statistical model. Mulched groundcovers were associated
    with higher soil&lt;br&gt;

    organic matter compared to tillage, already after two years. An increased N availability
    was found&lt;br&gt;

    under all groundcovers compared with tillage. The effect of soil management practices
    on P2O5&lt;br&gt;

    strongly varied across farms and years, while it was not statistically significant
    on K availability.&lt;br&gt;

    Spontaneous vegetation positively influenced the soil structure index, soil penetration
    resistance and&lt;br&gt;

    soil biological health. The results show that mulched groundcovers can improve
    soil health already&lt;br&gt;

    in the short term, thereby potentially increasing the sustainability of the wine
    sector.&lt;/p&gt;'
