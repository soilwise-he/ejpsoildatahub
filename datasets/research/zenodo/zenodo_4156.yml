  title: Impacts Of Climate Change On Water Resources Of Greater Zab And Lesser Zab
    Basins, Iraq, Using Soil And Water Assessment Tool Model
  abstract: The Greater Zab and Lesser Zab are the major tributaries of Tigris River
    contributing the largest flow volumes into the river. The impacts of climate change
    on water resources in these basins have not been well addressed. To gain a better
    understanding of the effects of climate change on water resources of the study
    area in near future (2049-2069) as well as in distant future (2080-2099), Soil
    and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied. The model was first calibrated for
    the period from 1979 to 2004 to test its suitability in describing the hydrological
    processes in the basins. The SWAT model showed a good performance in simulating
    streamflow. The calibrated model was then used to evaluate the impacts of climate
    change on water resources. Six general circulation models (GCMs) from phase five
    of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) under three Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 for periods of 2049-2069
    and 2080-2099 were used to project the climate change impacts on these basins.
    The results demonstrated a significant decline in water resources availability
    in the future.
