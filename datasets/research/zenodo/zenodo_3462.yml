  title: Behaviour Of Masonry Wall Constructed Using Interlocking Soil Cement Bricks
  abstract: 'According to the masonry standard the compressive

    strength is basically dependent on factors such as the mortar strength

    and the relative values of unit and mortar strength. However

    interlocking brick has none or less use of mortar. Therefore there is a need to
    investigate the behavior of masonry walls using interlocking

    bricks. In this study a series of tests have been conducted; physical

    properties and compressive strength of brick units and masonry walls

    were constructed from interlocking bricks and tested under constant

    vertical load at different eccentricities. The purpose of the

    experimental investigations is to obtain the force displacement curves, analyze
    the behavior of masonry walls. The results showed

    that the brick is categorized as common brick (BS 3921:1985) and severe weathering
    grade (ASTM C62). The maximum compressive stress of interlocking brick wall is
    3.6 N/mm2 and fulfilled the requirement of standard for residential building.'
