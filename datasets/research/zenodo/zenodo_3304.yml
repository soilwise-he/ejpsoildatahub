  title: Soil Improvement Using Cement Dust Mixture
  abstract: 'Day by day technology increases and problems

    associated with this technology also increase. Several researches

    were carried out to investigate the deployment of such material safely

    in geotechnical engineering in particular and civil engineering in

    general. However, different types of waste material have such as

    cement duct, fly ash and slag been proven to be suitable in several

    applications. In this research cement dust mixed with different

    percentages of sand will be used in some civil engineering

    application as will be explained later in this paper throughout filed

    and laboratory test. The used mixer (waste material with sand) prove

    high performance, durability to environmental condition, low cost

    and high benefits. At higher cement dust ratio, small cement ratio is

    valuable for compressive strength and permeability. Also at small

    cement dust ratio higher cement ratio is valuable for compressive

    strength.'
