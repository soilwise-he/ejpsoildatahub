  title: Effect of panchagavya, Jivamruta and fertility levels on soil health of greengram
    in Varanasi region
  abstract: "A biannual trial on greengram was carried out in agriculture research\
    \ farm of Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi during cropping year 2020-21 and\
    \ 2021-22 to assess the consequences of Panchagavya, Jivamruta and fertility levels\
    \ on health of soil. HUM 16 variety of moong bean was cultivated in sandy clay\
    \ loam soil. Greengram improves soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation\
    \ and addition of root material. The research was carried out in split plot design\
    \ with 3 main plot treatments (3 levels of RDF) and 4 subplot treatments (fertilizer\
    \ control, Panchagavya, Panchagavya+ Jivamruta and Jivamruta). At the end of trial,\
    \ Lowest pH (7.69), highest EC (0.285 dSm-1), highest SOC (0.503%), highest available\
    \ N (195.53 kg ha-1), P (22.67 kg ha-1), K (207.74 kg ha-1), DHA (27.96 \xB5g\
    \ TPF g-1 soil day-1), APA (64.97 \xB5g P-NP soil h-1) was found with Panchagavya\
    \ treatment (in subplot). And Jivamruta recorded highest SMBC (348.8 \xB5g g-1\
    \ soil). Liquid organic manures like PG and JM can reduce the use of agro-chemicals\
    \ in greengram and maintain soil health."
