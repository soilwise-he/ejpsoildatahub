  title: Modeling of Azadirachta indica leaves powder efficiency for the remediation
    of soil contaminated with crude oil
  abstract: "A regression analysis model was developed to examine the reliability\
    \ and the acceptability of the sun-dried and room-dried <em>Azadirachta indica</em>\
    \ leaves for the remediation crude oil contaminated soil in Niger Deltal, Nigeria.\
    \ An experimental approach was used to monitor the concentration of the total\
    \ petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation that was enhanced in the presence of\
    \ the microbes in the reactor. A regression analysis was performed to evaluate\
    \ the reaction behavior microbes in reactor for the remediation of the TPH in\
    \ the presence of sun-dried and room-dried <em>A. indica</em> leaves in sandy\
    \ and loamy soils contaminated with 100 ml of crude oil. The physicochemical properties\
    \ of control loamy soil was as; pH (6.75), electric conductivity (10.36 \xB5S/cm),\
    \ total oxygen (2.99%), total Nitrogen (0.091%), potassium (36.82942%), phosphorus\
    \ (15.36%) and total bacteria (2.15\xD710<sup>2 </sup>cfu/g). Whereas, these values\
    \ were as pH (6.82), electric conductivity (21.48 \xB5S/cm), total oxygen content\
    \ (1.18%), total nitrogen (0.036%), potassium (24.03681%), phosphorus (5.18%)\
    \ and total bacteria count (1.86\xD710<sup>2 </sup>cfu/g) for sandy soil. The\
    \ inoculant was prepared by blending sun-dried and room-dried <em>A. indica</em>\
    \ leaves. The blended <em>A. indica</em> leaves in 50 to 100 g range were applied\
    \ on the polluted soils for 35 days and significant reduction in contaminating\
    \ agents was observed. The highest remediation was observed in soils treated with\
    \ 100 g room dried <em>A. indica</em> leaves. A 96% remediation recorded in sandy\
    \ soil treated with 100 g room dried <em>A. indica leaves</em> as TPH depleted\
    \ from 35818.69 mg/kg to 1349.109 mg/kg and 92% reduction was observed in loamy\
    \ soil treated with 100 g dried <em>A. indica</em> leaves and TPH depleted from\
    \ 48508.92 mg/kg to 3977.739 mg/kg. The regression model developed was successfully\
    \ employed to predict TPH remediation behavior, which can be applied to monitor\
    \ remediation of contaminated soil."
