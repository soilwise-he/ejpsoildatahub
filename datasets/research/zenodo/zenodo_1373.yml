  title: Soil-Protective Water-Saving Technologies For Watering Agricultural Crops
    On Eroded Soils
  abstract: "The article deals with the results of the analysis of long-term studies\
    \ on the study of soil-protective, water efficiency technologies for the cultivation\
    \ of crops on eroded soils. For the conditions of irrigated and erosion impacted\
    \ typical loamy soils of a Chirchik\u2013Angren valley, the law of a liability\
    \ of the typical loamy soils impacted by erosion is revealed depending on the\
    \ form of furrows and the size of a jet. The optimum forms of the furrow and size\
    \ of a jet are determined for the condition of typical loamy soils at growing\
    \ potatoes. The influence of the form of a furrow on the contents of organic matter,\
    \ total nitrogen, common phosphorus in a liquid and firm drain has established\
    \ the losses of nutritious substances with a liquid and firm drain are revealed\
    \ depending on elements of irrigation technology. The growth and development of\
    \ the potatoes are studied. The economic efficiency is determined at the cultivation\
    \ of potatoes on typical erosion damaged loamy soils."
