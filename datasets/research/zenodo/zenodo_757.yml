  title: Environmental sanitation factors as prevalence support of soil transmitted
    helminths
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of soil transmitted helminths (STH) is closely
    related to the defecation facilities for rural communities, such as: the habit
    of defecating openly on the ground, in gardens and using open latrines in rivers.
    The aim of this study was to determine the effect of environmental sanitation
    risk factors on the prevalence of STH infection. This study was included in an
    analytical epidemiological study at two locations, using a cross sectional study
    as the research design. The location were Sri Kembang Village, Bukit Village,
    which is included in Betung District, Banyuasin Regency, and South Sumatra, Indonesia
    for 30 days. There were 252 students as the research sample. Data analysis showed
    that the prevalence of T. trichiura was higher in Sri Kembang State Primary School
    Number 1 with mild to very severe infection degrees. The intensity of A. lumbricoides
    infection in Bukit State Primary School Number 1 got a higher prevalence than
    Sri Kembang. Open defecation, gardens or open latrines, and types of houses with
    dirt floors indicate environmental sanitation factors that are sufficient to support
    the prevalence of STH. For further research, it is recommended to examine socio-economic
    risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;'
