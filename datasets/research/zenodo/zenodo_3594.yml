  title: An AI solution for Soil Fertility and Crop Friendliness Detection and Monitoring
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the main occupation of India and more than 50%
    of people are dependent on agriculture. Research on agriculture will strengthen
    the economic growth of the country. Technologies play a vital role to bolster
    the agriculture. Since soil is the main fount of agriculture , there is a need
    for significant approach to help the farmer to test and monitor the soil and its
    properties ,which will boost the fertility of the soil thereby intensifying the
    crop growth, also if crop recommendations are imparted to farmers in a proper
    way, crop yield can be enhanced to meet the growing demand for the food. Proper
    awareness on soil will benefit the farmers to grow the right and healthy crop.
    To overcome the disadvantages of traditional soil testing practices we are proposing
    an approach which has Deep learning, an artificial intelligence(AI) technique
    and IOT features . This helps in getting fast and accurate result. Soil fertility
    can be calculated by parameters like pH level, temperature, Moisture content of
    the soil,temperature, humidity and NPK(nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) ,organic
    matter, carbon level. Weather and Climatic conditions along with the soil parameters
    will help to evaluate the soil fertility. The lacking nutrients in the soil and
    needed nutrients/fertilizers to boost the soil fertility can be suggested to the
    farmers and also the crops which can be suitably grown from the given soil sample
    and nutrients required for all the recommended crops to enhance the yield can
    be suggested to the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;'
