  title: DIFFERENCES IN FIELD SOIL MOISTURE AT SOYBEAN SOWING DUE TO DIFFERENT ANNUAL
    METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
  abstract: The content of soil moisture in different soil horizons of soybean fields
    in the 0-150 cm layer was studied in years with different meteorological conditions,
    including separately for the bare and cenosis soils. The value of moisture reserves
    in the soil during the spring sowing period are determined by the total amount
    of precipitation and their relative index (RPI) in the previous period of soil
    water accumulation (September-April). During the growing season, water losses
    from bare soil occur mainly from the arable layer; the decrease in the total moisture
    reserves of the deep layers of the soil of the soybean cenosis is mainly associated
    with plants.
