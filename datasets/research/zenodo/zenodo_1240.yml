  title: Corn Waste with Addition of Biochar as New Alternative of Soil Media
  abstract: <em>Corn waste is now an alarming environmental issue. Every year, an
    estimated 300,000 metric tons of corn waste was produced in Malaysia. Most of
    the waste is either landfilled or burned which releases methane, a potent greenhouse
    gas. Corncobs and husk as organic planting medium are a potential solution to
    this issue. It is abundant, easily obtained and offers multiple benefits as planting
    media. They are light, porous, absorbent and aid in soil structure as well as
    holding nutrients that are good for plants. It helps to minimize the amount of
    waste and improve soil quality and crop yields. Furthermore, using corn waste
    might be a cost-effective strategy to boost crop yields and have great economic
    potential as planting media. The organic planting industry is growing and there
    is rising demand for sustainable and cost-effective alternatives for plant media.
    To satisfy the need, corn waste is a potential choice. Our product is made of
    corn, and it went through a few processes to become a soil media such as grinding
    and drying process. With the addition of biochar, we also provided steps of making
    it such as baking process until it forms into carbon rich charcoal. To compare
    our product with coco peat, we raise an argument on the amount of carbon dioxide
    that was produced and preserving environment quality.</em>
