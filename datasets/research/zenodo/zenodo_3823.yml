  title: Scope Of Bod, Nitrogen And Phosphorous Removal Through Plant-Soil Interaction
    In The Wetland
  abstract: Constructed and natural wetlands are being used extensively to treat different
    types of wastewater including the domestic one. Considerable removal efficiency
    has been achieved for a variety of pollutants like BOD, nitrogen and phosphorous
    in the wetlands. Wetland treatment appears to be the best choice for treatment
    or pre-treatment of wastewater because of the low maintenance cost and simplicity
    of operation. Wetlands are the natural exporters of organic carbon on account
    of decomposition of organic matter. The emergent plants like reeds, bulrushes
    and cattails are commonly used in constructed wetland for the treatment process
    providing surface for bacterial growth, filtration of solids, nutrient uptake
    and oxygenation to promote nitrification as well as denitrification. The present
    paper explored different scopes of organic matter (BOD), nitrogen and phosphorous
    removal from wastewater through wetlands. Emphasis is given to look into the soil
    chemistry for tracing the behavior of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the wetland.
    Due consideration is also made to see the viability for upgrading the BOD, nitrogen
    and phosphorus removal efficiency through different classical modifications of
    wetland.
