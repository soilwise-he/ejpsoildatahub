  title: 'Terraced Landscapes as NBSs for Geo-Hydrological Hazard Mitigation: Towards
    a Methodology for Debris and Soil Volume Estimations through a LiDAR Survey'
  abstract: "Terraced landscapes are widely applied in many mountainous regions around\
    \ the world<br> as a result of the necessity to practice subsistence agriculture.\
    \ Hence, they can be regarded as one of<br> the most diffused anthropogenic modifications\
    \ of the Earth\u2019s surface. Different techniques have<br> been used for their\
    \ implementation leading to the artificial immobilization of debris and soil along<br>\
    \ the slopes whose surface is interrupted by a sequence of sub-horizontal and\
    \ sub-vertical areas often<br> using stone walls. In some areas of the world,\
    \ such interventions are thousands of years old and<br> their resistance to the\
    \ degradation caused by the morphogenetic system can be attributed to the<br>\
    \ permeability of the stone walls as well as to their regular maintenance. In\
    \ some other areas, the lack<br> of maintenance has been the main cause for degradation\
    \ processes ending with their collapse. The<br> effects of climate change manifested\
    \ through higher intensities and higher frequencies of rainfall<br> are likely\
    \ to accelerate the degradation process further by causing terraces to act as\
    \ a source of debris<br> or hyperconcentrated flow. This will in turn increase\
    \ the severity of geo-hydrological hazards. The<br> measures concerning reduction\
    \ of geo-hydrological hazards caused by are sought through<br> identification\
    \ of abandoned terraces and assessment of the potential for their sudden collapse.\
    \ The<br> present paper describes a framework for identification of abandoned\
    \ terraces and estimation of the<br> potential volume of shallow landslides that\
    \ can be generated. The research conducted aims to<br> advance the existing hazard\
    \ assessment practices by combining numerical modeling with<br> processing of\
    \ high-resolution LiDAR data. A new algorithm is developed to support localization\
    \ of<br> terraces. The catchment scale approach applied to eight smaller catchments\
    \ enables estimation of<br> the total volume of soil and debris trapped along\
    \ the slopes. It also generated some important<br> quantitative data which will\
    \ be used in the future risk assessment work. The work has been carried<br> out\
    \ within the EU-funded H2020 project RECONECT."
