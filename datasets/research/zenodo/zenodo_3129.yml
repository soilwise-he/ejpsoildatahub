  title: The Influence Of The Thermophysical Soil Properties  On The Emergence Of
    A Geothermal Field  In The Collecting System For The Low-Potential Ground Energy
  abstract: The use of renewable energy sources contributes to reducing the use of
    fossil fuels and improving the environmental situation which is an urgent task
    of today. Vertical ground heat exchangers extract the low-potential thermal energy
    of the ground mass lying below 10-15 m from the ground level and transfer it to
    the geothermal heat pumps. The low-potential energy collection systems with vertical
    ground heat exchangers do not require large areas, and do not depend on the intensity
    of solar radiation incident on the surface. They work effectively in virtually
    all types of geological environments, with the exception of the soils having low
    thermal conductivity, such as dry sand or gravel. In this paper, we propose an
    authorial method of calculating the distance between boreholes with ground heat
    exchangers taking into account the heat transfer process between the ground mass
    and the hydraulic fluid in the heat exchanger tubes eliminating the freezing of
    the boreholes. Applying the method makes it possible to choose the choose the
    best option to shape a borehole field with soil heat exchangers for a specific
    construction area taking into consideration the thermal properties of the soil
    and to create an efficient and stable source of low-potential energy for geothermal
    heat pumps. A nomogram is presented which makes it possible to determine the distance
    between the boreholes ensuring a reliable and efficient operation of the geothermal
    heat pumps during the entire period of their operation without degrading the thermal
    physical properties of the soil.
