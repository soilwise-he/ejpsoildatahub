  title: Prediction of Geotechnical Properties of Soil using Artificial Intelligence
    Framework
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The present research work is carried out to predict the geotechnical
    properties (consistency limits, OMC, and MDD) of soil using AI technologies, namely
    regression analysis (RA), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression
    (GPR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and relevance vector machine (RVM).
    The models of machine learning (SVM, GPR), hybrid learning (RVM), and deep learning
    (ANNs) are constructed in MATLAB R2020a with different configurations. The models
    of RA are built using the Data Analysis Tool of Microsoft Excel 2019. The input
    parameters of AI models are gravel, sand, silt, and clay content. The correlation
    coefficient is calculated for pair of soil datasets. The correlation shows that
    sand, silt, and clay content play a vital role in predicting soil&#39;s liquid
    limit and plasticity index. The performance of constructed AI models is compared
    to determine the optimum performance models. The limited datasets of soil are
    used in this study. Therefore, artificial neural networks and relevance vector
    machines could not perform well. Based on the performance of AI models, the Gaussian
    process regression outperformed the RA, SVM, ANNs, and RVM AI technologies. Hence,
    the GPR AI approach can predict the geotechnical properties of soil by gravel,
    sand, silt, and clay content. The Monte-Carlo global sensitivity analysis is also
    performed, and it is observed that the prediction of geotechnical properties of
    soil is affected by sand and clay content&lt;/p&gt;'
