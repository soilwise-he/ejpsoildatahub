  title: Sunflower Seed Husk as Promising By-Product for Soil Biodisinfestation Treatments
    and Fertility Improvement in Protected Lettuce Crop
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges in biodisinfestation treatments against
    soilborne pathogens is the selection of the proper organic amendments and mixture
    features. The use of agro-industrial by-products is a sustainable alternative
    with proven efficacy, but the availability has to be considered in terms of location
    and quantity. Sunflower seed is one of the five major oil crops widely cultivated
    and the husk constitutes a significant part that is discarded. This by-product
    brings together the features to be considered an interesting organic amendment
    in agricultural soils because of its lignocellulose content, but no references
    have been found in this field. In this study, sunflower seed husk was used with
    fresh cow manure in biodisinfestation treatments, alone or combined with other
    by-products (rapeseed cake, beer bagasse and wheat bran). The assay was performed
    in summer in a commercial greenhouse with significant yield losses in lettuce
    crops caused by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Four different amendment
    mixtures were applied which included 3kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;cow manure,
    as common waste, and 1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;of by-products (dry weight),
    considering 6mgC/g soil in all treatments but different C/N ratio (23, 29, 31,
    34) and by-products. Data was collected in three moments: (i) before and (ii)
    after biodisinfestation treatments and (iii) after harvesting the first crop after
    biodisinfestations. Crop damage was assessed through root galling index and the
    number of eggs in roots. The effects on the pathogen population and the whole
    soil nematode community were assessed along with some physicochemical and soil
    microbiological variables (respiration rate, microbial organic C, water-soluble
    organic C and physiological profile of heterotrophic bacteria through Biolog Ecoplates&trade;).
    All treatments reported effectiveness in disease control without significant differences
    among them, but among times. However, soil temperatures during biodisinfestations
    were higher at higher C/N ratios and fertility variables also increased in these
    cases, mainly in the treatment with husk as the only by-product. Sunflower seed
    husk proved to be an interesting source of organic C to improve both biodisinfestation
    treatments and soil fertility in humid temperate climate zones. Copyright &copy;
