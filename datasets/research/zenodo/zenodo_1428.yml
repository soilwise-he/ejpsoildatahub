  title: Impact of soil amendment using indigenous inoculants on tomato growth and
    yield parameters
  abstract: "Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum mill) is one of the most important vegetable\
    \ crops in the world. It is widely acknowledged that using composts and microbial\
    \ inoculants as soil amendments, rather than industrialized fertilizer and raw\
    \ manure, could improve soil nutrients, promote soil health and consequently improve\
    \ crop yields. Global population increase necessitates increasing crop yields.\
    \ Improvement and maintenance of soil fertility is essential via bio-augmentation\
    \ in this economic recovery era. In this work, an open field experiment was conducted\
    \ in other to study the \"Yield Effects of Indigenous Microbial Inoculants on\
    \ Tomato using autochthonous microbial consortia\u201D. The experiment was laid\
    \ in Randomized complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replicate consisted of\
    \ six inoculants samples; Indigenous cultures viz; (A) Control, (B)Bacillus mucilaginosus\_\
    (C)\_Azospirillum sp., (D)\_Azotobacter sp.\_ (E) Commercial strains of the inoculants\
    \ (F) Consortium of B, C and D. The various morphological features/yields parameters\
    \ measured at intervals includes; no. of leaves, plant height, root length, accumulated\
    \ dry matter and average fruit weight. The result shows that indigenous inoculants\
    \ (F) increased tomato overall yield. This research is also of great significance\
    \ for the development of management strategies for soil maintenance, environmental\
    \ protection, and resource conservation in Nigeria where soil fertility is on\
    \ the decrease due to over-use of land in other to achieve food security. From\
    \ the result of the research, it can be concluded that soil augmentation with\
    \ indigenous inoculants improves tomato morphological features and yields, hence\
    \ should be preferred above their exotic commercial strain counterparts because\
    \ of cost of importation/indigenous product development and GDP growth."
