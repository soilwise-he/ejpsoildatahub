  title: Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI);
    21-year drought monitoring in Iran using satellite imagery within Google Earth
    Engine
  abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring, especially
    in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent in-situ multi-temporal datasets.
    In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil
    MoisturePrecipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our
    knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in
    its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional
    RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VHI, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation
    and soil temperature in-situ data have been used. Different time scales of meteorological
    Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been used for the validation
    of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and
    soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The correlation
    coefficients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07 to 0.28, identifying
    the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses. Since the proposed
    TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal
    drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21
    years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
    (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Global Precipitation
    Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were used on the Google Earth
    Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the results, Iran experienced
    the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two
    years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as
    the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the 31 provinces
    of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels of decrease over the
    21 years were found for different provinces, while Isfahan and Gilan were the
    only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with a 0.004% and 0.002% trendline
    slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred
    in several years. In summary, this study provides updated information about
