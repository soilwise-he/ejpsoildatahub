  title: Laboratory Study On Geotextile Reinforced Soil For Poor Subgrade
  abstract: Many pavements have become useless within their design life due to sudden
    fall in subgrade strength as a result of unforeseen rise in the moisture content
    of the subgrade which may be due to a rise in ground water level (GWL) or water
    seeping through cracks on road pavement. Geosynthetic materials have been found
    worthy to be a good means of reinforcing subgrade by increasing the useful life
    of a pavement or substantially decreasing the thickness of the base course. Three
    different soil samples were obtained and were compacted according to West African
    Standard and CBR tests were carried out without reinforcement (geotextile) and
    also by placing geotextiles at various depths within the soil mass in single layers.
    Then the effect of the geosynthetic material (geotextile) was observed. The results
    show that the strength of the subgrade (laterite) is considerably lowered with
    increased moisture content; and the introduction of geotextile as reinforcement
    in the soil substantially increase the soil at all levels (2/5, 3/5, 4/5) with
    the maximum increase in strength observed to occur at 3/5 level from the base
    of the compacted soil.
