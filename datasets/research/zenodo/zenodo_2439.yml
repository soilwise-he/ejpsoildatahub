  title: Morpho-physiological Study of Wheat Genotypes With Contrasting Growth Periods,
    Cultivated Under Various Climatic and Soil Conditions
  abstract: The effect of drought on the surface area of various assimilating organs
    of durum and bread wheat genotypes with contrasting growth periods, cultivated
    under various climatic and soil conditions has been studied. To establish the
    accuracy of the obtained data, statistical analysis of some productivity indices
    was performed.
