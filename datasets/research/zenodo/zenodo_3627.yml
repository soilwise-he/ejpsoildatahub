  title: Ssi Analysis   Of Tall Chimneys With Annular Raft Considering Variable Soil
    Profile
  abstract: SSI analysis of a 200m reinforced concrete chimney with annular raft foundation
    under along-wind load is carried out in the present study. To study the effect
    of geometrical properties of chimney, different ratios of  height to base diameter(slenderness
    ratio) are selected. The ratio of outer diameter to thickness of raft were also
    varied. To understand the effect of flexibility of soil, variable soil profile
    is considered below the foundation. Three different soil layers were considered
    below the foundation.Along-wind loads are calculated as per IS:4998-1992. Three
    dimensional analysis of chimney was carried out using ANSYS software. Lateral
    tip deflection in chimney and the settlement in raft were obtained in the analysis.
    The results show that the responses in chimney are affected by the flexibility
    of soil, slenderness ratio of chimney and thickness of raft.
