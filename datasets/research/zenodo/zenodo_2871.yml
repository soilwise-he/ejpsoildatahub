  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;An advantageous plasma-catalytic setup was developed and applied towards
    the degradation of trifluralin in soil. For the first time, TiO2&nbsp;and ZnO
    catalysts were compared when employed in conjunction with micro-discharges generated
    directly into the interconnected soil channels. In the presence of catalysts,
    a significant increase in degradation efficiency was observed; after 5 min, trifluralin
    degradation increased from 66.5% (plasma alone) to 94.2% and 93% with the addition
    of TiO2&nbsp;and ZnO, respectively. In terms of degradation kinetics, TiO2&nbsp;was
    a slightly superior catalyst compared to ZnO whereas both catalysts performed
    better under oxygen than in air atmosphere. Compared to plasma alone, the plasma-catalytic
    treatment considerably increased (~3fold) the process energy efficiency. Moreover,
    the inhibitory effect of soil moisture was less pronounced during TiO2&nbsp;plasma-catalysis
    where a reduction of ~19% in pollutant degradation was observed at 5 wt% soil
    moisture compared to a ~54% reduction during plasma alone. The addition of TiO2&nbsp;and
    ZnO resulted in a significant increase in NO2&nbsp;concentration and a noticeable
    reduction in O3&nbsp;generation associated with an increase of certain plasma
    species concentration and the generation of additional and more active ROS, respectively.
    Liquid chro- matography (UPLC/MS) data at the early stages of the trifluralin
    degradation revealed similar intermediates and degradation processes between plasma-alone
    and plasma-catalysis. The present effort supports the potential of future implementation
    of a plasma-catalytic soil remediation method being a rapid, highly efficient,
    low energy demanding and green method.&lt;/p&gt;'
