  title: INFLUENCE OF MINERAL AND ORGANIC FERTILIZERS AND PHOSPHOGYPSUM ON THE AMMONIA
    AND NITRATE NITROGEN IN THE SOIL
  abstract: "The article describes the effect of mineral and organic fertilizers and\
    \ phosphogypsum on changes in soil fertility and ammonium and nitrate nitrogen\
    \ levels due to application of irrigated barren-meadow soils of Surkhandarya region.\
    \ According to the results of the study, taking into account the state of soil\
    \ reclamation, the use of 30 t ha-1 of cattle manure and 2 and 4 t ha-1 of FG\
    \ on the background of mineral fertilizers changed the soil fertility and agrochemical\
    \ properties in a positive direction, and it was observed that the amount of nitrogen\
    \ in the form of ammonium and nitrate in the soil increased compared to the control\
    \ option. In N250P175K125 background, 30 t ha-1 of manure and 2 and 4 t ha-1 \_\
    of FG were used (9;10), the amount of nitrogen in ammonium form was 34,3 and 35,2\
    \ mg/kg in the 0-30 cm layer of the soil, respectively, compared to the control\
    \ option. compared to 19,3 and 20,2 mg/kg, and the amount of nitrate nitrogen\
    \ was 37,7 and 38,8 mg/kg, which was 22,3 and 23,4 mg/kg more than the control\
    \ version."
