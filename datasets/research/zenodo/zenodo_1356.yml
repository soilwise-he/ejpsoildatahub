  title: Geo Reinforced Stone Column Technique For Soft Clay Soil Improvement-A Review
  abstract: "A very fast development of Infrastructures sector i.e. construction of\
    \ mega structures like Express highways and railways and tunnels, bridges and\
    \ tall buildings in all parts of the world, the availability of suitable ground\
    \ for the construction of civil engineering mega structures becomes a challenge\
    \ for today\u2019s geotechnical engineers. There is various ground improvement\
    \ techniques are present to strengthen the weak and soft soils based on the type\
    \ of application. One of the most extremely used ground improvement method is\
    \ a Stone column technique for soft clay soils. Where the bearing capacity of\
    \ soft soils can be improved and also the stability of structure and reduces the\
    \ settlement issues up to some permissible limits. This method was adopted in\
    \ European countries since 1950s. But now days, the utilization of geo synthetic\
    \ materials are very popular because of their various multi functions based on\
    \ the applications like reinforcement, separation, filtration and confinement,\
    \ containment etc. This article presents a review of previous experimental studies\
    \ on the performance of unreinforced soft soils improvement the bearing capacity\
    \ with reinforced sand bed over stone column. The paper explores the new ideas\
    \ where more research can be done by using geo reinforced stone column technique\
    \ to improve the bearing capacity and stiffness of soft clay soils."
