  title: Performance of Building with Basements Under Seismic Excitation Considering
    Soil Structure Interaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In modern construction, there is a trend to go deeper below
    the grade level in terms of basements which can be utilized for parking, shopping
    malls or a combination of both. In such cases, dynamic soil properties have a
    significant effect of activating dynamic soil structure interaction phenomenon
    during earthquake. Here in present study an effort is made to study the behavior
    of a building by varying five and three number of basements considering dynamic
    soil structure interaction. Issues like influence zone to be considered for dynamic
    soil structure interaction, behavior of building with basements under different
    water level conditions for two different types of layered soil and their comparison
    with fixed based structure for a real-life structure is dealt with. It is observed
    that dynamic soil structure interaction can significantly change the behavior
    and also the failure pattern of the building and hence it is recommended to perform
    dynamic soil structure interaction for building with multiple basements.&lt;/p&gt;'
