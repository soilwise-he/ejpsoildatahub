  title: Removal of Fluoride Using Brick Chip by Adsorption Prepared from Laterite
    Soil Area of Bihar and Jharkhand
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The ability of lateritic soils to remove fluoride from water
    has been studied. Important issues considered in the study include the relation
    between the mineral composition of soils and their ability to remove fluoride,
    The effect of thermal treatment of the soil on fluoride removal the predominant
    fluoride containing species remain in the treated water and the possible mechanism
    of fluoride removal by lateritic soils. Fluoride contamination in drinking water
    due to natural and anthropogenic activities has been recognized as one of the
    major problems worldwide imposing a serious threat to human health. Presence of
    fluoride in low concentration 1.5 mg l is beneficial to the people for the calcification
    of dental enamel and maintenance of healthy bones. On the other side, its presence
    in higher concentration become a monster and can cause dental, skeletal fluorosis
    and also non skeletal problems. Among several treatment technologies applied for
    fluoride removal, adsorption process has been explored widely and offers satisfactory
    results especially with mineral based and or surface modified adsorbents. It is
    evident from the literature survey that various adsorbents have shown good potential
    for the removal of fluoride. However, still there is a need to find out the practical
    utility of such developed adsorbents on a commercial scale, leading to the improvement
    of pollution control. Many investigators conducted experiments and developed various
    low cost technologies to remove fluoride from water and wastewater. However, selection
    of appropriate treatment method depends on local situation. In this experiment
    fluorine removal from water by adsorption is studied. Optimum conditions of the
    experiment have been expressed. Environmental aspects of the adsorbent have been
    analysed Sunita Singh | Dr. Sushil Kumar Singh &quot;Removal of Fluoride Using
