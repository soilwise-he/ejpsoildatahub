  title: The state of agrocenosises and hayfield meadows in farm units of Prialeisk
    soil and climate zone (Altai Krai)
  abstract: This paper presents the results of the estimation of agrocenoses and hayfield
    meadows of Prialeisk soil and climate zone in Altai krai. For the period 2001-2021
    there is a pronounced trend for increasing yields in almost all crops. The exception
    includes only permanent grasses for green feed which is explained by aridization
    of the climate and the established agrotechnology in recent decades. Data analysis
    shows that planting acreages have decreased for such crops as spring wheat (from
    107.3 thousand ha in 2001 to 59.7 thousand ha in 2021), oat (from 8.6 thousand
    ha in 2001 to 6.2 thousand ha in 2021) and permanent grasses (from 15.4 thousand
    ha in 2001 to 4.8 thousand ha in 2021). When estimating the monitoring areas with
    agrocenoses on the water index calculated using Sentinel-2 data it was identified
    that for sainfoin, linen, sunflower, lucerne and corn the range of NDWI values
    ranged from -0.2 to 0.4. Whereas they were drought tolerant crops, stress was
    insignificant. Hayland haylages as forage lands did not have any negative index
    values. For oat and soy, the index indicators were lower, the values ranged from
    -0.2 to 0.25. A value range for wheat varied from -0.2 to 0.3. Buckwheat was rich
    in phytomass and the NDWI value range was from -0.1 to 0.45. That gave evidence
    of the sufficient water availability of the crop. Agrocenoses productivity depended
    on the level of the area moistening and the soil and climate conditions were fairly
    homogeneous on the selected territories as correlation between ARVI and NDWI values
    was 0.9. According to the satellite data the most productive ones were oat crops
    with sainfoin and buckwheat.
