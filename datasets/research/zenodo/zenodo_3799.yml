  title: Relationship Between Cadmium Accumulation And Soil Ec (A Case Study Of Five
    Automobile Workshops).
  abstract: This study was conducted with soils samples from five mechanic workshops
    within Bauchi metropolis with a view to examine the relationship between Cd and
    the electrical conductivity in these soils. Resulting coefficient of correlation
    established a linear relationship between the both variables, with R2 of between
    0.869 ? 0.955 in all the study sites. Three different models (Linear, Logarithmic
    and quadratic models) were developed were found to suit the data obtained from
    the correlation between Cd and soil EC. Regression models obtained can be used
    to predict the impact of Cd in the various workshops.
