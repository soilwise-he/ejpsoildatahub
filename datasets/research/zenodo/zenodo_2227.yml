  title: Improvement of the Index and Compaction Characteristics of Black Cotton Soil
    with Palm Kernel Shell Ash
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The expansive soil obtained from Baure in Yamaltu
    Deba Local Government Area was rich in clay mineral (montmorillonite), unstable
    and difficult to use for construction purposes. The soil treated with up to 12%
    palm kernel shell ash (PKSA an agro &ndash; waste) by weight of dry soil to improve
    index properties and compaction characteristics of the soil using PKSA.&nbsp;
    Index tests were carried out to classify the natural soil, while the moisture-density
    relationships were determined by compaction tests on the natural and treated soils
    using three energy levels viz, British Standard light (BSL), West African Standard
    (WAS) and British Standard heavy (BSH). BCS used in the study was classified as
    A-7-5 (20) using the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
    Officials (AASHTO) and CH group in the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS).
    Tests results show that specific gravity of the soil increased from 2.29 for the
    natural to 2.34 at 12% treatment. Liquid limit decreased from 76.2% for natural
    to 73.4% at 10% PKSA content. Plastic limit increased from 40% for the natural
    soil to 47.1% at 12% PKSA content treatment. Maximum dry density (MDD) values
    decreased from 1.44Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.5Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;and
    1.65Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for the natural soil to 1.38Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
    at 10%, 1.45Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 10% and 1.56Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;at
    6%&nbsp; PKSA content for BSL, WAS and BSH compaction energy levels respectively.
    On the other hand, optimum moisture content (OMC) value decreased from 28.5% and
    22.4% for the natural soil to 22.4% and 21.0% at 12% PKSA content for BSL and
    WAS energies respectively while the value for BSH energy increased from 18.2%
    to 19.0% at 8% PKSA content. Results show that PKSA is suitable for the improvement
    of the index properties and compaction characteristics of BCS; and its beneficial
    use will reduce the attendant disposal problem on the&nbsp;&nbsp; environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
