  title: Effect of biochar-mediated treatments on the enhancement of soil acidity,
    crop performance and soil properties
  abstract: Biochar, a carbon-rich material derived from biomass pyrolysis, has gained
    considerable attention as a soil amendment for improving soil fertility and crop
    productivity. One of the key benefits of biochar is its ability to mediate soil
    acidity, influencing soil pH and buffering capacity. Biochar can act as a liming
    agent, raising soil pH in acidic soils, or as an acidifying agent, lowering pH
    in alkaline soils, through its alkaline or acidic functional groups, respectively.
    This property makes biochar a versatile tool for managing soil acidity in different
    agricultural systems. The application of biochar to acidic soils can enhance crop
    performance by improving nutrient availability, reducing toxic metal concentrations,
    and promoting microbial activity. Biochar can also increase the cation exchange
    capacity (CEC) of soils, leading to improved nutrient retention and reduced leaching
    losses. Furthermore, biochar-mediated enhancement of soil pH can promote the dissolution
    of minerals and the release of essential plant nutrients, such as phosphorus,
    calcium, and magnesium, which are often limited in acidic soils. Apart from influencing
    soil acidity and crop performance, biochar can also improve other soil properties.
    Biochar can enhance soil water holding capacity, reduce soil erosion, and increase
    aggregate stability, thereby improving soil structure and fertility. Biochar can
    also sequester carbon in the soil, contributing to climate change mitigation by
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this review, we summarize the current state
    of knowledge on the effects of biochar on soil acidity, crop performance, and
    soil properties. Overall, biochar-mediated enhancement of soil acidity can have
    profound positive effects on crop performance and soil properties, making it a
    promising soil amendment for sustainable agriculture.
