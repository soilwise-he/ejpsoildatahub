  title: Impact Of Biofield Energy Treatment On Soil Fertility
  abstract: Measurement of soil components such as microbial population, minerals
    and obviously the content of organic carbon play the important roles for the productivity
    of crops and plants. The present study was attempted to evaluate the impact of
    Mr. Trivedi's biofield energy treatment on soil for its physical (electrical conductivity),
    chemical (minerals) and microbial flora (bacteria and fungi). A plot of lands
    was assigned for this study with some already grown plants. This plot was divided
    into two parts. One part was considered as control, while another part was subjected
    to Mr. Trivedi's biofield energy treatment without physically touching and referred
    as treated. In the treated soil the total bacterial and fungal counts were increased
    by 546 and 617%, respectively as compared to the untreated soil. Additionally,
    the conductivity of soil of the treated plot was increased by 79% as compared
    to the soil of control plot. Apart from microbes, the content of various minerals
    were also changed in the biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content
    showed 2909 ppm in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to
    3943 ppm i.e. 36% increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium
    were increased by 12% and 7%, respectively as compared to the control. Besides,
    the level of some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased
    by 9%, 23%, and 41%, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical
    constituents of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8% in
    the treated soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged
    that the biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement
    in the physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component. Thus, improved
    the conductance, supportive microbes, minerals and overall productivity of crops.
    In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative way
    to increase the yield of quality crops by increasing soil fertility. This record
    was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting
    down.
