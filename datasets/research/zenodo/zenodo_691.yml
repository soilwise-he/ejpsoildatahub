  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil erosion can be accelerated byagricultural intensification,
    and the soil loss can alter the quality of water bodies. Sustainableagricultural
    production therefore requires the management of erosion and potential waterpollution.
    In Uruguay, where there is heavy use of soil for agriculture, there is a need
    tocontinually develop and update erosion management policies. In this framework,
    we estimatedthe erosion in 99 drainage basins by analyzing and managing the information
    required (K, L, S,C and R-factors) in the universal soil loss equation (USLE)
    and the revised universal soil lossequation (RUSLE) in a geographical information
    system (GIS). The studied drainage basinsencompass 73% of the area of Uruguay.
    The results include the following values: the K-factorrange from 0.0073 to 0.088
    (t ha h)(ha MJ mm) -1 , the R-factor range from 3,547 to 9,342 (MJmm)(ha h yr)
    -1 , the C-factor range from 0 to 0.155, the slope gradients are less than 4.3%
    in78% of the soils, and the multiplicative products of L and S are less than 0.73
    in 75% of thecases. The drainage basin characteristics allowed the identification
    of 4 homogeneous regionsbased on their erosion behavior. The northern-western-southern
    basins cluster and Sierrasdel Este basins clusters indicate the possibility of
    managing their erosion through control ofvegetation cover, which is represented
    by the C-factor. In general, this forecast of soil erosionby water (92.9% of the
    soil polygons and 99.9% of the drainage basins) indicates a mean soilloss of less
    than 7 t (ha yr) -1 corresponding to the land cover surveyed in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;'
