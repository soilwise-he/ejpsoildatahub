  title: Archaeology and Soil Science in Flanders. Personal reflections of an archaeologist
    anno 2019.
  abstract: This paper presents some of the personal reflections of an archaeologist
    who studied soil sciences at Ghent University in the 1980s. The paper focuses
    on how soil science, amongst other sciences, gradually found its place in archaeological
    practice in Flanders, in part thanks to opportunities and activities at Ghent
    University between 1984 and 2005. Nowadays, the curricula/ educational programmes
    of the universities in Flanders do not at all stimulate the interaction between
    soil sciences and archaeology. This feels like a setback, back to the pre-1984
    era, which is unfortunate, as earth scientists familiar with archaeology are needed
    more than ever for archaeological fieldwork in 21<sup>st</sup> century Flanders.
