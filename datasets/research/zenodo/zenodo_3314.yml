  title: Soil Moisture Regulation In Irrigated Agriculture
  abstract: 'Seepage capillary anomalies in the active layer of soil, related to the
    soil water movement, often cause variation of soil hydrophysical properties and
    become one of the main objectives of the hydroecology. It is necessary to mention
    that all existing equations for computing the seepage flow particularly from soil
    channels, through dams, bulkheads, and foundations of hydraulic engineering structures
    are preferable based on the linear seepage law. Regarding the existing beliefs,
    anomalous seepage is based on postulates according to which the fluid in free
    volume is characterized by resistance against shear deformation and is presented
    in the form of initial gradient. According to the above-mentioned information,
    we have determined: Equation to calculate seepage coefficient when the velocity
    of transition flow is equal to seepage flow velocity; by means of power function,
    equations for the calculation of average and maximum velocities of seepage flow
    have been derived; taking into consideration the fluid continuity condition, average
    velocity for calculation of average velocity in capillary tube has been received.'
