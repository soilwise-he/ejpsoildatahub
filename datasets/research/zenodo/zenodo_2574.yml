  title: Influence of three carbamate pesticides on Mn and Fe status of saline sodic
    soil of Aligarh. Part-I
  abstract: "Chemistry Department, D. S. College, Aligarh-202 001, India <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 25 July 2000, revised 3 December 2001. accepted 15 February 2002</em>\
    \ The present study envisages the effect of different doses of three carbamate\
    \ pesticides, namely, methyl NN'-dimethyl-N-(nethyl\xADcarbamoyl)oxythiooxamimidate\
    \ (Oxamyl) (I), S-ethyl-<em>N</em>-(methylcarbamoyl)oxythioacetamidate (II) and\
    \ <em>N</em>-pheny1(1-ethylcar\xADbamoyl)propylcarbamatea (III) on the change\
    \ in concentration of different forms of Mn and Fe status; change in pH, EC and\
    \ redox potential (E<sub>h</sub>) of a saline soil over a period of 90 days. The\
    \ correlation coefficients amongst them are also calculated. The results reveal\
    \ that there is an optimum effect on the water-soluble, exchangeable, active Mn;\
    \ exchangeable and available Fe; EC and Eh, with 0.25 g kg<sup>-1</sup> soil of\
    \ pesticide I; 0.2 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of pesticide II and 0.3 g kg<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ soil of pesticide III after 30 days of application. The pH was found to decrease\
    \ with the time upto 30 days. The water-soluble, exchangeable, active Mn; exchangeable,\
    \ available Fe, El, and EC were positively correlated with each other, while negatively\
    \ correlated with reducible Mn and pH. The results have been explained on the\
    \ basis of chemical and microbial activity of pesticides in soils. The activity\
    \ of carbamate pesticides is in the order, II &gt; I &gt; III."
