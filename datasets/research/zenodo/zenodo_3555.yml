  title: Study on the Stabilization of Lead in Soil with Phosphate Rock
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT


    This study selected the most representative agricultural soil in Taiwan, prepared
    the Pb-contaminated soil via manual simulation, and added phosphate rock to the
    soil, whereby it could be used as a material for restoring Pb-contaminated soil.
    The objective is to explore the release of Pb in the simulated Pb-contaminated
    soil washed with various extractants and compare the results. Additionally, this
    study explores the release of Pb in test soil after appropriate amounts of phosphate
    rock were added to it.


    First, the pH of the test soil, Lp series soil, indicates that it is strongly
    acidic because its parent material is rich in iron and aluminum oxides. The soil
    has a greater specific surface area compared to many clay minerals in Taiwan.
    This study conducted FE-SEM and EDS observation of the surface structure of the
    Pb-contaminated Lp series soil. The findings show that Al, Si, P, Ca, and Fe in
    the Lp series soil belong with elements adjacent to Pb. Regarding amounts of Pb
    released in the simulated Pb-contaminated soil washed with four extractants, the
    one washed with 0.05 M EDTA contains the highest amount of Pb released in it,
    i.e., approximately 76.6%; this high-efficient release of Pb may have to do with
    the complexation of EDTA. As for the release of Pb in the Lp series soil after
    phosphate rock was added to it, it reduces as the amount of phosphate rock added
    to it increases. This result suggests that an increase in the pH of the soil affects
    the stability of lead. In other words, when the pH of the soil solution increases,
    the stability of Pb in soil increases via ion exchange and complex reaction on
    soil surface.'
