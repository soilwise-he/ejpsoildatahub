  title: Effects of lime and sewage sludge on the relationship between tree cover
    and pasture production in a silvopastoral system on acid soil
  abstract: 'Agroforestry systems include sustainable land management techniques that
    are promoted

    by the EU (Council Regulation 1698/2005) and are considered by farmers of different

    European countries as a management system to implement. Silvopastoral production
    systems

    depend on forest species development and tree density established, but also on
    soil

    fertilization management practices, which may modify the tree-pasture relationship.
    Pinus

    radiata is broadly used in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Spain and it is
    a fast-growing

    species with a very dense canopy that could limit pasture production if planted
    at a high

    density. One of the main factors limiting pasture productivity on forestlands,
    especially at

    early plantation stages, is the low soil fertility, making it necessary to add
    products to overcome

    the acidity of the soils and the low nutrient availability. The aim of this study
    was to

    evaluate the relationship between tree cover and pasture production in a Pinus
    radiata stand

    developed on a very acid soil. The results obtained showed a negative linear relationship

    between litterfall biomass and pasture production and positive relationship between
    litterfall

    biomass and tree height.'
