  title: Evaluation of Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Stabilization of Cohesionless
    Sandy Soil for Transportation Infrastructure
  abstract: Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is generally used to stabilize cohesionless
    sandy soils that are often found in coastal areas. Due to its high carbon footprint,
    many studies are being conducted to identify a suitable green alternative for
    stabilizing cohesionless soils. Previous studies have shown that partially replacing
    OPC with waste materials such as nano-silica and coal waste reduces the overall
    carbon footprint without significantly impacting the performance. Geopolymer (GP)
    received a lot of attention in the past few decades owing to its similar properties
    to that of OPC yet with a lower carbon footprint. This study investigated the
    feasibility of stabilizing cohesionless sandy soils with metakaolin-based GP.
    Engineering and characterization tests such as shrinkage, strength, pH, scanning
    electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed
    to evaluate various characteristics of the stabilized mixes with different dosages
    of geopolymer and relate them to microstructural changes. Notably, GP-treated
    soils did not deteriorate during the durability tests, whereas the OPC-treated
    soil only retained about 75% of its strength. This is an indication that GP could
    be a better choice than OPC in coastal areas where cohesionless soils often experience
    heavy rainfall and flooding. Overall, an optimum dosage of GP improved both the
    mechanical properties and durability of cohesionless soils.
