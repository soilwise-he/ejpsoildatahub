  title: Digital mapping of soil properties with application for sustainable intensification
    of agriculture in Cameroon
  abstract: "Although soil survey is required to guide agricultural land use planning\
    \ and management in Cameroon, attention on it has been limited, thus creating\
    \ gaps in soil resource inventory. However, with the availability of well compiled\
    \ legacy soil data, nationwide reliable thematic soil properties maps, with high\
    \ accuracy can be produced using digital soil mapping tools, and effectively used\
    \ to guide decision making in agroecosystems. This study aimed at investigating\
    \ the applicability of digital soil mapping (DSM) methods on legacy soil data\
    \ for inventorying soil resources at 1-ha spatial resolution in Cameroon. Specific\
    \ objectives were to (i) rescue, compile and harmonize the soil profile database;\
    \ (ii) assess and map the distribution of some key soil properties (pH, Ca, Mg,\
    \ K, SOC, N, P, CEC, Sand, Silt, Clay, and textural classes); (iii) assess the\
    \ countrywide distribution of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) down to 100 cm\
    \ depth, and (iv) appraise the DSM methodology for applications in sustainable\
    \ intensification of cocoa production in Cameroon. The spatial distribution of\
    \ soil properties was predicted using machine learning algorithms at internationally\
    \ recognized standard soil depths (0 \u2013 5 cm, 5 \u2013 15 cm, 15 \u2013 30\
    \ cm, 30 \u2013 60 cm, 60 \u2013 100 cm, and 100 \u2013 200 cm). The harmonized\
    \ soil profile database (Camsodat 0.1) contains currently about 5250 layers which\
    \ are unevenly distributed over 1600 georeferenced positions across the country.\
    \ Prediction models estimated the national distribution of soil properties, with\
    \ good performances (R2 up to 68%). Terrain and climate attributes were the most\
    \ relevant environmental factors to predict soil properties distribution across\
    \ the Country. The national distribution of SOCS was consistent with the pattern\
    \ of agroecological zones. In total, about 5.67 Pg of SOCS is stored in the first\
    \ 100 cm depth of soil in Cameroon, with 50% in the top 30 cm depth. Land evaluation\
    \ revealed pieces of soils suitable for cocoa-production with varying levels of\
    \ suitability and requiring site-specific management approaches. Generally, for\
    \ cocoa production, 9%, of the area is highly suitable, 78% moderately suitable,\
    \ and 13% marginal suitable. Five (5) soil properties mostly affecting cocoa productivity\
    \ in decreasing order of importance are OC &gt; Clay &gt; Mg &gt; pH &gt; Silt.\
    \ Although there are some gaps in soil survey across Cameroon, DSM showed a high\
    \ potential to close such gaps, and the versatility in determining SOCS down to\
    \ 100 cm depth and applicability in soil suitability analysis for intensification\
    \ of cocoa production in Cameroon."
