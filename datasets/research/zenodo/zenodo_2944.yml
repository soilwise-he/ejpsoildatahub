  title: 'Elucidating woody vegetation patterns in relation to soil and topography
    in tropical Africa: the case of Nech Sar National Park (Ethiopia)'
  abstract: "&lt;b&gt;Background and aims&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Although soils and topography\
    \ are reported to be key factors determining vegetation patterns, there are very\
    \ few studies on this topic in tropical Africa. Given the young nature of the\
    \ soils of Nech Sar National park, we hypothesised that the woody vegetation would\
    \ be related to both topsoil and subsoil characteristics. As topography also determines\
    \ soil characteristics, we investigated whether soil and topography could be considered\
    \ independently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods &lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Abundance of woody\
    \ plant species was measured in 19 stratified randomly selected plots of 20 m\
    \ \xD7 20 m. At the centre of each plot a soil profile pit was dug and samples\
    \ were taken from each horizon. Topographic characteristics were derived from\
    \ a 30 m \xD7 30 m digital elevation model. TWINSPAN and Detrended Correspondence\
    \ Analysis (DCA) were used to identify major patterns in species composition.\
    \ Factor Analysis was used to assess the variability of, and correlation between,\
    \ the soil characteristics. Differences between the vegetation groups in-terms\
    \ of stand and environmental characteristics was tested with the Mann-Whitney\
    \ U test. DCA axes describing the major variation in vegetation patterns were\
    \ correlated with soil and topographic characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 Forest vegetation was found on Fluvisols and Gleyic Cambisols while bushland\
    \ was found on Andosols and Vertic Cambisols. The vegetation gradient from forest\
    \ to bushland (DCA-1) was correlated with both topsoil and subsoil characteristics\
    \ reflecting parent material and alkalinity; these could however not be dissociated\
    \ from topography. In contrast, variation both within the forest and the bushland\
    \ (DCA-2) was not correlated with environmental characteristics. We attribute\
    \ this variation to disturbances such as collection of firewood or logging, and\
    \ to the absence of large browser or scarcity of wildfires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 This study calls for giving equal attention to topsoil and subsoil for\
    \ elucidating woody vegetation patterns. Though vegetation patterns vary with\
    \ topography, a comprehensive understanding requires insights into soils."
