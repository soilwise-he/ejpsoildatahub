  title: Organic carbon nature determines the capacity of organic amendments to adsorb
    pesticides in soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The spread of organic pollutants from soil to other environments
    is one important source of environmental pollution. The addition of organic amendments
    to soil is an interesting strategy to control pollutants leaching. However, the
    contribution of different carbon types of organic amendments to organic pollutants
    adsorption is not clear. Hence, the objective of this work was to determine the
    role of carbon types of organic amendments into the adsorption of four herbicides.
    To this extent, organic amendments were characterized by elemental analysis and&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR
    and adsorption&ndash;desorption isotherms of herbicides by the organic amendments
    and two soils amended with them were obtained. Adsorption coefficients were correlated
    with the organic carbon content of the organic amendments and the adsorption process
    was enhanced by the hydrophobicity of herbicides and the aliphatic and aromatic
    carbon of amendments. Organic amendments increased the adsorption of herbicides
    by soils but it is not possible to extrapolate results from one soil to another
    because organo-mineral interactions between soils and organic amendments can modify
    this process. Desorption isotherms of herbicides from organic amendments and/or
    amended soils presented hysteresis indicating the irreversible adsorption of herbicides.
    Desorption results indicated, the abundance of O-alkyl and N-alkyl groups in organic
    amendments enhanced the hysteresis in amended soils&lt;/p&gt;'
