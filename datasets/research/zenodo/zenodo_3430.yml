  title: Soil Stress State Under Tractive Tire And Compaction Model
  abstract: "Soil compaction induced by a tractor towing trailer becomes a major problem\
    \ associated to sugarcane productivity. Soil beneath the tractor\u2019s tire is\
    \ not only under compressing stress but also shearing stress. Therefore, in order\
    \ to help to understand such effects on soil, this research aimed to determine\
    \ stress state in soil and predict compaction of soil under a tractive tire. The\
    \ octahedral stress ratios under the tires were higher than one and much higher\
    \ under higher draft forces. Moreover, the ratio was increasing with increase\
    \ of number of tire\u2019s passage. Soil compaction model was developed using\
    \ data acquired from triaxial tests. The model was then used to predict soil bulk\
    \ density under tractive tire. The maximum error was about 4% at 15 cm depth under\
    \ lower draft force and tended to increase with depth and draft force. At depth\
    \ of 30 cm and under higher draft force, the maximum error was about 16%."
