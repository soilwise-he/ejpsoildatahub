  title: USE OF BIO. FERTILIZERS IN CROP PRODUCTION AND SOIL FERTILITY IN UT OF JAMMU
    AND KASHMIR (INDIA)
  abstract: Modern Horticulture as well as Agriculture involves usage of pesticides
    and chemical fertilizers with an essence of increasing the worlds food production
    fertilizers, though they are vital as a nutrient supplement to plants and comprised
    mainly nitrogen (N), Potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) , Urea, etc. They also cause
    several health, hazard. Researchers have found Bio fertilizer as an excellent
    alternative to chemical fertilizers which provide nutrients through the action
    of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and trigger plant growth. The study
    reviews these continuously accessible and ecofriendly nutrients, types and their
    potential for crop production based on relevant literature and research work carried
    out by numerous researchers.
