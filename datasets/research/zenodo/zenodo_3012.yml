  title: Studies the physico-chemical parameters of water, soil and the nutritional
    values of edible cephalopods found at Digha coast, West Bengal, India
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;India is a high speed population growing country and present
    population of India is about 127 crores. Among them a huge number of our children
    have been suffering from mal nutritional diseases. They need protein feed and
    molluscs meat especially cephalopods meat is a good source of protein. India harvested
    1.73 lakh tones of cephalopods, 0.04 lakh tones of bivalves and 0.02 tones of
    gastropods from Indian marine resources like Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian
    Ocean in the year 2013 2014. The people of southern states of India consume molluscs
    meat in huge quantity as their everyday protein resource food. The local poor
    people at Digha eat occasionally only cephalopods meat. From our study for about
    last 4 years we get 12 bivalves species belonging to 5 orders, 6 families and
    8 genera out of 54 available bivalves species, 2 gastropods species belonging
    to 2 orders, 2 families and 2 genera out of 35 available gastropods species and
    4 cephalopods species belonging to 3 orders, 3 families and 4 genera out of 4
    available cephalopods species are edible. Manotosh Das | Maity Joydev &quot;Studies
