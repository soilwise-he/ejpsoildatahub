  title: ASSESSMENT OF SOLID MINERALS AND ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF ROCKS AND SOIL
    SAMPLES FROM SUKUR HILLS, MADAGALI, NIGERIA
  abstract: '<em>Mineral exploration is a critical component of any economy, and comprehensive
    geoscience data of a location provides critical information about the location''s
    mineral exploration potential. This study evaluates the mineral composition of
    the rocks and soil samples from the area covering the Sukur Hill in Madagali,
    to provide geoscience insight of the area. Untapped rock and soil samples were
    obtained from five locations and labeled as follows: Sukur east rock (SER), Sukur
    north rock (SNR), Sukur south rock (SSR), Sukur center rock (SCR) and Sukur west
    rock (SWR), as well as Sukur east soil (SES), Sukur north soil (SNS), Sukur south
    soil (SSS), Sukur center soil (SCS) and Sukur west soil (SWS) respectively. X-ray
    diffraction (XRD) was used for the identification of solid minerals while X- ray
    florescence (XRF) was used for the analyses of the elemental oxides. Six minerals
    were found in the sample locations, according to the spectroscopic analysis. These
    include: albite, annite, kaolinite, microcline, orthoclase, and quartz. Quartz
    (36.6 - 100%) was recorded in all locations of the area, while annite (4%) and
    orthoclase (33%) were only recorded in SER and SCR respectively. The soil samples
    from the area shows the presence of albite, annite, kaolinite, microcline, montmorillonite,
    quartz, rutile, tremolite, zircon, phlogopite and calcite. The major and minor
    elemental oxides in rock samples studied follow the order SiO<sub>2 </sub>&gt;
    Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> &gt; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> &gt; K<sub>2</sub>O
    &gt; SO<sub>3</sub> &gt; CaO, and BaO &gt; TiO<sub>2 </sub>&gt; P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5
    </sub>&gt; ZnO &gt; MnO respectively, while the major and minor elemental oxides
    in soil samples follow the order SiO<sub>2 </sub>&gt; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
    &gt; Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> &gt; CaO &gt; K<sub>2</sub>O &gt; MgO &gt; SO<sub>3</sub>,
    and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> &gt; TiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; BaO &gt; Zr O<sub>2 </sub>&gt;
    MnO &gt; Rb<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. The elemental oxides recorded in this
    study compliments the minerals identified in the area. The overall results from
    this study makes valuable contributions to the mineral deposit assay of the area
    and this will provide handy information for future exploration. </em>'
