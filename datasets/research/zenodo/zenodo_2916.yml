  title: 'Strip tillage: a method to limit the time needed for soil tillage in diversified
    crop systems: An example in sugar beet'
  abstract: Problem Diversified cropping systems can be time consuming for the farmer,
    finding techniques that can save farmers time is therefore a key goal. For the
    Syppre experiment in the Champagne region, France, crop diversification involves
    the use of diverse cover crops, to protect the soil, improve soil fertility, and
    store carbon. The planting of crops and cover crops must be always done under
    favourable conditions, and some crops such as sugar beet need deep soil loosening.
    This means more time spent for soil tillage and drilling, with possible conflicts
    between primary interventions and risks of emergence failure. Solution Strip tilling
    to loosens soils layers in 25cm wide rows that are to be drilled, and keeps the
    45cm wide inter-rows untouched. It simplifies soil tillage, reduces work time
    and energy consumption, and protects the soil by keeping a living cover crop or
    residues on the surface. It is applied in the Syppre innovative system on light
    chalky soils, for both sugar beet and rapeseed.
