  title: 'Impacts of deforestation on selected soil fertility status: the case of
    Cheliya District, West Shoa Zone, Oromia national regional state, Ethiopia'
  abstract: The objective was to assess impacts of deforestation on selected soil
    fertility status in Chellia District, West Shoa zone of Oromia Regional National
    State, Ethiopia. The experiment was undertaken in selected deforested areas for
    soil fertility status by descriptive cross-sectional method which describes and
    obtains relevant and various forms of data concerning the existing current status
    of the study area. The data for the study were collected through field observation
    and laboratory test. Two representative composite soil samples were collected
    in zigzag manner from the upper (0-20 cm) depth of the top soil from the forest
    and deforested lands. The study was mainly focused on analyzing the soil physicochemical
    and fertility status between forest and deforested lands. The cumulative values
    of deforestation were decreasing the marginal status of soil nutrients, showing
    that the overall soil condition in the deforested land was deteriorating and getting
    below the condition of the soils under the forest lands. The comparisons between
    the forest and deforested lands revealed a highly significant difference on major
    soil fertility parameters. Therefore, there is a need to develop sustainable forest
    management and practicing afforestation and reforestation programs to overcome
    the deterioration of soil fertility of the present study area.
