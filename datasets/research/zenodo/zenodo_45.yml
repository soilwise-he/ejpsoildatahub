  title: SOIL ANALYSIS - MANAGEMENT OF SOIL PRODUCTIVITY AND YIELD BY AGROCHEMICAL
    CARTOGRAM
  abstract: <em>Chemical farming is an important means of increasing crop yields and
    is the most cost-effective way to accelerate agricultural production. After the
    independence of our country, as in other sectors of the economy, radical changes
    have taken place in the agricultural system. Particular attention has been paid
    to providing our people with high-quality grain and grain products, and the area
    under cereals on irrigated lands has been expanded. As a result, the system of
    crop rotation of cotton and alfalfa, which is widely used in agriculture of the
    republic, has been replaced by the system of crop rotation of cotton and grain
    crops. This, in turn, has led to some problems with soil fertility.</em>
