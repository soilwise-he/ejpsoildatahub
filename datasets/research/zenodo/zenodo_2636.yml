  title: The Effects of Biochar and Farm Yard Manure on Soil Properties and Crop Growth
    in the Himalayan Agroforestry System
  abstract: Many parts of South Asia are facing agricultural land degradation and
    reduced productivity while the population continues to grow and demand for food
    is ever-increasing. This paper presents the results of research specifically focused
    on application of biochar and Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 5t/ha and 20t/ha, respectively
    as an amendment on degraded soil in a coffee agroforestry system of the mid-hills
    in the Nepal Himalaya. The study showed that there were significant (P&lt;0.05)
    positive effects on soil chemical properties, crop growth (height) and crop productivity.
    In particular, the soil pH and SOM increased significantly, while other soil properties
    were not significantly improved. Also, plant growth increased dramatically with
    application of biochar, however, crop yields showed only slight increases. It
    is suggested that biochar applied at low rates along with FYM generally has immediate
    positive effects on the vegetative growth of plants, however, soil properties
    and overall crop yields may take a longer time to show improvement. Soil biophysical
    and chemical quality is critically important for sustaining the crop productivity
    and protecting the environment.
