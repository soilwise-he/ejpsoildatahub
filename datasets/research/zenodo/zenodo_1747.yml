  title: A bioinformatic analysis of the fungi growing on biodegradable plastics mulch
    in agricultural soil
  abstract: 'For seventy years, plastic pollution of marine and terrestrial ecosystems
    has steadily grown, with widely documented detrimental effects on ecosystems(Windsor
    et al., 2019). Plastics accumulate in the environment due to the fact that they
    generally are not biodegradable. This is why the FAO calls for a wider use of
    biodegradable plastic(<em>Assessment of agricultural plastics and their sustainability:
    A call for action</em>, 2021) despite that the effects of biodegradable plastic
    on the environment are not yet know. This study looked at the fungi found on poly(butylene
    succinate-co-adipate)(PBSA) mulch using bioinformatic methods and assessing how
    well these methods perform. This study found <em>Botrytis cinerea</em> to be the
    most prominent fungi on the mulch opposed the expected result of <em>Tetracladium</em>.
    Whilst these different results are promising the current bioinformatic are not
    accurate enough yet to give definite proof. As Eukrep and Whokaryote were able
    to find equal amounts of fungal sequence in the samples but half of their sequences
    were unique to one and other. Resulting in their alignment only reaching 0.2%
    coverage of the <em>Botrytis cinerea </em>genome. Which is not high enough to
    give a conclusion on which fungi grow on biodegradable plastics in agricultural
    soil.'
