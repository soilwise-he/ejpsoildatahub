  title: Soil supplementation with Si, B and Zn and their synergetic effects in reducing
    severity of wheat blast (Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Wheat blast (&lt;em&gt;Magnaporthe oryzae&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Triticum)
    in Bangladesh and South America is recognized as one major limiting factor of
    wheat production. Its control using chemical pesticides raises concerns about
    food safety and pesticide resistance, which have dictated the need for alternative
    blast management approach, nutrient supplementation could be an ecofriendly alternative.
    Experiments were carried out under confined net house condition for two consecutive
    cropping seasons. Single doses of the nutrients (Si, B and Zn) were incorporated
    during soil preparation. Plants of the wheat blast susceptible variety BARI Gom-26
    were inoculated with spores (1 x 107 spores ml-1) of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Magnaporthe
    oryzae&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Triticum at blast vulnerable pre-heading stage of 52 days
    age. Typical wheat blast symptoms of spike bleaching from top to downward appeared
    on sight 14 days after inoculation i.e., 66 days age of the crop. Incidence and
    severity of blast bleaching of spike were scored for four times starting from
    68 days age @ three day&rsquo;s interval. None of the nutrients could stop the
    incidence of blast on wheat; however, some nutrients reduced the blast incidence
    significantly. Solo application of Si, B and Zn or combination of two caused significant
    reduction of spike bleaching. With the mixed application of Si, B and Zn, &gt;
    47% reduction of wheat blast severity was obtained. The results revealed that
    the soil application of silicon, zinc and boron had a synergistic effect on the
    intensity of blast disease of wheat.&lt;/p&gt;'
