  title: Evaluation of Soil Temperature, Water Productivity and Agronomic Performance
    of Potato (Solanum Tuberosum L.)-Legume Intercropping System in the Western Highlands
    of Cameroon
  abstract: "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intercropping\
    \ is a farming practice involving two or more crop species, growing simultaneously\
    \ in the same area and which could efficiently utilize natural resources. A two-year\
    \ study was conducted during 2021 and 2022 in the western highlands of Cameroon\
    \ to examine the impacts of potato-legume intercropped on soil water content (SWC),\
    \ productivity and&nbsp; soil&nbsp; temperature(ST) in order to identify cropping\
    \ systems (CS) that controls ST &nbsp;and water productivity (WP). A randomised\
    \ complete block design with seven treatments: sole potato crop (T1), &lt;i&gt;Mucuna&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ (T2), lima bean (T3), cowpea (T4) and intercropping systems of &lt;i&gt;Mucuna&lt;/i&gt;+potato\
    \ (T5), lima bean+potato (T6) and cowpea+potato (T7) was used. CS has a significant\
    \ effect (P&lt;0.05) on ST with the lowest ST being obtained in T5 (19.50\xB0\
    C), T7 (19.66\xB0C) and T6 (19.68\xB0C) against 20.20\xB0C in T1. SWC varied with\
    \ CS (P&lt;0.05) with T1 having the lowest SWC of 40% versus T5 (47.90%), T6 (44.42%)\
    \ and T7 (42.76%). Water use increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) with T1 (783.34mm)\
    \ and decreased from T7 (783.32mm) to T5 (783.30mm). As for WP, T1 (2.96g.mm-1)\
    \ recorded the lowest value and T5 (4.04g.mm-1) the highest. T5 had the highest\
    \ tuber yield (29.60t.ha-1) and T1 the lowest (23.21t.ha-1). Legume grain yield\
    \ and biomass were highest in T5 (2.10t.ha-1 and 6.78t.ha-1 respectively) compared\
    \ to others intercropping systems. The intercropping systems obtained an overall\
    \ LER and WER greater than 1 with the highest in T6 (6.20 and 2.63). &nbsp;Intercropping\
    \ potato with &lt;i&gt;Mucuna &lt;/i&gt;or lima bean reduces soil temperature\
    \ while improving soil water productivity that enhances potato production.&lt;/p&gt;"
