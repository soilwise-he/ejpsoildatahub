  title: Jamaica Seeds (Hibiscus Sabdariffa L.) As Bioindicator Of Toxicity In Hydrocarbon
    Contaminated Soil
  abstract: "Hydrocarbon contaminated soil is a global problem. In Mexico, the regulations\
    \ for environmental protection do not include any bioindicators to evaluate toxic\
    \ effects in microorganisms and plants caused by hydrocarbons. The jamaica plant\
    \ (<em>Hibiscus sabdariffa</em> L.) has a percentage of germination that is greater\
    \ than 90%, and nascence occurs between 2 to 3 days. Thus, the objective was to\
    \ verify whether the jamaica plant would be a viable bioindicator of toxicity\
    \ in soil contaminated by hydrocarbons. In the toxicity bioassay, three hydrocarbon\
    \ concentrations were tested: 895 ppm (T1), 447 ppm (T2), 223 ppm (T3) and a control\
    \ without hydrocarbon (C), for two soils at the coast of Oaxaca, M\xE9xico (Bajos\
    \ de Coyula and Barra de la Cruz). The germination index (GI) that integrates\
    \ the relative percentage of germination (RPG) and the relative root growth (RRG)\
    \ was determined. The following relationship was obtained: lower value at higher\
    \ hydrocarbon concentration, in the indices that were tested. Inhibition in seedling\
    \ height was lower than in root growth; while in the root growth up to 73.4% was\
    \ inhibited, in the seedling height only 6% (T3) and 48% (T1) were inhibited.\
    \ GI mean in Barra de la Cruz (43.7) was 1.1 times greater compared to Bajos de\
    \ Coyula (39.3). Partial reduction of oxygen and lack of moisture in the soil\
    \ matrix could be the possible causes of the negative effect on germination due\
    \ to hydrocarbon. GI of the jamaica, was negatively affected by the hydrocarbon\
    \ in soil, but, germination was not completely inhibited. Based on these observations,\
    \ we suggest that the jamaica plant (<em>Hibiscus sabdariffa</em> L.) can be used\
    \ as a bioindicator of toxicity in hydrocarbon contaminated soil."
