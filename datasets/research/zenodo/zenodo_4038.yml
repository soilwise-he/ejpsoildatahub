    \ Region \u2013 Identification, Characterization And Antibacterial Properties\
    \ Of Streptomyces Pas 9"
  abstract: The actinobacterial strains were isolated from the soil sediments of estuary
    region in Puducherry. The isolated strains of Actinobacteria were screened for
    antimicrobial activities and the strain (actinobacterial strain PAS9) which proved
    a broad spectrum activity was further selected for detailed biochemical characterizations.
    The findings confirmed that the selected strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces
    group. In this study, in addition to the evaluation of the antibacterial activity
    of the selected strain against a battery of common human pathogens, the strain
    is to be molecularly evaluated by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene.
