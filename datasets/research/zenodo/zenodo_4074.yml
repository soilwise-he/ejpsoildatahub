  title: Effect Of Cocoa Pod Ash And Poultry Manure On Soil Properties And Cocoyam
    Productivity Of Nutrient-Depleted Tropical Alfisol
  abstract: 'An experiment was carried out for three consecutive years at Owo, southwest
    Nigeria. The objective of the investigation was to determine the effect of Cocoa
    Pod Ash (CPA) and Poultry Manure (PM) applied solely and their combined form,
    as sources of fertilizers on soil properties, leaf nutrient composition, growth
    and yield of cocoyam. Three soil amendments: CPA, PM (sole forms), CPA and PM
    (mixture), were applied at 7.5 t ha<sup>-1</sup> with an inorganic fertilizer
    (NPK 15-15-15) at 400 kg ha<sup>-1 </sup>as a reference and a natural soil fertility,
    NSF (control), arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications.
    Results showed that soil amendments significantly increased (p = 0.05) corm and
    cormel weights and growth of cocoyam, soil and leaf N, P, K, Ca and Mg, soil pH
    and organic carbon (OC) concentrations compared with the NSF (control). The mixture
    of CPA+PM treatment increased corm and cormel weights, plant height and leaf area
    of cocoyam by 40, 39, 42, and 48%, respectively, compared with inorganic fertilizer
    (NPK) and 13, 12, 15 and 7%, respectively, compared with PM alone. Sole or mixed
    forms of soil amendments showed remarkable improvement in soil physical properties
    compared with NPK and the NSF (control). The mixture of CPA+PM applied at 7.5
    t ha<sup>-1</sup> was the most effective treatment in improving cocoyam yield
    and growth parameters, soil and leaf nutrient composition.'
