  title: Evaluating the Symbiotic Effectiveness of Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris
    L.) Nodulating Rhizobial Mutants on Extreme pH and High Salt Soil Conditions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The intent of this study was to evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness
    of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)-nodulating mutant rhizobia isolates to
    extreme pH and high salt soil condition around Babile, eastern Ethiopia. After
    mutagenesis, from 50 identified wild rhizobia isolates, a total of 8 mutants were
    selected based on their ability to survive at extreme salt and pH conditions.
    The nodule number of mutants were positively and significantly correlated with
    nodule dry weight (r=0.85, p&lt;0.0001) on sand culture. Six of the highly effective
    mutants were tested on unsterilized soil in controlled growth chamber. The correlation
    data on soil experiment displayed that nodule number was positively associated
    and significant (r=0.73, p&lt;0.0001) with nodule dry weight (NDW) while shoot
    dry weight (SDW) was positively correlated with present N (r=0.8, p&lt;0.0001)
    and total nitrogen content (r=0.9, p&lt;0.0001). Physiological test of mutants
    also showed that- 5 (63%) and 3 (36%) of mutants were able to grow at salt concentrations
    of 11% and 12%, respectively. Notably, 3 (38%), 4 (50%), 2 (25%), and 2 (13%)
    of the mutants were able to grow at pH 4, 11, 11.5 and 12, respectively. Only
    the mutant isolates HUCRM2D (which tolerated 12% NaCl, pH4, and pH12), HUCRM5C
    (which tolerated 12% NaCl and pH 4), HUCRM3B (which tolerated 12% NaCl) and HUCRM9C
    (which tolerated 11% NaCl) were growing successfully at the indicated extreme
    conditions. Thus, on the basis of their symbiotic effectiveness and tolerance
    to extreme environmental conditions, these mutant isolates were recommended to
    be used as candidates for future development of rhizobial inoculants of common
    bean grown under saline and extreme pH conditions&lt;/p&gt;'
