  title: Effects of Rotation of Cotton (Gossypium Hirsutum L.) and Soybean [Glycine
    Max (l.) Merr.] Crops on Soil Fertility in Elizabeth, Mississippi, USA
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The effects of cotton (&lt;em&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;L.):
    soybean [&lt;em&gt;Glycine max&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;(L.) Merr.] rotation on the soil
    fertility levels are limited. An irrigated soybean: cotton rotation experiment
    was conducted from 2012 through 2015 near Elizabeth, Mississippi, USA. The crop
    rotation sequences were included continuous cotton (CCCC), continuous soybean
    (SSSS), cotton-soybean-cotton-soybean (CSCS), cotton-soybean-soybean-cotton (CSSC),
    soybean-cotton-cotton-soybean (SCCS), soybean-cotton-soybean-cotton (SCSC). The
    crop rotation sequences were followed continuous soybean, continuous cotton, cotton
    followed by soybean, soybean followed by cotton, soybean followed by two years
    of cotton, and cotton followed by two years of soybean. A weed control treatment
    of a non-glyphosate post-emergence vs. glyphosate post emergence was used in both
    crops. Soil samples taken prior to planting each year and in 2016 showed no differences
    in cation exchange capacity, organic matter, pH, or macro nutrient levels among
    the rotations, over the five sampling periods nor weed control methods used for
    either crop.&lt;/p&gt;'
