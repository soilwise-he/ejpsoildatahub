  title: Soil and Crop management relation with water use efficiency in Dryland agriculture
  abstract: 'The problem of shortage of water to crops can be resolved by increasing
    total water supply available to plants, increasing water use relative to other
    losses and efficient management of scarce water. Biophysically, solutions to many
    of the problems will require the improvement of soil, water, and crop management
    at the field, plot, and farm level: first, to increase the capture and retention
    of incoming (rain) water; and second, to maximize the proportion of that water
    productively transpired by the crop. Dry land agriculture under rain fed conditions
    is found mainly in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. In the harsh
    environments of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and West Asia and North Africa (WANA),
    water is the principal factor limiting crop yield. A review has been carried out
    on soil and crop management research that can increase the water use efficiency.
    The WANA production systems are dominated by cereals, primarily wheat in the wetter
    and barley in the drier areas, in rotation with mainly food legumes such as chickpea,
    lentil and forage legumes. The SSA production systems are generally characterized
    by cereal/legume mixed-cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat.
    The major constraints in both regions to crop production are low soil fertility,
    insecure rainfall, and low-productive genotypes, low adoption of improved soil
    and crop management practices, and lack of appropriate institutional support.
    Different cropping systems and accompanying technologies are discussed. Results
    indicate that there is an advantage to apply these technologies but being function
    of socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. It is recommended that future research
    focuses on integrated technology development while taking into account also different
    levels of scale such as field, village, and watershed.'
