  title: Soil Classification and Crop Prediction Using Machine
  abstract: Soil classification is a major problem and a<br> heated topic in many
    countries. The world's population is<br> drastically increasing at an alarming
    rate which in turn<br> makes the demand for food crops. Farmers are forced to<br>
    block soil cultivation since their conventional methods are<br> insufficient to
    fulfil escalating needs. To optimize<br> agricultural output, farmers must understand
    the best soil<br> type for a certain crop, which has an impact on growing<br>
    food demand. There areseveral methods for categorizing<br> soil in a scientific
    way, but each has its own set of<br> disadvantages, such as time and effort. Computer-based
    soil<br> classification approaches are essential since they will aid<br> farmers
    in the field and will be quick. Advanced Machine<br> Learning technique-based
    soil classification methodologies<br> can be used to classify soil and extract
    various featuresfrom<br> it.
