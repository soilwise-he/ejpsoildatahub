  title: Predicting The Adsorptive Capacities Of Biosolid As A Barrier In Soil To
    Remove Industrial Contaminants
  abstract: 'The major environmental risk of soil pollution is the

    contamination of groundwater by infiltration of organic and inorganic

    pollutants which can cause a serious menace. To prevent this risk and

    to protect the groundwater, we proceeded in this study to test the

    reliability of a biosolid as barrier to prevent the migration of very

    dangerous pollutants as ''Cadmium'' through the different soil layers. In this
    study, we tried to highlight the effect of several parameters

    such as: turbidity (different cycle of Hydration/Dehydration),

    rainfall, effect of initial Cd(II) concentration and the type of soil.

    These parameters allow us to find the most effective manner to

    integrate this barrier in the soil. From the results obtained, we found a

    significant effect of the barrier. Indeed, the recorded passing

    quantities are lowest for the highest rainfall; we noted also that the

    barrier has a better affinity towards higher concentrations; the most

    retained amounts of cadmium has been in the top layer of the two

    types of soil tested, while the lowest amounts of cadmium are

    recorded in the bottom layers of soils.'
