  title: Biodegradation Behavior Of Cellulose Acetate With Ds 2.5 In Simulated Soil
  abstract: The relationship between biodegradation and mechanical behavior is fundamental
    for studies of the application of cellulose acetate films as a possible material
    for biodegradable packaging. In this work, the biodegradation of cellulose acetate
    (CA) with DS 2.5 was analyzed in simulated soil. CA films were prepared by casting
    and buried in the simulated soil. Samples were taken monthly and analyzed, the
    total time of biodegradation was 6 months. To characterize the biodegradable CA,
    the DMA technique was employed. The main result showed that the time of exposure
    to the simulated soil affects the mechanical properties of the films and the values
    of crystallinity. By DMA analysis, it was possible to conclude that as the CA
    is biodegraded, its mechanical properties were altered, for example, storage modulus
    has increased with biodegradation and the modulus of loss has decreased. Analyzes
    of DSC, XRD, and FTIR were also carried out to characterize the biodegradation
    of CA, which corroborated with the results of DMA. The observation of the carbonyl
    band by FTIR and crystalline indices obtained by XRD were important to evaluate
    the degradation of CA during the exposure time.
