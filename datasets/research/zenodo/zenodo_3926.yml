  title: "EFFECT OF INPUT PARAMETERS ON DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAYEY SOIL THROUGH\
    \ DYNATOR \u2013 A NON-DESTRUCTIVE TEST"
  abstract: "Abstract\_\nCurrently dynamic loading and its effects on foundation is\
    \ quite a hot topic in the field of geotechnical engineering which occurred due\
    \ to vibration effect on soil, and it is quite challenging to observe. This study\
    \ was performed on the Resonant column equipment accompanied by the software Dynator.\
    \ The usage of software needs a proper understanding and its effects on the testing\
    \ properties of soil. The previous studies of dynamically loaded soil studied\
    \ through resonant columns majorly are in the range of 1 to 2 Hz with free vibration\
    \ and forced vibration, but to start work with the soil sample and to relate the\
    \ loading properties with the literature is difficult because of the input parameters\
    \ of dynamic loading. The objective of this study is to provide how much difference\
    \ occurred in the values of shear modulus (G), damping ratio (D),\_and peak strain\
    \ amplitude (\u03B3)\_on minor changes of input values. The outputs of this research\
    \ show that shear modulus values increase linearly on change of values of initial\
    \ frequency and peak strain amplitudes decreases, while there is a minor decrease\
    \ in the Damping ratio. The acquisition channel gives linear straight values of\
    \ damping on angular and in the channel of acceleration it provides the wave type\
    \ variation in values of damping ratio.\_"
