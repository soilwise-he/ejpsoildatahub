  title: Post-Fire Soil Carbon Accumulation Does Not Recover Peatland Combustion Losses
    In Some Hydrogeological Settings
  abstract: Peatland soil carbon accumulation and peat properties along a chronosequence
    of time since fire for 26 Boreal Plains ombrotrophic bogs located in different
    hydrogeological settings. Peat carbon accumulation since most recent fire is calculated
    using the location of charcoal deposits in samples, loss on ignition and carbon
    content of peat.
