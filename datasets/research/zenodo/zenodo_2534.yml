  title: Studies on the Effect of Different Constituents of Soil Humic Acid in the
    Formation of Clay-humus Complexes
  abstract: The effect of the different constituents of soil humic acid in the formation
    of clay-humus complexes has been studied by potentiometric titrations as well
    as by analytical methods. It has been found that simpler components of humic acid,
    separated by ethanol extraction, viz., 'pure' humic acid and hymatomelanic acid,
    show a greater interaction in presence of metal ions than crude humic acid. This
    may be due to greater physical accessibility of the interacting groups and hence
    a much easier co-ordination. The two fractions, however, are equally effective
    in forming clay-humus complex, although their exchange capacities are different.
