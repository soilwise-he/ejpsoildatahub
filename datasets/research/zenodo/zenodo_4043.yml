  title: Effect Of Utilization Of Geosynthetic On Reducing The Required Thickness
    Of Subbase Layer Of A Two Layered Soil
  abstract: This paper tries to study the effect of geosynthetic inclusion on the
    improvement of the load-settlement characters of two layered soil. In addition,
    the effect of geogrid and geotextile in reduction of the required thickness of
    subbase layer in unpaved roads is studied. Considering the vast application of
    bearing ratio tests in road construction projects, this test is used in present
    investigation. Bearing ratio tests were performed on two layered soil including
    a granular soil layer at the top (as the subbase layer) and a weak clayey soil
    placed at the bottom (as the subgrade layer). These tests were performed for different
    conditions including unreinforced and reinforced by geogrid and geotextile and
    three thicknesses for top layer soil (subbase layer). In the reinforced condition
    the reinforcing element was placed on the interface of the top granular layer
    and the beneath clayey layer to study the separation effect of geosynthetics.
    In all tests the soils (both granular and clayey soil layers) were compacted according
    to optimum water content. At the end, the diagrams were plotted and were compared
    with each other. Furthermore, a comparison between geogrids and geotextiles behaviors
    on two layer soil is done in this paper. The results show an increase in compression
    strength of reinforced specimen in comparison with unreinforced soil sample. The
    effect of geosynthetic inclusion reduces by increasing the subbase thickness.
    In addition it was found that geogrids have more desirable behavior rather than
    geotextiles due to interlocking with the subbase layer aggregates.
