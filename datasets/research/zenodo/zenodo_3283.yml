  title: Stabilization Of Clay Soil Using A-3 Soil
  abstract: 'A clay soil classified as A-7-6 and CH soil according

    to AASHTO and unified soil classification system respectively, was

    stabilized using A-3 soil (AASHTO soil classification system). The

    clay soil was replaced with 0%, 10%, 20%, to 100% A-3 soil,

    compacted at both British Standard Light (BSL) and British Standard

    Heavy (BSH) compaction energy levels and using Unconfined

    Compressive Strength (UCS) as evaluation criteria. The Maximum

    Dry Density (MDD) of the treated soils at both the BSL and BSH

    compaction energy levels showed increase from 0% to 40% A-3 soil

    replacement after which the values reduced to 100% replacement.

    The trend of the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) with varied A-3

    soil replacement was similar to that of MDD but in a reversed order.

    The OMC reduced from 0% to 40% A-3 soil replacement after which

    the values increased to 100% replacement. This trend was attributed

    to the observed reduction in void ratio from 0% to 40% replacement

    after which the void ratio increased to 100% replacement. The

    maximum UCS for the soil at varied A-3 soil replacement increased

    from 272 and 770 kN/m2 for BSL and BSH compaction energy level

    at 0% replacement to 295 and 795 kN/m2 for BSL and BSH

    compaction energy level respectively at 10% replacement after which

    the values reduced to 22 and 60 kN/m2 for BSL and BSH compaction

    energy level respectively at 70% replacement. Beyond 70%

    replacement, the mixtures could not be moulded for UCS test.'
