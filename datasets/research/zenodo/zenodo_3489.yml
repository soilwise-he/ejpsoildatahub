  title: Utilization Of Fungal Species Isolated From Soil For Coir Pith Composting
  abstract: 'Coir pith, a ligno-cellulosic material formed during the extraction of
    coir fiber from coconut husks, accumulates as a waste material from coir processing
    factories causing environment and disposal problems. Naturally coir pith is rich
    in potash but low in nitrogen and phosphorous. Also it has very high amount of
    lignin and C: N ratio which makes composting process difficult and slow. Hence
    an attempt was made to isolate and identify the fungal species from soil collected
    from sewage treatment plant of PSG college of Arts and Science, Coimbatore. This
    study was also carried out to assess the coir pith composting efficiency of fungal
    species. The results of the study revealed that three fungal species were isolated
    and identified as <em>Aspergillus flavus</em>, <em>Aspergillus tubingensis</em>
    and <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> by its spore and molecular characteristics.
    Among these three fungal species <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> and <em>Aspergillus
    tubingensis</em> were used for the coir pith composting along with Panchagavya
    as natural additives. The compost quality was better in the combination of coir
    pith with <em>Aspergillus tubingensis </em>than<em> Aspergillus flavus </em>combination<em>.</em>'
