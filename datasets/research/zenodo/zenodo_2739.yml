  title: Effects of post-fire mulching with straw and wood chips on soil hydrology
    in pine forests under Mediterranean conditions
  abstract: '&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mulching is one of the most common post-fire management techniques, which
    has been widely studied at the global scale. However, more research is needed
    on the hydrological effects of mulching in forest ecosystems under Mediterranean
    semi-arid conditions. This study has evaluated water&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more

    simulator&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in Central-Eastern Spain after post-fire treatments.
    In this area, a large wildfire recently affected a&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more

    and the burned soil was mulched using wheat straw (dose of 0.3&nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
    or&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about wood chips from ScienceDirect''s AI-generated

    chips&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(2&nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on plots with two different
    slopes (about 30%, lower slope, and 50%, higher slope). The study has shown that
    the soil condition (burned control vs. soils mulched with straw or wood chips)
    and slope (lower vs. higher) did not significantly influence the water infiltration.
    However, the mean infiltration of the soils mulched with straw were higher (+40%
    and&nbsp;+&nbsp;17%, respectively) compared to both the control and the plots
    mulched with wood chips. Moreover, lower surface runoff (&minus;23%) was measured
    in the mulched soils compared to the control plots. The soil mulching with straw
    was more effective at decreasing the runoff coefficient (&minus;31%) compared
    to plots treated with wood chips (&minus;18%) and the control areas. Soil loss
    was significantly lower in plots treated using straw (&minus;87% compared to the
    burned and not treated soils) compared to wood chips (&minus;54%). Peaks of 90&ndash;95%
    of reduction in the soil loss were even recorded in the steeper soils. Finally,
    we suggest the application of wheat straw rather than wood chips, since the wheat
    straw mulch material provides a higher soil cover (on average 73% against 48%
    of wood chips) and therefore is more indicated to reduce the&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn

    response&lt;/a&gt; in burned soils, as confirmed by the lower runoff (in the average&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;16%)
    and erosion (&minus;73%) measured in this experiment on both gentler and steeper
    soils.&lt;/p&gt;
