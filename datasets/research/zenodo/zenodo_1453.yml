  title: Soil Chemical Properties And Garden Egg (Solanum Spp) Performance Under Different
    Organic Amendments
  abstract: Field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons of 2012 and
    2013 at the experimental farm of National Horticultural Research Institute Mbato
    out-Station Okigwe, Imo State, Nigeria to evaluate the effect of different organic
    amendments on some soil chemical properties and performance of five garden egg
    varieties. The treatments were five garden egg varieties (Solanum gilo,Solanum
    aethiopicum, Solanum macrocarpon, Solanum Ex-Lantan and Solanum melongena) and
    three organic amendments (cattle dung, poultry manure, pig waste) with a control
    (no manure).The experiment was a split-plot fitted in randomized complete block
    design replicated four times. Data were collected at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after transplanting
    (WAT) on plant height (cm), plant girth (cm), number of leaves, number of branches
    and leaf area, data on fruit weight/plot, numbers of fruits, fruit diameter (cm),
    fruit length (cm), length of peduncle as well as dry matter yield were also collected
    while soil samples collected from each plot before and after the experiments were   analyzed.
    The results revealed that the effect of different soil amendments and garden egg
    varieties showed significant (p&lt;0.05) interaction on some soil chemical properties,
    growth and yield performance of garden egg. Poultry manure application increased
    Nitrogen ( N) and soil  pH in plots with S. gilo, S.Ex-Lantan and S. macrocarpon
    while in plots that received cattle dung, N and organic carbon ( OC) was high
    in plots with S. aethiopicum and S. melongena . In plots treated with poultry
    manure, number of leaves, number of branches and plant height at 4, 6 and 8 WAT
    was highest in S.gilo, S.aethiopicum, S.macrocarpon and S.Ex-lantan Plots. Cattle
    dung application increased fruit girth in S.gilo, S.aethiopicum and S.macrocarpon
    plots while fruit weight and fruit length was favoured by pig waste in S.gilo
    and S.aethiopicum plots. Solanum gilo showed better performance in terms of number
    of leaves, number of fruits, fruit weight as well as quick maturity. It is therefore
    recommended for production in Okigwe zone, South Eastern Nigeria.
