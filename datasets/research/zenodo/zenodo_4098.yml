  title: Potency of Biocontrol Agents Isolated from Compost and Peat Soil of Tropical
    Peat Swamp Forest in Kalampangan Zone, Central Kalimantan
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia solani &lt;/em&gt;is a soil pathogen that causes
    diseases in wide range of hosts of agricultural, horticultural and flower crops.
    Biological control is the most promising way for the diseases management and it
    is environment friendly too. The objective of this study was to isolate and screen
    the potency of soil bacteria as biological control from various local compost
    and peat soil of tropical peat swamp forest in Kalampangan Zone, Central Kalimantan.
    Forty seven isolates from peat soil and compost were screened for biocontrol agent
    of &lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/em&gt; . &lt;em&gt;R. Solani &lt;/em&gt;Seven
    out of thirteen peat soil isolates, and six out of thirty three compost isolates
    showed antagonistic activity against in Potato Dextrose Agar. The cultivation
    of the antagonistic isolates in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) was extracted and analysed
    by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. The HPLC analyzes indicated
    that the antagonistic isolates produce an antifungal iturin A. Macroscopic observation
    of isolates colonies showed that form of their colonies were amuboid, myceloid,
    curled, circular, rhizoid, irregular and filamentous. These achievement indicate
    peat swamp forest not only offer a potential biocontrol agents of damping off
    but also provide a new source for production of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;'
