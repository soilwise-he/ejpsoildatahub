  title: Strength Comparative Analysis of Mechanical and Cement Stabilized Laterite
    Soil Used as Sub-Base in Pavement Construction
  abstract: "<em>The use of cement, asphalt, additives, and other conventional materials\
    \ to stabilize the sub base and sub grade of pavement is far from being cost-effective\
    \ due to the economic crisis, which has severely affected road construction in\
    \ Nigeria and other developing countries. Hence this research: Strength Comparative\
    \ Analysis of Mechanical and Cement Stabilized Laterite Soil used as Sub-Base\
    \ in Pavement Construction. Soil samples were obtained from University of Benin\
    \ burrow pit. Index properties and strength tests were carried out on the soil\
    \ samples, while the strength tests were carried out on the stabilized soils for\
    \ the purpose of strength comparison and evaluation of the suitability as sub\
    \ base material. For the soil samples alone, the average results obtained for\
    \ the specific gravity was 2.46; the liquid limit was 33.00%; plastic limit was\
    \ 19.21% and plasticity index was 13.79% which indicates that the soil is of medium\
    \ plasticity. From the sieve analysis, the soil was classified as an A-2-6 soil\
    \ according to AASTHO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation)\
    \ system of classification. The Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) and the Maximum\
    \ Dry Density (MDD) were 12.2% and 1.76g/cm<sup>3</sup> respectively. The maximum\
    \ value for soaked CBR was obtained as 15.69%. When the natural soil was stabilized\
    \ with cement at different percentages from 2 \u2013 10 %, the OMC ranged from\
    \ 12.6% to 14.6%, the MDD ranged from 1.72g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1.76g/cm<sup>3</sup>\
    \ and from the CBR tests, the value for the soaked CBR ranged from 24.21% to 73.74%.\
    \ When the soil was stabilized with quarry dust at percentages ranging from 15%\
    \ - 75%, the OMC ranged from 9.6% to 12.8%, the MDD ranged from 1.73g/cm<sup>3</sup>\
    \ to 1.81g/cm<sup>3</sup> and from the CBR tests, the value for the soaked CBR\
    \ ranged from 3.32% to 3.71%. The optimum mix proportion was obtained as 75%.\
    \ When the soil was stabilized with sharp sand at percentages from 20% - 100%,\
    \ the OMC ranged from 11.00% to 12.8%, the MDD ranged from 1.73g/cm<sup>3</sup>\
    \ to 1.78g/cm<sup>3</sup> and the CBR tests, the value for the soaked CBR ranged\
    \ from 5.70% to 9.21%. The optimum mix proportion was obtained as 80%. Soil stabilization\
    \ techniques with cement at percentages 6%,8% and 10% gave CBR values that met\
    \ the requirements of a good subbase course of a pavement or road in accordance\
    \ with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing specification. Quarry dust and\
    \ Sharp sand, did not meet the requirements, hence not suitable for a subbase\
    \ course. They can be used to construct local roads to be more stable and they\
    \ can also be suitable with the addition of cement or other effective binders.\
