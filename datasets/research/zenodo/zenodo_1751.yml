  title: Relationship between Metal Concentrations in Galena Ore and Soil Samples
    from Galena-rich Farmlands
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;One of the Nigerian minerals (galena ore) within galena deposit
    region in Torkula, Benue state, was characterized along with its vicinity farmland
    soils for possible relationships in their geo-physico-chemical compositions. Both
    classical (titrimetric &amp; gravimetric) and instrumental analytical techniques
    were adopted. Contamination factors revealed different categories of pollution
    by heavy metals while the metal loading in the ore and ore-rich soils shows no
    statistical difference for Pb and other key metals at p &lt; 0.05. Hence, the
    possibility of leaching of toxic metals from mineral ores, their transport and
    distribution to surrounding environment cannot be over emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;'
