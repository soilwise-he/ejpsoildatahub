  title: "An Evaluation of \u2018Vinasse\u2019 (Bio-Ethanol Effluent) and Vermicompost\
    \ as Soil Amendments for Cash Crop Production"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The indiscriminate application of various inorganic fertilizers
    has triggered many soil, water and health issues around the world. Due to the
    extent of these concerns, various forms of organic fertilizers have since been
    explored. This study sought to establish the suitability of two organic composites
    (vinasse and vermicompost) as fertilizers in cash crop production. The crops selected
    were leafy vegetables from the Class of Magnoliopsida and included&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Brassica
    rappa spp. Chinesis&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;(pakchoi),&lt;em&gt;Lactuca sativa&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;(lettuce)
    and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;var.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;capitata
    (cabbage).&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;The response of these crops to four fertilization regimes
    (control &ndash; no fertilizers, vermicompost, vinasse and NPK) were monitored.&nbsp;Upon
    harvesting, data regarding weight of plants and number of leaves were recorded
    and analyzed. There was a 35.8%, 15.6% and a 20.7% greater yield of lettuce, pakchoi
    and cabbage, when vinasse was used as the fertilizer, as compared with NPK. With
    vermicompost, there were 19.5% and 5.2% higher yields for lettuce and cabbage
    with a 15.6% reduction of yield for pakchoi as compared with NPK. Considering
    the increased yield demonstrated from this study coupled with the environmental,
    soil and crop nutrient benefits posited by other researchers, vinasse and vermicompost
    should be utilized as an organic replacement for inorganic fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;'
