  title: Assessing The Suitability Of Drainage Water For Irrigation In View Of Soil-Meliorative
    Conditions
  abstract: "The purpose of the work was to assess the suitability of drainage and\
    \ discharge waters for irrigation, taking into account soil-reclamation conditions.\
    \ Assessment of the suitability of drainage water for irrigation of agricultural\
    \ land is carried out taking into account the indicators characterizing the properties\
    \ of soils and substances entering the soil during agricultural production \u2014\
    \ nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, chlorides and sulfates.\
    \ The study of the chemical composition of drainage outflow was carried out on\
    \ the territory of Semikarakorskii district of Rostov region near Anastasiadis\
    \ farm. Within the boundaries of the study area is implemented vegetable crop\
    \ rotation: onion \u2014 medium cabbage \u2014 potatoes \u2014 late cabbage. In\
    \ 2017, the onion was grown on the territory of the plot. To predict the degree\
    \ of pollution of drainage and discharge waters it is necessary to study the dynamics\
    \ of mineralization and composition of soil solutions and soil absorbing complex,\
    \ the mechanism of fertilizer removal. Calculations showed that the concentration\
    \ of biogenic elements, for example, nitrogen, in drainage and discharge waters\
    \ depends on the doses of fertilizers, the degree of digestibility of their soil\
    \ and soil-meliorative conditions of the site."
