  title: Effect Of Different Tillage Systems On Soil Properties And Production On
    Wheat, Maize And Soybean Crop
  abstract: 'Soil tillage systems can be able to influence soil compaction, water
    dynamics, soil temperature and crop yield. These processes can be expressed as
    changes of soil microbiological activity, soil respiration and sustainability
    of agriculture. Objectives of this study were: 1 - to assess the effects of tillage
    systems (Conventional System (CS), Minimum Tillage (MT), No-Tillage (NT)) on soil
    compaction, soil temperature, soil moisture and soil respiration and 2- to establish
    the effect of the changes on the production of wheat, maize and soybean. Five
    treatments were installed: CS-plough; MT-paraplow, chisel, rotary grape; NT-direct
    sowing. The study was conducted on an Argic-Stagnic Faeoziom. The MT and NT applications
    reduce or completely eliminate the soil mobilization, due to this; soil is compacted
    in the first year of application. The degree of compaction is directly related
    to soil type and its state of degradation. The state of soil compaction diminished
    over time, tending toward a specific type of soil density. Soil moisture was higher
    in NT and MT at the time of sowing and in the early stages of vegetation and differences
    diminished over time. Moisture determinations showed statistically significant
    differences. The MT and NT applications reduced the thermal amplitude in the first
    15cm of soil depth and increased the soil temperature by 0.5-2.2<sup>0</sup>C.
    Water dynamics and soil temperature showed no differences on the effect of crop
    yields. The determinations confirm the effect of soil tillage system on soil respiration;
    the daily average was lower at NT (315-1914 mmoli m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>)
    and followed by MT (318-2395 mmoli m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) and is higher
    in the CS (321-2480 mmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). Comparing with CS, all
    the four conservation tillage measures decreased soil respiration, with the best
    effects of no-tillage. Although wheat production at MT and NT applications, had
    no significant differences soybean production was significantly affected from
    MT and NT applications. The differences in crop yields are recorded at maize and
    can be a direct consequence of loosening, mineralization and intensive mobilization
    of soil fertility.'
