  title: Determinants of Farmer's Participation in Soil and Water Conservation Practices
    in North- Central Highlands of Ethiopia
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> Soil erosion is the\
    \ major threat in the highlands of Ethiopia. Even if large number of conservation\
    \ campaigns have been undertaken, the efforts are less effective, because of low\
    \ intention to farmer\u2019s participation in soil and water conservation (SWC)\
    \ works. The objective of this study was to identify determinants of farmer\u2019\
    s participation in soil and water conservation (SWC) in Borena woreda, north-central\
    \ highlands of Ethiopia. Samples of 148 households were selected following Stratified,\
    \ proportional sampling technique. Household survey, focus group discussion, and\
    \ key informant interview methods were used to collect primary data. Secondary\
    \ data were also collected from Woreda agriculture office, published, and unpublished\
    \ documents. Both descriptive statistics and Binary logistic regression model\
    \ using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20 were used to\
    \ analyze the data. About 76.35% of the respondents were participants. However,\
    \ 57.52% of participants were without their interest. The binary logistic regression\
    \ results showed that perception, extension service, training, and slope of their\
    \ land found to have a positive and significant influence on farmer\u2019s participation.\
    \ Whereas, age of household head and off-farm income found to have negative and\
    \ significant influence on farmer\u2019s participation in SWC practices. When\
    \ farmers get extension and training service, they become willing to participate\
    \ in SWC practice because they acquire necessary information and skill. Therefore,\
    \ the Woreda Agricultural office should provide extension service and encourage\
    \ farmers training for the sustainable management of the land and its productivity."
