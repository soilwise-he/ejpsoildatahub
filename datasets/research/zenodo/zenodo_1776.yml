  title: Soil Erosion as a Function of Natural and Anthropogenic Factors and its Environmental
    Consequences
  abstract: The article examines the issues of the possibility of studying erosion
    and its control. The study proved that the development of soil erosion is based
    on the forming impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. The degree of potential
    danger and the possibility of prevention, taking into account the preservation
    of the environmental situation in the foothills of the Upper Shirvan in the example
    of the Shamakhi district of the Republic of Azerbaijan, were studied. The main
    tasks of the study were the determination of the amount and the degree of development
    of eroded and erosion-prone soils of the foothill zones, carried out on the basis
    of soil.
