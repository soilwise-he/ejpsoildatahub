  title: Different Grain Sizes of Bagasse Ash, Quarry Dust and Lime Enhances the Geotechnical
    Properties of Expansive Soil
  abstract: The term soil stabilisation refers to a way of strengthening the solidity
    or bearing capabilities of any type of soil by using managed proportioning, compaction,
    and the addition of a stabilising agent to improve the engineering properties
    of the soil using a synthetic method. Soil stabilisation involves using one-of-a-kind
    technologies to modify and improve the properties of a soil so that it can be
    stabilised. When low-cost domestically available chemicals are employed in the
    construction of sub base, sub grade, and other materials, the cost of constructing
    a pavement is significantly reduced. The minimum stipulated structural strength
    and bearing quality of the soil that will be reached for each and every layer
    of material are used to design the pavement. The stabilisation of black cotton
    soil with bagasse ash, lime, and a mixture of different grain sizes of bagasse
    ash, lime, and quarry dust was examined in this study. Various laboratory tests,
    such as atterberg limits, proctor test, and CBR (California bearing ratio test),
    are used in this study. California The soil's Bearing Ratio rises as the grain
    size of Bagasse ash grows larger.
