  title: Comparison of brown rendzina and colluvial sinkhole soil in the area of the
    National park "Una" with special emphasis on the distribution of cadmium, nickel
    and arsenic
  abstract: "The paper presents the results of a comparison of brown rendzina and\
    \ colluvial sinkhole at approximately the same altitudes and the same land use.\
    \ The sites were located in the Kalati area within the National Park \u201EUna\u201C\
    . More precisely, the places referred to the top of the sinkhole (brown rendzina\
    \ - top) and the bottom of the sinkhole (colluvial soil - bottom). The main objective\
    \ of the research, in addition to the physical and chemical parameters of soil\
    \ quality, was to determine the distribution of the total content of cadmium (Cd),\
    \ nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As). The total content of these elements werw observed\
    \ in composite samples at two depths of 0 \u2013 10 and 0 \u2013 20 cm and horizons\
    \ profile. Their total content was measured by atomic adsorption spectrometry\
    \ \u2013 AAS. The results were statistically analyzed using Kruskal - Walisovog\
    \ test at the significance level of p \u2264 0.05 using correlation coefficient\
    \ \u03C7<sup>2</sup>. The results showed a single legality of the distribution\
    \ of Cd, Ni and As in samples of soil profile, while the average soil samples\
    \ showed unique legality of the distribution of observed elements."
