  title: Investigation on the rate of horizontal spread of anthracene in a sandy clay
    soil
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, Cotton University, Guwahati-781 001, Assam,\
    \ India <em>E-mail:</em> prahash.sarma@cottonuniversity.ac.in <em>Manuscript received\
    \ online 09 May 2019, revised 10 May 2019, accepted 13 May 2019</em> Extent of\
    \ horizontal spread of anthracene in soil is examined in a 180 days experiment\
    \ under natural environment during winter and spring seasons. Here the rate of\
    \ spread is calculated from a point source in 1 m radius plot. Prior to placement\
    \ of known quantity of anthracene from outside at the center of the spot, a few\
    \ physico-chemical parameters of the soil were examined. It has been found from\
    \ HPLC analysis that a maximum of 12020 ppm of anthracene moves a distance of\
    \ 0.50 m in 60 days and a maximum of 8473 ppm moves a distance of 0.75 m in 180\
    \ days from the point source. A part of the applied PAH has undergone oxidation\
    \ producing oxygenated derivatives as evidenced from the lowering of pH and increase\
    \ of EC against time. It has been found that in a soil of 56% porosity, anthracene\
    \ moves a maximum distance of 8.33\xD710<sup>\u20133</sup> m per day where the\
    \ concentration of the point source is 5 g. With the increase of time, the concentration\
    \ of PAH in the point source decreases due to spreading and degradation of the\
    \ PAH and by180 days of the experiment maximum speed has been found to be 4.17\xD7\
    10<sup>\u20133</sup> m per day."
