  title: Influence of Fruit Based Agroforestry Systems on Soil Properties for Sustainable
    Soil Health in Hill Zone of West Bengal, India
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;A field experiment on fruit based agroforestry systems comprising\
    \ of one silvi (&lt;em&gt;Alnus nepalensis&lt;/em&gt;), two fruit trees, (&lt;em&gt;Citrus\
    \ reticulata&lt;/em&gt; Blanco. and &lt;em&gt;Pyrus communis&lt;/em&gt;) and ten\
    \ intercrops &lt;em&gt;viz &lt;/em&gt;maize, rice, french bean, pea, and pumpkin\
    \ during &lt;em&gt;kharif &lt;/em&gt;and potato, cabbage, cauliflower, mustard\
    \ and onion during &lt;em&gt;rabi&lt;/em&gt; season of two consecutive years (2013-2015)\
    \ was conducted at Dalapchand Science Farm, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Kalimpong,\
    \ West Bengal. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design (RBD) with\
    \ three replications. The fruit plant grafts were planted at spacing of 10 m x\
    \ 10 m. The silvi saplings were planted in between the two fruit plants and boundary\
    \ at spacing of 2.5 m during &lt;em&gt;kharif&lt;/em&gt; 2011. The intercrops\
    \ were grown in the interspaces between the two fruit trees during two consecutive\
    \ years. Depth wise (0-15 cm, 15-30 cm and 30-60 cm) soil samples were collected\
    \ from the field twice, once at initial (before intercropping) and next at final\
    \ (at the end of two years of intercropping) by using screw auger. Results revealed\
    \ that higher improvement in soil physico-chemical properties at 0-15 cm,15-30\
    \ cm and 30-60 cm soil depth recorded\_ &lt;em&gt;viz&lt;/em&gt;. bulk density\
    \ (1.26, 1.34, 1.37 gm&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), water\
    \ holding capacity (39.44, 35.78, 33.29%), soil pH (5.90, 6.23, 6.34), organic\
    \ carbon (2.04, 1.07, 0.81%), available N (517, 416, 319 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;),\
    \ P (14.38,12.18, 9.52 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and K (535, 349, 289 status\
    \ kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) respectively\_ were found under &lt;em&gt;Alnus\
    \ nepalensis&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;Citrus reticulata&lt;/em&gt; + pea + mustard\
    \ plot at the end of two years of study. However, among the different treatment\
    \ combination, integrating silvi (&lt;em&gt;Alnus nepalensis&lt;/em&gt;) and fruit\
    \ trees (&lt;em&gt;Citrus reticulata&lt;/em&gt; Blanco. and &lt;em&gt;Pyrus communis&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ with intercrops (&lt;em&gt;kharif&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;rabi)&lt;/em&gt; showed\
    \ significant improvement in soil physico-chemical properties than silvi and fruit\
    \ trees alone or sole crops plots.\_&lt;/p&gt;"
