  title: Soil Remediation Technologies Towards Green Remediation Strategies
  abstract: "As a result of diverse industrial activities, pollution from numerous\
    \ contaminant affects both groundwater and soils. Many contaminated sites have\
    \ been discovered in industrialized countries and their remediation is a priority\
    \ in environmental legislations. The aim of this paper is to provide the evolution\
    \ of remediation from consolidated invasive technologies to environmental friendly\
    \ green strategies. Many clean-up technologies have been used. Nowadays the technologies\
    \ selection is no longer exclusively based on eliminating the source of pollution,\
    \ but the aim of remediation includes also the recovery of soil quality. \u201C\
    Green remediation\u201D, a strategy based on \u201Csoft technologies\u201D, appears\
    \ the key to tackle the issue of remediation of contaminated sites with the greatest\
    \ attention to environmental quality, including the preservation of soil functionality."
