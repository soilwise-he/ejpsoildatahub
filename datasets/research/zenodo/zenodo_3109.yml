  title: THE EFFECT OF THE UPPER SOFTENER OF THE SLOPED COLUMN WORKING BODY WORKING
    ON THE SOIL OF GARDEN FIELDS ON THE ENERGY INDICATORS
  abstract: <em>In the article, the qualitative and energetic parameters of the upper
    softener attached to the working body with an inclined column, which works between
    the rows of the garden without a tiller, in soil cultivation are presented with
    the analysis of the theoretical and experimental studies conducted, and the calculations
    of the indicators are analyzed through formulas and graphs.</em>
