  title: Two novel species of Calonectria isolated from soil in a natural forest in
    China
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Species of Calonectria include important pathogens of numerous\
    \ agronomic and forestry crops worldwide, and they are commonly distributed in\
    \ soils of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Previous research results\
    \ indicated that species diversity of Calonectria in China is relatively high.\
    \ Most Calonectria spp. reported and described from China were obtained from diseased\
    \ Eucalyptus tissues or soils in Eucalyptus plantations established in tropical\
    \ and subtropical areas in southern China. Recently, a number of Calonectria isolates\
    \ were isolated from soils in a natural forest in the temperate region of central\
    \ China. These isolates were identified by DNA sequence comparisons for the translation\
    \ elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), histone H3 (his3), calmodulin (cmdA) and \u03B2\
    -tubulin (tub2) gene regions, combined with morphological characteristics. Two\
    \ novel species of Calonectria were identified and described, and are named here\
    \ as Calonectria lichi and Ca. montana, which reside in the Prolate Group and\
    \ Sphaero-Naviculate Group, respectively. This study revealed that more species\
    \ of Calonectria may occur in natural forests in central China than previously\
    \ suspected.&lt;/p&gt;"
