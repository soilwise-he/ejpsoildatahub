  title: Effect of Some Ecological Factors on Occurrence of Yeasts in Soil and Sediment
    from Iraq
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is one of the favorable habitat for microorganism. It considered
    being the home of wide range of them in particularly, bacteria and fungi. Southern
    Iraq is characterized by a multiplicity of ecosystem, which include desert, agricultural
    and marine areas, each of which has special composition that differs from the
    neighboring system, whether in terms of vegetation or various environmental factors.
    This in diversity, in turn, may lead to microbial diversity that can be used in
    different biotechnologies. Regarding that little is known about yeast diversity
    in such habitats, and therefore the current study aims to assess the yeast community
    in soil and sediments samples from Basrah and Dhi-Qar provinces, Southern Iraq.
    Thirty-one species belong to 19 genera were encountered. The isolated species
    consist of 16 species of Ascomycota and 15 species of Basidiomycota. The soil
    of Basrah and Dhi-Qar support the growth of diverse species belonged to the genera&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Aureobasidium&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cutaneotrichosporon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Debaryomyces&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Filobasidium
    Geotrichum&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hanseniaspora&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lodderomyces&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Meyerozyma,Symmetrospora&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Torulaspora&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Vishniacozyma&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Pichia&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;Yarrowia&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cystobasidium&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Galactomyces&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rhodotorula&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wickerhamomyces&lt;/em&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Candida&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Naganishia.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;One
    hundred and twelve fungal isolates were identified using the conventional methods
    depending on morphological characteristics. CHROMagar candida was used as differential
    culture medium. Iodine stain was used to differentiate ascospores and basidiospores.
    In addition biochemical method represented by VITEK was used as well as molecular
    identification. This study represents the first report of occurrence of yeast
    species in soil and surface sediment samples from Basrah and Dhi-Qar provinces,
    Southern, Iraq, with effect of some ecological factors on isolation yeast from
    different location.&lt;/p&gt;'
