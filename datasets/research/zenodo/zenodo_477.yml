  title: Impact of Soil Microbes in Sustainable Agriculture Development
  abstract: "Aggregate of potential microorganisms in the soil emerged as vital components\
    \ for sustainable agriculture production. Some of the beneficial microorganism\
    \ plays crucial role in the plant growth promoting activities like fixation, mineralization,\
    \ solubilization, and mobilization of nutrients.\_ In addition, release of the\
    \ plant growth\u2013promoting substances such as auxin and gibberellin hormones,\
    \ mediated by interactions between host plant roots and microbes in the rhizosphere.\
    \ Some of the plant species have been identified for symbiotic association with\
    \ microbes and actively involved in the supply of mineral nutrients with expense\
    \ of minimal energy. Identification, isolation and standardization of such type\
    \ of microorganism for the formulation of strategic biofertilizer play vital role\
    \ in the ecofriendly and sustainable agriculture production. Furthermore, the\
    \ probiotic microorganism like lactobacillus being used as dietary supplement\
    \ in the functional food products. Therefore, the effective uses of microbiome\
    \ accelerate the promotion of sustainable agriculture development along with environmental\
    \ safety."
