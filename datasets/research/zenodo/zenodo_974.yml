  title: Spectroscopic investigation on Red soil samples from Thiruvannamalai District,
    Tamil Nadu
  abstract: In this study, the eight different Red soil samples collected in Thiruvannamalai
    district is<br> subjected to physic-chemical and mineralogical characterizations.
    FT-IR spectroscopic technique is applied<br> to soil samples to identify the constituent
    minerals. From the infrared spectrum, the minerals are identified<br> from the
    absorption frequencies of peaks with the help of available literature. The minerals
    such as quartz<br> and clay minerals like kaolinite and montmorillonite are majorly
    present in the samples and also feldspar<br> minerals (orthoclase, microcline,
    and albite) and carbonate minerals (aragonite and calcite) and organic<br> carbon
    are identified. Few minerals like chlorite, gypsum, goethite, ilmenite, dolomite,
    magnetite, garnet,<br> hornblende, kyanite, zircon and magnesiohornblende are
    identified only in XRD analysis. The performed<br> analyses provided useful information
    about the mineralogical composition of the red soil samples. FT-IR<br> spectroscopy
    and X-ray diffraction technique seems to be useful method for the mineral analysis
    of red soil<br> samples.
