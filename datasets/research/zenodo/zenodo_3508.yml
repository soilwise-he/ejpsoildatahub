  title: Production and Purification of Amylase from Bacillus subtilis Isolated from
    Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In spite of progress in biotechnology and enzymology, the enzymes
    have been industrialized in recent years for the mounting up the product development
    in various arena. The ultimate goal of this study comprises the production and
    purification the amylase enzyme from the bacterial strain. A powerful amylase
    producer, Bacillus subtilis ISOLATE-4 was isolated, screened and identified from
    the soil sample. In order to produce extracellular amylase, various physico-chemical
    parameters were optimized. During optimization, the maximal production of amylase
    by the isolate at 48 hrs of incubation in 100 rpm was found to be 6.93U/ml, 5.94U/ml,
    6.0U/ml at 45&ordm;C, pH 6 with 1% substrate concentration respectively. Ammonium
    sulphate fractionation was done for rapid precipitation of the amylase at a concentration
    of 60% and exposed to dialysis showed the 25% purification fold of an enzyme.
    The dialyzed product was further subjected to DEAE-Cellulose column chromatography
    resulted in an increase up to 75% purification fold than crude enzyme. The amylase
    enzyme might be suitable for the liquefaction of starch, detergent, textile and
    several additional industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
