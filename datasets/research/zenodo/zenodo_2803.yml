  title: Time of application of organic matter and humic acid on transformation of
    inorganic and organic forms of N in soil

    the Division of Soil and Crop Management, ICAR-Central Soil Salinity Research

    <em>Manuscript received 08 September 2016, revised 24 April 2017, accepted 08
    May 2017</em> Irrespective of treatments and stages of incubation, comparatively
    higher amount of available N is accumulated in soil treated either with FYM or
    humic acid 21 days before than on the day of start of the experiment. Humic acid
    is decomposed faster than FYM leading to higher amount of accumulation of available
    N in humic acid treated system. In general, irrespective of treatments, hydrolysable
    NH<sub>4 </sub>+ increased over 120 days period of incubation and the amount of
    increase is more in soil treated either with FYM or humic acid on the day of start
    of the experiment. However, a reverse trend of results is obtained for amino acid
    N in soil. Hydrolysable NH<sub>4</sub> + and amino acid N are more prone to mineralization
    than any other organic forms of N in soil.'
