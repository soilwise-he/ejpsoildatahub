  title: EFFECT OF SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION ON SELF-SUPPORTING AND GUYED CHIMNEY
  abstract: In the present study, 72m tall self-supporting and guyed chimneys are
    analysed for earthquake and wind loads considering three different soil conditions
    using SAP2000. Earthquake analysis is performed as per IS 1893-2016 and wind analysis
    is done as per IS 875(Part 3)-2015. Three methods, i.e., Seismic coefficient method,
    Response spectrum method &amp; time history method are used for the seismic analysis.
    The response of chimney is derived in the form of displacement and base shear
    for different soil conditions. From the study, it is concluded that underlying
    soil plays important role on dynamic behaviour of tall self-supporting and guyed
    chimneys.
