  title: Mapping Study of the soil occupation by vegetation in Filfila region (North-east-Algeria)
  abstract: The aim of our work is to map land cover by vegetation in the Filfila
    region (Skikda, north-east Algeria); in our study, we used aerial photos by ETM
    + satellite LAND SAT7. The results were used to develop a physiognomic vegetation
    map of the region (cork oak and zeen oak training, olive tree, dense scrub, clear
    scrub, culture and urban). The digital terrain model obtained after processing
    SETM data has established the slope map, 3D presentation, the map displays and
    map elevations of the study area
