  title: Soil Moisture Sensor and Temperature Sensor Based Automatic Irrigation System
  abstract: <em>The soil, fertilisers, and water all play a role in how productive
    a crop is. The fertilisers offer micronutrients like nitrogen, zinc, and other
    nutrients for vegetable farming. Crops should be able to survive the negative
    impacts created by the environment and uncontrollable sources in order to supply
    the rising demand for food. The three layers in which networks are created are
    similar to the framework of smart agriculture. To obtain information about numerous
    factors, products, and working environments, there is a sensor layer. The transport
    layer allows for the communication of information from various devices as well
    as information to and from a remote server. Utilising a layer will allow you to
    examine, visualise, and anticipate the data in order to take further action. Because
    farmers require analogue data rather than digital data, the suggested method uses
    multilinear regression to anticipate the water levels and micronutrients that
    are in excess for crop cultivation. In order for them to be able to take the appropriate
    safety precautions and safeguard the field from harm. </em>
