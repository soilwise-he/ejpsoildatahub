  title: 'Ecotoxicological Studies Of Soil Using Analytical And Biological Methods:
    A Review'
  abstract: Soil is a complex physical and biological system that provides support,
    water, nutrients and oxygen to the plants. Apart from these, it acts as a connecting
    link between inorganic, organic and living components of the ecosystem. In recent
    years, presence of xenobiotics, alterations in the natural soil environment, application
    of pesticides/inorganic fertilizers, percolation of contaminated surface water
    as well as leachates from landfills to subsurface strata and direct discharge
    of industrial wastes to the land have resulted in soil pollution which in turn
    has posed severe threats to human health especially in terms of causing carcinogenicity
    by direct DNA damage. The present review is an attempt to summarize literature
    on sources of soil pollution, characterization of pollutants and their consequences
    in different living systems.
