  title: STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF SOIL CEMENT ELEMENTS WHEN STABILIZING ROADBED MODEL
    IN LABORATORY CONDITIONS
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Experimental&nbsp;studies&nbsp;allow&nbsp;determining&nbsp;th
    estress-strain&nbsp;state&nbsp;or&nbsp;bearing&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;tested
    soil body. A preliminary study of the results of model testing and experimental
    research allows us to find the optimal solutions and to justify the parameters
    of the chosen technology. The purpose of this work is to determine the effect
    of soil cement elements when stabilizing the roadbed on a weak subgrade using
    the soil tests in laboratory conditions.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;During
    the development of measures for the reconstruction and consolidation of soil bodies,
    their strength is tested using many methods. In all cases, we take into account
    the physical and mechanical characteristics of soils obtained as a result of research,
    as well as the existing regulatory documents. We performed the experimental studies
    by model testing in laboratory conditions. The model testing was based on the
    corresponding relationships between geometric sizes, mechanical properties of
    materials, loads and other factors on which the stress-strain state depends. During
    testing, the model was loaded gradually. We maintained each load level up to conditional
    stabilization of the soil deformation. We took the readings from measuring devices
    at each stage of loading after achievement of stabilization of soil mass deformations.
    We fixed the readings in the test journal.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;During
    stabilization with soil cement piles there is an improvement in mechanical properties,
    which leads to a decrease in deformations by 2&hellip;3.5 times. Each test is
    accompanied with graphs of relative deformations-stress dependence, as well as
    deformation curves and compression curves. According to the results of experimental
    stu-dies, it can be seen that when testing a model with cement piles, compared
    with a model without soil cement piles, the relative deformations of the samples
    taken prior to the experiment and after the experiment almost coincide, indicating
    a decrease in deformability under load.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Originality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We
    proved that this stabilization type positively affects the stress-strain state
    of the soil body, by increasing its physical and mechanical characteristics. The
    obtained results allow for rational design of subgrade stabilization work with
    the help of modern technologies&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt;.
    The in-depth analysis of the results of experimental studies opens up possibilities
    for theoretical synthesis and development of theoretical foundations, which will
    allow in the future avoiding, in the similar cases, the experimental verification
    of the stabilization type given for the relative type of soil. It is confirmed
    that this method of stabilization used can be applied in real conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
