  title: Effect of Rhizobium Innoculation on Growth, Nodulation Count and Yield of
    Soybeans Glycine Max Grown in Biochar Amended Soil of Sounthern Guinea Savana
    of Nigeria
  abstract: 'Replenishment of depleted soil nitrogen depends largely on addition of
    inorganic fertilizers but due to problems of scarcity and high the cost of these
    fertilizer. Rhizobia inoculation is a cheaper, easier and safer option to improve
    soilnitrogen fixation and increase productivity of grain legumes.The experiments
    were conducted during 2016 and2017 rainy season with the aimed of evaluating the
    potentials of rhizobium inoculation on growth, nodulation count and yield of soybean
    planted in biochar amended soil. The results showed that Rhizobium inoculation
    of soybeans and biochar soil amendment didnot showed any significant increase
    on allgrowth parameter at 8 weeks after planting in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons.
    However, inoculated soybeans produced significantly higher number of 25.35 and
    23.42 roots nodules per plant compare to the control. Rhizobium inoculation and
    biochar soil amendment had a significant increase on all the yield parameter assessed
    in both years of cropping. All the soybeans that were inoculated with rhizobium
    produced the highest number of flowers 58.45 and 56.84 highest number of pods
    per plant 48.15 and 35.34 and highest seed weight of 2.67 and 2.85 t ha .1 Application
    of 10 t ha 1 of biocharproduced the highest number of flowers 63.26 and 68.21
    highest number of pods per plant 53.45 and 54.25 and highest seed weight of 2.53
    and 2.69 t ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons respectively. Ndor, E | Jayeoba
