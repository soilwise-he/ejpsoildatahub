  title: Assessment of the Mechanical Properties of Subgrade Stabilized with Cement
    Kiln Dust and Coconut Coir on Silty Clayey Soil
  abstract: Abstract Soft soils are undesirable soils that are not suitable for road
    construction due to their low shear strength and high compressibility level. Remediation
    is very essential to avoid potential pavement failure due to traffic and climatic
    condition because strength and volume stability are important properties in subgrade
    construction. This research investigates the assessment of the mechanical properties
    of subgrade stabilized with CKD and CF on silty clayey soil. Samples collected
    from No7 Ekpenyong Abasi Street, Off Palace Road Anatigha, Calabar South, Cross
    River. Cement kiln dust and coir fiber have been used as a stabilizing agent in
    this work and their effect on the physical and geotechnical properties of the
    soft soil have been measured using the Grain Size Distribution Test, Consistency
    Limit Test, Specific Gravity Test, Compaction Parameters ((OMC) and (MDD), California
    Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS). The tests were
    performed using replacement method which content combination of soil of varying
    percentages of (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50% and 40%) and varying percentages
    of CKD of (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60%) and a fixed CF of (0.5%). The
    dried soil (3000g) by dry weight with the required water content were mixed and
    then different dosages of CKD was added to the soil, soil was replaced with CKD
    at a constant dosage of CF was added at each mixed. The dried soil of (3000g)
    by dry weight with required water content was also mixed without admixture to
    compare the CBR test results. After the compaction the samples treated with CKD
    and CF were tested for soaked and unsoaked CBR. The UCS samples were cured for
    0 days, 7 days and 14 days. The test results indicated that the MDD progresses
    from 0% CKD, 0% CF and 0% Soil material to 50% CKD, 50% soil at a fixed CF of
    0.5% before dropping showing that the maximum workability at its peak for both
    materials by percentage replacement is 50% each for CKD and soil material at a
    fixed CF of 0.5%, thus the soaked and unsoaked CBR and UCS also showed the same
    characteristics properties.
