    Abstract: The Caspian forests of Iran were monitored and evaluated for forest
    natural regeneration&lt;br&gt;

    after logging activities for more than a decade. This large area has a substantial
    ecological,&lt;br&gt;

    environmental and socio-economic importance. Ground based skidding is the most
    common&lt;br&gt;

    logging method in these forests and soil compaction is the most critical consequence
    of this method.&lt;br&gt;

    One of the current main topics and important emerging issue in forest research
    of the last decade are&lt;br&gt;

    discussed in this study. Soil compaction has major influences on growth and/or
    mortality rates of&lt;br&gt;

    forest seedlings. This study has lasted for over ten years so as to have a clear
    overview related to forest&lt;br&gt;

    natural regeneration after logging activities. We monitored and evaluated physical
    soil properties&lt;br&gt;

    (bulk density, penetration resistance and total porosity) and their eects on maple
    and beech seedlings&lt;br&gt;

    on 10-year-old skid trails in the Iranian Caspian forests. Results obtained from
    evaluating the impact&lt;br&gt;

    of skid trails within the aforementioned three soil physical parameters were significant;
    bulk density&lt;br&gt;

    increased by 12.6% on log skidded routes (between two skidder tires on skid trail)
    and 36.1% on&lt;br&gt;

    tire tracks, compared to non-skid trails (1.19 g/cm3), penetration resistance
    increased by 68% on&lt;br&gt;

    log skidded routes and 220% on tire tracks, compared to non-skid trails (0.25
    MPa), total porosity&lt;br&gt;

    decreased by 12.8% on log skidded routes and 30.9% on tire tracks, compared to
    non-skid trails (54%).&lt;br&gt;

    Among the morphological parameters, lateral root length (LRL) and root penetration
    depth (RPD)&lt;br&gt;

    showed the highest decrease at soil compaction compared to the control (decrease
    in LRL: 60% in&lt;br&gt;

    maple and 44% in beech; decrease in RPD: 56% in both maple and beech); the main
    response of&lt;br&gt;

    growth parameters to soil compaction was found in roots (decrease in dry mass
    of 36% both in maple&lt;br&gt;

    and beech); architectural parameters were also influenced by soil compaction,
    and the response of&lt;br&gt;

    both seedling species was more evident in the ratio of main root to stem length
    (RRS) (reduction in&lt;br&gt;

    RRS 42% in maple, 33% in beech); the ratio of RPD to main root length (RPL) also
    showed a great&lt;br&gt;

    reduction (reduction in RPL 20% in maple 33% in beech). Physical soil properties,
    changes in other&lt;br&gt;

    environmental properties of skid trails, created dierences in beech and maple
    seedling growth&lt;br&gt;

    between the skid trails and non-skid trails. This was closely related to the physiological
    characteristics&lt;br&gt;

    of the two species studied. Beech seedlings reacted well to a moderate uncovering
    but they needed&lt;br&gt;

    little disturbed soil, even if there was a very mixed bedding. Maple seedlings
    reacted better than&lt;br&gt;

    beech seedlings to the uncovering and soil disturbance. The eects of the skid
    trail on morphology,&lt;br&gt;

    growth and architecture of maple seedlings in the Hyrcanian beech forests showed
    that the maple,&lt;br&gt;

    as a seedling, is a suitable species for maintaining the physical properties of
    skid trails after logging&lt;br&gt;

    operations in the beech stands in the Caspian forests of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
