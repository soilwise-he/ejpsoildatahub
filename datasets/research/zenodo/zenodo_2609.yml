  title: 'Estimation of Soil Moisture Content in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo-State
    using Remote Sensing Technique: 2018 Study'
  abstract: <em>Accurate estimation of soil moisture is crucial for effective water
    and soil resource management. Surface soil moisture, a key variable in the natural
    water cycle, significantly influences hydrological, ecological, and meteorological
    processes, thereby impacting global water and energy equilibrium. Understanding
    the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture is essential due to its direct
    influence on vegetation distribution. Insufficient moisture leads to yield loss
    and plant mortality, while excessive moisture can cause root diseases and water
    wastage. Soil moisture measurements can be conducted through in situ methods or
    indirectly through transfer functions or remote sensing. However, in situ measurements
    are often too expensive and time-consuming for large areas, making remote sensing
    an attractive alternative for soil moisture estimation on larger scales. This
    study aims to estimate soil moisture using land surface temperature as a proxy.
    To achieve this, ground temperature was derived from Landsat-8 thermal infrared
    band for the Oredo Local Government Area. ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.2.2) was employed
    to estimate soil moisture based on the calculated ground temperature. The study
    identified areas with low, moderate, and high moisture contents, with the moderate
    moisture index being predominant during both seasons. These findings establish
    a valuable database that can support farmers in implementing precision farming
    practices within the investigated local government area</em>
