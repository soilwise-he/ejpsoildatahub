  title: MICROBIAL REMEDIATION OF HEAVY METALS CONTAMINATION IN SOIL
  abstract: Abstract Heavy metals are metals with density above 5g/cm3 which occur<br>
    naturally in the environment. However, the indiscriminate discharge arising from<br>
    geochemical and anthropogenic activities have remained a galloping source of contamination<br>
    in the ecosystem. They can be mitigated through the use of microorganisms such
    as<br> Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Aspergillus species. The mechanisms utilized
    by microbes in<br> heavy metals remediation include change in biochemical pathways
    that obstruct metal uptake,<br> enzymatic transformation of metals to harmless
    forms and the use of exact effluent system for<br> reducing intracellular concentration
    of metals. Factors such as physicochemical and<br> biological are known to influence
    heavy metal remediation in contaminated sites. Prolonged<br> exposure of such
    heavy metals could have deleterious health effects on human life including<br>
    inhibition of libido in male reproductive systems and obstruction of ovulation
    in females as<br> well as in other terrestrial and aquatic biota. The use of microorganisms
    in cleaning up heavy<br> metals contaminated sites is a viable and sustainable
    one as it overcomes the drawbacks<br> encountered in other methods of heavy metal
    treatments. This leads to a healthy environment<br> and guarantees public health
    of it teeming citizens.
