  title: Impact of Land Use Change and Afforestation on Soil Properties in a Mediterranean
    Mountain Area of Central Spain
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Afforestation can improve hydrological processes,
    such as infiltration, in basins and, therefore, reduce the impact on human populations
    of floods, soil erosion, landslides, droughts, and cl imate variation. The aim
    of this work was to analyze how afforestation and other changes in landuse influence
    infiltrability and the evolution of soils. Infiltration rates, soil water repellency,
    and physical and chemical properties of sandy loam soils were measured in four
    types of land: native holm oak forest, afforested 20-year-old pine forest, shrubs,
    and grasslands. Non-forest covers are the result of the degradation of native
    oak forests for centuries, while the pine afforestation in this study took place
    on a perennial wet mountain pasture (cervunalito). Our results show that soil
    infiltration rates are much higher in pine afforestation areas (857.67 mmh-1)
    than in holm oak forest (660.67 mmh-1), grasslands (280.00 mmh-1), or shrubs (271.67
    mmh-1). No statistically significant differences in fertility, organic matter
    content, bulk density, or effective porosity were found between afforestation
    areas and other types of cover; however, pine afforestation improved the drainage
    of the soil, as its infiltration rate was higher than that of the native holm
    oak forest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
