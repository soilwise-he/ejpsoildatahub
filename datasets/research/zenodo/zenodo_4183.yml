  title: USING ADOBE (CLAY SOIL) MIXED WITH QUARTZ (SHARP SAND) TO DETERMINE THE THERMAL
    COMFORT OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN NORTH-MUBI L. G, ADAMAWA STATE, NIGERIA
  abstract: The adobe structure is constructed by using low energy materials like
    adobe soil and sand etc. Adobe and cob are terms often used to describe sun dried
    clay materials. Adobe is a Spanish word derived from the Arabic atob, which literally
    means sun dried bricks.This paper investigated the thermal conductivity of Adobe
    mixed with Quartz in view of their availability usage as building materials. The
    thermal conductivities of disc made from Adobe-Quartz chippings were determined,
    the values obtained were between 0.57Wm-1k-1 and 0.91Wm-1k-1, and these values
    could be used to identify Adobe-Quartz as one of the engineering materials used
    in building construction, adopted to reduce the temperature of buildings without
    the need for power consumption. Consequently, the aim of this study is to test
    the usefulness of applying selected Adobe-Quartz to improve thermal performance
    and to reduce energy consumption of residential buildings in hot arid climate
    setting, Mubi, Adamawa State, Nigeria. Energy reduction was achieved by making
    the Adobe-Quartz into bricks used as aggregates in walls. Adobe-Quartz was made
    in disc form of the same thickness and diameter, by proportions of Adobe to Quartz
    (90:10, 85:15, 80:20), i.e. 10 samples for each ratio. The average values of the
    thermal conductivities were between 0.07Wm-1k-1 and 0.93Wm-1k-1, the least thermal
    conductivity value was 0.57Wm-1k- 1 for the ratio of (90:10). MATLAB 7.0 and EXCEL
    software were used in the various computations. An average correlation coefficient,
    R2 of 0.75 was existed between Adobe-Quartz ratios to thermal conductivities.
