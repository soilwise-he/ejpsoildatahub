  title: Floral Diversity and Soil Property Changes as Affected by Rehabilitation
    in Volcanic ash-Laden Areas in Cabangan, Zambales
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> Comparative Assessment conducted between the
    floral diversity and soil properties of rehabilitated volcanic ash-laden areas
    in Cabangan, Zambale sand grassland area in Barangay Cadmang, Cabangan, Zambales.
    Quadrant sampling method was used in vegetation sampling for trees and understorey
    while line intercept method was used in vegetation sampling for ground cover.
    Diversity was determined using Shannon-Weinner Diversity index. Dominant species
    were also determined by computing the importance value of each species. Composite
    soil samplings were collected from the area and its physical and chemical properties
    were analyzed at the ERDB Soils Laboratory. Thirteen years after the establishment
    of species screening trials in the Pinatubo volcanic-ach laden areas in Cabangan,
    Zambales results showed that the species planted accelerates the rate of ecological
    succession in the once-degraded area. Ecological transformation is evident in
    the rehabilitated area compared with grassland areas with no rehabilitation measures
    undertaken. Among the twelve species planted, nitrogen-fixing trees such as Agoho
    (Casuarina equisetifolia); Narra (Pterocarpus indicus); Mangium (Acacia mangium);
    Rain tree (Samanea saman); Auri (Acacia auriculiformis) survived very well in
    the area while Gmelina (Gmelina arborea) and Dapdap (Erythrina orientalis) also
    survived but at a lower survival rate. Bagras (Eucalyptus deglupta), Mahogany
    (Swietenia macrophylla), Salago (Wilkstroemia speciosa), Bayog (Dendrocalamus
    merillianus) and Kauatan-tinik (Bambusa spinosa) failed to survive in the harsh
    volcanic-ash laden area. In rehabilitated volcanic-ash laden areas, floral diversity
    is higher diversity compared with natural grasslands where there are no rehabilitation
    measures done. The rehabilitated area has a species richness of 59 compared to
    grassland with only 8. The diversity index of trees, understorey and ground cover
    species in the rehabilitated area revealed that it is higher compared to the grassland
    adjacent to it. Soil analysis revealed changes in the soil chemical properties
    of the rehabilitated areas in Barangay Cadmang, Cabangan, Zambales. Nitrogen and
    Potassium content of the soil decreased from very high to very low N and very
    high to low K. The nitrogen and potassium in the soil might have been absorbed
    by the plants and now locked up in the biomass resulting in the decrease of the
    nutrients. For Phosphorus, there is a significant increase from very low to very
    high possibly due to mineralization. No significant changes on the pH, Calcium
    and Magnesium content of the soil were observed.
