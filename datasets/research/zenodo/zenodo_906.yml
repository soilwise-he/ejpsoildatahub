  title: THE PROCESS OF SOIL SOLONTSIS UNDER THE INFLUENCE MINERALIZED WATERS
  abstract: <em>In the soils studied by us, changes in the composition of the soil
    absorption complex (SAC) occur mainly between three cations, such as Ca<sup>++</sup>,
    Mg<sup>++</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, the radii of which differ from each other within
    20%. According to A.E., Fersman [11], when the ion radii differ by up to 20%,
    cations are considered interchangeable, in other words, isomorphic in the crystal
    lattices of minerals, which is why when irrigating with mineralized water, sodium
    ions replace Mg++ and Ca++ ions. This substitution occurs gradually and over a
    long period the influence of mineralized waters and at a certain stage quantitatively
    stabilizes. In order to predict the probability of the sodium cation entering
    the SAC, and therefore the potential danger of soil alkalinization during irrigation
    with mineralized waters, a special indicator SAR (Sodium adsorption ratio) is
    used, which, based on Ca ++, Mg++, Na</em><em>+</em><em> data, makes it possible
    to assess the quality of irrigation water. Our waters, both river and mineralized,
    had a low risk of salinization and alkalinization according to this indicator,
    and therefore, when they were used as irrigation water, they did not render the
    soil unusable for a short period of 3-10 years, i.e. in terms of solonetzization,
    there were no significant changes, the soils were not solonetzic and remained
    so. But the process of solonetzization took place.</em>
