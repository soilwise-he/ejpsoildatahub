  title: Effect of duration of cultivation of Syringa vulgaris L. cultivars on microbiota
    and allelopathic state of soil
  abstract: Microbiological and allelopathic properties of soil under <em>Syringa
    vulgaris</em> L. cultivars at different duration of cultivation were studied.
    It was shown that plants age influenced microbiota dynamics less than cultivar
    and phenological phases. It was established that phytotoxicity of soil depended
    on phenolics content in it and increased at enlargement of duration of lilac cultivation.
