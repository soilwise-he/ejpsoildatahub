  title: Evaluation of Natural Radoiactivity of Soil Samples in Some Selected Areas
    of Adamawa State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Evaluation of naturally, occurring radionuclides,238U,232Th and40K. in\
    \ the five locations of Adamawa state were carried out using gamma-ray spectrometry\
    \ with well-type NaI detector to determine the natural radionuclides in the living\
    \ environment and farmland soil samples to evaluate the hazards they might pose\
    \ on the public. The calculated average activity concentrationsare 17.60 BqKg-1,\
    \ 5.16 BqKg-1 and 847.24 BqKg-1 respectively. The mean activity concentration\
    \ of the radionuclides 238U, and 232Th in the present study are much lower than\
    \ the worldwide average permissible values of 33 BqKg-1 and 45 BqKg-1 respectively.\
    \ That of 40K is higher than the world average value of 420 BqKg-1. For those\
    \ of the farmland soil samples, the average activity concentrations of the radionuclides:\
    \ 238U, 232Th and 40K were 17.95 BqKg-1, 5.61BqKg-1 and 891.34 BqKg-1 respectively.\
    \ It was also seenthat, the average activity concentration of 238U and 232Th are\
    \ much lower, compared to the world allowed average of 33 BqKg-1 and 45 BqKg-1.\
    \ In addition, that of 40K is much higher than the world average of 420 BqKg-1.\
    \ The study also revealed that the calculated of Raeq, absorbed dose rate and\
    \ annual effective dose rate of the living environment, soil samples were found\
    \ to be 90.20 BqKg-1, 47.36 nGyh-1 and 0.29mSvy-1 respectively. Those of the farmland\
    \ soil samples were also found to be 92.41 BqKg-1, 49.69 nGyh-1 and 0.3 mSvy-1\
    \ respectively. The mean values of all the parameters are within the world average\
    \ recommended safety limits. The internal commission on Radiological Protection\
    \ (ICRP) has recommended the annual effective \_\_dose equivalent limit of 1mSvy-1\
    \ for the individual members of the public and 20mSvy-1 for the radiation workers.Therefore,\
    \ it can be concluded that the present study areas are safe from radiation hazards\
    \ with no harmful effects posed to the living population in the environments."
