    \ concentration levels of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K\
    \ in soil have a great concern in the recent decades, due to its effect on the\
    \ human health. The radioactivity of some soil samples taken from selected locations\
    \ in Sylhet District have been measured using a High Purity Germanium Detector\
    \ based on gamma ray spectroscopy. The present investigation shows that the level\
    \ of natural radioactivity for <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K\
    \ in such soil is slightly higher than World average value of UNSCEAR,2000. The\
    \ artificial radionuclide <sup>137</sup>Cs was not observed in statistically significant\
    \ amounts above background level in this study. The radiological hazard parameters\
    \ i.e., radium equivalent activity, absorbed dose rate, external hazard index,\
    \ internal hazard index, representative level index and annual effective dose\
    \ equivalent are calculated from the measured activity concentrations of the radionuclides\
    \ <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K from soil samples in this\
    \ study and compared with the world averages. The experimental soil data were\
    \ subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS software (version 20). Descriptive\
    \ statistics of the radionuclides of the soil, Pearson\u2019s correlation matrix\
    \ and Cluster Analysis have been carried out in this study. <strong>Key words:</strong>\
    \ Soil, Gamma ray spectroscopy, Activity Concentration, Radiological hazard parameters,\
    \ statistical analysis. https://www.ijlst.org/papers-published/ijlst-2022-volume-14-issue-2"
