  title: AN INDEX FOR MEASURING KNOWLEDGE AND ADOPTION BEHAVIOR OF SOIL HEALTH CARD
    RECOMMENDATIONS IN MANDYA DISTRICT OF KARNATAKA
  abstract: "The present study was carried out during 2018-19 to analyse the knowledge\
    \ level of soil Health Card (SHC) beneficiaries and their adoption behavior on\
    \ recommendations done in Soil Health Card. Out of 120 soil health card beneficiaries\
    \ 60 were selected from each taluk by taking six villages in Mandya and Maddur\
    \ taluks of Mandya district. Ten SHC beneficiaries from each village were randomly\
    \ selected for the study. Data was collected using a pre-tested interview schedule.\
    \ A perusal of this table revealed that about 53 percent belongs to middle age\
    \ (35 to 50 years) however , one third of the respondents (33.33 per cent) belongs\
    \ to old age category and 22.50 per cent were belongs to young age. Most of the\
    \ respondents were educated from primary school level to post graduation level\
    \ (Percentage varies). More than one third of the respondents (43.33 %, 41.66%\
    \ and 40.83 %) were having high cosmopoliteness and medium mass media exposure\
    \ and high Extension agency contact respectively. More than one third of the SHC\
    \ beneficiaries were having medium extension participation (40.00%), medium achievement\
    \ motivation (42.50%), medium scientific orientation (40.83%) and followed by\
    \ high and low groups. Almost 96.66 per cent of the SHC beneficiaries have knowledge\
    \ on the major nutrients covered in SHC\u2019 and 87.50 per cent of the SHC beneficiaries\
    \ have knowledge on the place from where soil samples should be collected. Majority\
    \ of the Soil Health Card beneficiaries (95 %) adopted application of major nutrients\
    \ like nitrogen, phosphorus and potash as recommended in soil health cards. one\
    \ fourth of soil health card beneficiaries (28.33%) were applying micro nutrients\
    \ as recommended in SHCs. This may be due to lack of knowledge on the importance\
    \ of micro nutrients to the crops. More than three forth of the soil Health Card\
    \ beneficiaries are adopted ideal depth while collecting soil sample. More than\
    \ half of the SHC beneficiaries are aware of ideal time of soil sampling and followed\
    \ it. This may be due to high and medium level of cosmopoliteness, Extension participation\
    \ and mass media exposure. Before distributing soil health cards, a series of\
    \ interactions and technical training programmes organized by agriculture department\
    \ and other stakeholders helps to achieve better adoption of soil health management\
    \ aspects."
