  title: A comparative study of time of application between humic acid and organic
    matter on N transformation in soil
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur, Nadia-741 252, West Bengal, India <em>E-mail</em>\
    \ : ashimdatta2007@gmail.com <em>Manuscript received 27 December 2012, revised\
    \ 22 August 2013, accepted 12 September 2013</em> A laboratory investigation was\
    \ carried out to monitor changes in different forms of N in soil treated with\
    \ humic acid or organic matter 21 days before or on the day of start of the experiment.\
    \ Results reveal that irrespective of treatments and stages of incubation, comparatively\
    \ higher amount of exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and soluble NO<sub>3</sub><strong><sup>\u2013\
    </sup></strong> is accumulated in soil treated either with FYM (Farm Yard Manure)\
    \ or humic acid 21 days before than on the day of start of the experiment. Humic\
    \ acid is decomposed faster than FYM leading to higher amount of accumulation\
    \ of available N in humic acid treated system. Again, in general, irrespective\
    \ of treatments, hydrolysable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increased over 120 days\
    \ period of incubation and the amount of increase is more in soil treated either\
    \ with FYM or humic acid on the day of start of the experiment. Amino acid and\
    \ total hydrolysable organic N are more prone to N-mineralisation."
