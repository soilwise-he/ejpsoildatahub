  title: Investigate the Impact of Large Ungulates on Forest Land with Regard to Soil
    Hydrology in Central and Eastern Europe
  abstract: "The study of impact of large ungulates on forest land with regard to\
    \ soil hydrology was conducted in two locations in central and eastern Europe.\
    \ The study aimed to investigate the impact of large ungulates on forest soils,\
    \ as produced by trampling or hoof action, with respect to soil hydrology. Samples\
    \ for determination of water retention were taken from three kinds of plots representing\
    \ different sites with different degrees of animal disturbnace (high disturbance,\
    \ intermediate, and undisturbed conditions). From each plot, several soil samples\
    \ were taken from two depths (0\u20135 cm and 5\u201310 cm). Water infiltration\
    \ measurements were conducted for determining soil hydraulic conductivity. The\
    \ data used for evaluating soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity\
    \ were analyzed through the ANOVAwith Duncan\u2019s multiple range test and Wilcoxon\
    \ matched pair test at P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.1, respectively. The mean hydraulic\
    \ conductivity (2, 77.10-2 cm day-1) in the high disturbed area was significantly\
    \ lower than (3,88.10-2 cm day-1) in the undisturbed area. Water retention significantly\
    \ lower in the disturbed sites than undisturbed, except in the plot Topo\u013E\
    \u010Dianky Bison Park, it is higher in the disturbed site."
