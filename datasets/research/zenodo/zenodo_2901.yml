  title: EFFECT OF PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS APPLIED AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND METHODS ON
    GROWTH OF WINTER WHEAT UNDER IRRIGATED TYPICAL GRAY SOIL CONDITIONS
  abstract: Currently, phosphorus fertilizers are used in winter wheat in all farms
    of the Republic in unscientifically unfounded norms and terms. Because no scientific
    research has been conducted in this regard. In addition, it is observed that phosphorus
    fertilizers are applied to winter wheat planted between rows of cotton, after
    planting, and in other periods, depending on the farmer's ability. It is known
    that each of the mineral nutrients used during the growth and development of plants
    has its own role. It is also important to apply phosphorus fertilizers in the
    appropriate rates and periods in winter wheat.
