  title: Genetic potential of Novi Sad winter wheat varieties on smonica-type soil
  abstract: "The field experiment with the wheat varieties Simonida, NS 40 S, Zvezdana,\n\
    NS Ilina, NS Futura, NS Mila and NS Obala was set up on the smonica-type\nsoil\
    \ during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 growing seasons. The aim of the research\nwas\
    \ to analyse the yield, weight of 1000 grains and hectolitre weight of seven\n\
    Novi Sad wheat varieties grown on slightly acidic soil. The highest values\nof\
    \ the observed properties were established in the 2017/18 vegetation year\nwith\
    \ moderate temperatures and a higher amount of precipitation. Varieties\nNS Futura,\
    \ NS Obala and NS 40 S had the highest grain yield during the\ntwo-year study.\
    \ The Simonida variety was characterized by the highest\nhectolitre weight. The\
    \ highest values of hectolitre weight were found in the\nZvezdana variety in both\
    \ study years. The analysis of variance established a\nhighly significant influence\
    \ of the interaction of agro climatic conditions and\ngenotype on the weight of\
    \ 1000 grains and the hectolitre weight of the tested\nvarieties of winter wheat.\n\
