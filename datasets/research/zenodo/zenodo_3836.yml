  title: Nitrogen Requirements of Amaranthus cruentus L. on Two Soil Types in Lagos
    State of Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soils from Ikorodu (Orthic Luvisol) and Lagos State University
    (LASU) Ojo campus (Dystric Fluvisol) were used in greenhouse experiments to determine
    N, requirement of Amaranthus cruentus L. using five rates of NPK 15:15:15 at 0,
    150, 300, 450 and 600 kg ha1. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized
    design with four replications. Soil treated with 300 and 450 kg ha-1 NPK 15:15:15
    significantly (p&lt;0.05) enhanced plant height, number of leaves, shoot fresh
    and dry weight and plant N-uptake compared to other treatments at Ikorodu. Corresponding
    values were obtained from soil treated with 450 and 600 kg ha-I NPK 15:15:15 at
    LASU. Optimum N, requirements for A. cruentus at Ikorodu and LASU were 45.0 and
    67.5 kg N/ha-1 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;'
