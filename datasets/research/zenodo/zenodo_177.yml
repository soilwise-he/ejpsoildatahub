  title: Evaluation of soil structure under the influence of pedoclimatic conditions
    and soil tillage systems
  abstract: Soil is the one of the basic elements of the environment. The agroecosystems
    created by humans exert a negative influence on its physical properties as the
    structure is an inherent characteristic on which the fertility of soils depends.
    Correct maintenance of soil used under agricultural land can reduce this problem.
    The structure of the soil carried out by wet and dry sieving by the sieve method
    shows us that in the agrocenoses with winter wheat (No-till) the best structure
    was highlighted at a depth of 0-30 cm. The quality of the structure also depends
    on some physical properties of the soil, as well as the cultivated plant. To improve
    the structure and quality of the soil, you can use coarse organic material, which
    should make (dig) in the soil or just spread on the surface 10 cm layer as a mulch
    at least twice a year.
