  title: The Impact of Pulverized Cow Bone on the Atterberg Limits of Lateritic Soil
    from Uwheru Town, Delta State, Nigeria
  abstract: <em>This study investigated the effect of pulverized cow bone (PCB) on
    the Atterberg limits of lateritic soil samples in Southern Nigeria. The liquid
    limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and plasticity index (PI) of natural soil and
    soil mixed with different proportions of PCB were determined in the laboratory.
    The results showed that the liquid limit of the soil decreased with increasing
    PCB content, while the plastic limit increased, except for the sample mixed with
    6% PCB, which had a lower plastic limit than the sample mixed with 4% PCB. The
    plasticity index of the soil also reduced with increasing PCB content. All the
    soil samples, both natural and stabilized, met the recommended maximum liquid
    limit for sub-base and base materials. The findings suggest that the addition
    of PCB may improve the soil's shear strength and reduce its susceptibility to
    plastic deformation. These results can be useful in the design and construction
    of roads and other civil engineering structures using lateritic soils in Southern
    Nigeria.</em>
