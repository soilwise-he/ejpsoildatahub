  title: Prevalence and Correlates of Soil Transmitted Helminthic Parasitic Infections
    among Patients in A Tertiary Care Centre in Dibrugarh, Assam
  abstract: '<strong>Background: </strong>Helminthic infections are a major public
    health issue in developing countries, affecting millions of people worldwide.
    Previous studies have reported high prevalence rates of helminth infections, particularly
    in children and vulnerable populations.Helminth infections continue to pose a
    significant public health challenge in developing countries, particularly among
    children and vulnerable populations. <strong>Materials and methods: </strong>This
    cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of helminth
    infections in a population of 2200 individuals and investigate possible associations
    with gender, age inpatient and outpatient. <strong>Results: </strong>We found
    a helminth prevalence of 3.86%, with Ascaris <em>lumbricoides</em> being the most
    common parasite identified, followed by Ankylostoma <em>duodenale</em>, Trichuris
    <em>trichuria</em>, Strongyl oides <em>stercoralis</em>, and Enterobius <em>vermicularis</em>.
    Mixed infections were observed in 10.9% of the cases, with Ankylostoma <em>duodenale</em>
    and Strongy loides <em>stercoralis</em> being the most common combination. Males
    constituted 62.35% of the infected cases, and inpatient cases constituted 85.85%
    of the infected cases. The highest number of cases was found in the age group
    of 10-14 years. Our study highlights the significant burden of helminth infections
    in the population and underscores the need for effective prevention and control
    strategies. <strong>Conclusion: </strong>Our study highlights the significant
    burden of helminth infections in the population, particularly in developing countries.
    Effective prevention and control strategies, tailored to specific risk factors,
    are urgently needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these
    infections.'
