  title: Soil failure can be used for seismic protection of structures
  abstract: "A new seismic design philosophy is illuminated, taking advantage of soil\
    \ \u201Cfailure\u201D to protect the superstructure. Instead of over-designing\
    \ the foundation to ensure that the loading stemming from the structural inertia\
    \ can be \u201Csafely\u201D transmitted onto the soil (as with conventional capacity\
    \ design), and then reinforce the superstructure to avoid collapse, why not do\
    \ exactly the opposite by intentionally under-designing the foundation to act\
    \ as a \u201Csafety valve\u201D ? The need for this \u201Creversal\u201D stems\
    \ from the uncertainty in predicting the actual earthquake motion, and the necessity\
    \ of developing new more rational and economically efficient earthquake protection\
    \ solutions. A simple but realistic bridge structure is used as an example to\
    \ illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach. Two alternatives are compared\
    \ : one complying with conventional capacity design, with over-designed foundation\
    \ so that plastic \u201Chinging\u201D develops in the superstructure ; the other\
    \ following the new design philosophy, with under-designed foundation, \u201C\
    inviting\u201D the plastic \u201Chinge\u201D into the soil. Static \u201Cpushover\u201D\
    \ analyses reveal that the ductility capacity of the new design concept is an\
    \ order of magnitude larger than of the conventional design : the advantage of\
    \ \u201Cutilising\u201D progressive soil failure. The seismic performance of the\
    \ two alternatives is investigated through nonlinear dynamic time history analyses,\
    \ using an ensemble of 29 real accelerograms. It is shown that the performance\
    \ of both alternatives is totally acceptable for moderate intensity earthquakes,\
    \ not exceeding the design limits. For large intensity earthquakes, exceeding\
    \ the design limits, the performance of the new design scheme is proven advantageous,\
    \ not only avoiding collapse but hardly suffering any inelastic structural deformation.\
    \ It may however experience increased residual settlement and rotation : a price\
    \ to pay that must be properly assessed in design."
