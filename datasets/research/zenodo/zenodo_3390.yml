  title: Evaluation Of Soil For Agricultural Purpose In Veppanthattai Block
  abstract: Now a days population is growing dramatically so the farming community
    has been forced to cultivate more and more with restricted area. At the mean time
    they have been pushed to produce more and higher quality food using eco friendly
    practices. The aim of this project to determine the suitable soil for agricultural
    purpose in Veppanthattai block, Perambalur district. For this purpose we have
    taken 29 places near to Veppanthattai and also conduct test to determine the characteristic
    of soil like pH, EC, N, P, and K. Soil suitability analysis is a prerequisite
    for sustainable agricultural production. It involves evaluation of the criteria
    ranging from soil, terrain to socio-economic market and infra-structure. Many
    of these factors are vaguely defined and characterized by their inherent vagueness.
    Many parameters like pH, fertility etc. which very continuously over the space
    and it is not possible to model as it is. This suitability is a function of crop
    requirements and soil characteristic matching the land characteristics with the
    crop requirement gives the suitability so suitability is a measure of how well
    the qualities of a land unit match the requirements of particular form of land
    use. Besides the soil characteristic socio-economic infra-structure characteristics
    are the other driving forces that can influence the crop selection.
