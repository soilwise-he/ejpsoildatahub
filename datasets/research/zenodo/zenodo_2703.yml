  title: Determination Of The Best Canopy Gap Area On The Basis Of Soil Characteristics
    Using The Analytical Hierarchy Process (Ahp)
  abstract: "The assessment of canopy gap areas on the basis of soil characteristics\
    \ in forest ecosystems could be one of benefit points for management of forests.\
    \ This research was conducted in 20 ha areas of Experimental Forest Station of\
    \ Tarbiat Modares University that is located in a temperate forest of Mazandaran\
    \ province in the north of Iran. Twenty one canopy gaps with different areas were\
    \ found in studied areas and classified as small (85.12 m2), medium (325.21 m2),\
    \ large (512.11 m2) and very large (723.85 m2) gaps. These areas classes of canopy\
    \ gaps were assessed with respect to nine criteria (soil pH, carbon to nitrogen\
    \ ratio, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, nitrogen mineralization,\
    \ microbial respiration and earthworm\u2019s biomass). Soil samples (0\u2013 45\
    \ cm depth from the gap center and edge positions) were measured in the laboratory.\
    \ The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for assessment of canopy gap\
    \ areas. This method is widely used the Multiple Criteria Decision Support (MCDS)\
    \ method and perhaps the most popular in many fields, including natural resource\
    \ management, especially in forest sciences. Results of AHP indicate that the\
    \ maximum of local priority belongs to small areas of canopy gaps when considering\
    \ all soil characteristics. However, medium, large and very large canopy gap areas\
    \ have priorities, respectively. The calculated overall priority showed that with\
    \ respect to considered criterias, small and medium gap areas have higher, more\
    \ ideal condition in comparison to large and very large areas. AHP results emphasise\
    \ that considering soil characteristics canopy gap areas should be less than 400\
    \ m2 in Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Also, AHP can be introduced as an effective\
    \ instrument in decision-making processes for investment planning and prioritization\
    \ in compliance with environmental regulations."
