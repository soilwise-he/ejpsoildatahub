  title: Handbook of plant and soil analysis for agricultural systems
  abstract: 'This books compiles different protocols for analysis of plant and soil
    for agricultural systems. We aim to provide a complete set of indicators to assess
    crop productivity, crop quality, soil quality and soil fertility with feasible
    and robust procedures and methods. The assessment of the sustainability of agroecosystems
    needs the selection of suitable indicators and their measure. The present handbook
    has compiled different indicators to assess crop growth, incidence of pests and
    diseases, farm yield, crop quality and nutritional characteristics, soil physical
    analyses, soil chemical analyses and soil biological analyses. The book is organized
    in three parts: i) plant and crop analyses, ii) soil physicochemical analyses
    and iii) soil biological analyses. In total we provide 90 procedures for plant
    and soil analysis, including the importance and applications, the principle of
    the method described, the reagents needed, the materials and equipment, the detailed
    description of the procedure, the calculations required and some specific remarks.'
