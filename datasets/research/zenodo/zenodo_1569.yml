    the ecological state of the soil and the problem of developing energy-efficient,
    inexpensive, biologically and environmentally clean production technologies for
    crop production. The use of valuable chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order
    to obtain high yields from crops increases the pollution of the environment, ie
    soil, air and groundwater, the products contain nitrates, herbicides, fungicides,
