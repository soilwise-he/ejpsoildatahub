  title: "Zinc in soil around non-ferrous metals smelter \"Miasteczko \u015Al\u0105\
    skie\""
  abstract: "The zinc and lead smelter \"Miasteczko \u015Al\u0105skie\" near Tarnowskie\
    \ G\xF3ry started in 1968. In the last few years emissions of contaminants from\
    \ the production process of Zn and Pb were reduced. But some of the elements remain\
    \ accumulated in the upper layer of the soil. Samples of the upper layer (0 -\
    \ 5 cm) of the soil were taken along transects set with a compass in the following\
    \ directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW, starting from the smelter in the\
    \ distances of: 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 m, and then every 250 m, up to\
    \ 3000 m. The concentration of zinc was measured by conventional AAS method. The\
    \ highest content of zinc in soil was found 50 - 100 m from the smelter. It was\
    \ probably due to the grain-size composition of dust emitted by the smelter and\
    \ to local content of heavy metals in the soil."
