  title: Development of a Low-Cost Soil Heat Flux and Temperature Profile with Logger
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation of soil temperature and soil heat flux measurements
    from a locally fabricated and calibrated device were analyzed and compared with
    a standard device. The soil heat flux consists of two-disc aluminum plates, dielectric
    material and two thermocouples such that each thermocouple was sandwiched between
    the aluminum plates and one side of the dielectric material. The sizes of the
    aluminum plates and the dielectric material were 32 mm in diameter and their thickness
    is 2.5 mm. Differential temperature between two thermocouples attached to two
    aluminum plates separated by a thermal insulator was used to measure the soil
    heat flux values. The thermocouples amplifier module AD8495 and then combined
    with a 16-bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADS1115) for a good measurement resolution
    was employed for the signal conditioning. A semiconductor sensor DS18B20 was used
    to measure the soil temperature. The microSD shield was included for storing data
    and DS3232, a Real Time Clock (RTC) module for timekeeping. Arduino mega 2560
    microcontroller was used to coordinate the whole active and display the activities
    on LCD. The soil heat flux sensor was calibrated using the principle of thermal
    conduction over the surface area by heating with a known heat source. The thermal
    conductivity of heat flux is given by 3.3407 (WV-1m-1) from the empirical deduction.
    The temperature sensing unit was checked for accuracy by inserting it inside a
    calorimeter with the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the correlation obtained
    was 0.92. The soil heat flux and temperature sensing unit were compared with that
    of standard Campbell device. The correlation obtained for soil heat flux and temperature
    were 0.89 and 0.95 respectively. The result obtained when installed at the Redeemer&rsquo;s
    University, Ede, Nigeria, the variation of soil heat flux and temperature when
    placed at the same level of 10 cm into the soil gave the same value. The maximum
    peak of heat flux density usually occurs at about 13:00 pm to 15:00 pm with values
    around 260 W/m2 at 10 cm. The logging interval can be preset to any rate from
    30 seconds and above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
