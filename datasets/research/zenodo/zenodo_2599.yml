  title: Morphological Impacts Of Pollutants From Detergents On Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa
    L.) Grown In Water Cultured And Soil Media
  abstract: Greywater released into the environment impacts aquatic organisms and
    the entire ecosystem due to their intricate network of interdependence and interactions.
    This study endeavours to determine the effects of two powdered detergents at different
    concentrations on the agronomic features of lettuce cultivated in soil and water
    culture media. Different concentrations of detergents have varying effects on
    the agronomic features of lettuce (<em>Lactuca sativa</em> L.) plants in both
    hydroponics and soil systems. The concentrations used the experiment were 0.03%,
    0.05% and 0.1% of the two powdered laundry detergents, namely detergent A and
    detergent B. The root length, leaf length and number of leaves were recorded every
    two days during a four- week period. After harvest, the fresh and dry weights
    of roots and shoots of each plant were recorded. The growth of lettuce plants
    in the wet system of hydroponics was more negatively affected compared to those
    grown in soil with &gt;50% more leaves and &gt; 50% longer roots. Lettuce plants
    respond differently to detergents A and B, detergent B negatively affected plant
    growth while detergent A positively influenced growth. With increasing detergent
    concentrations, it was found that the agronomic parameters displayed a decline
    in the soil medium and an increase in the wet hydroponic system. However, based
    on the survival rate, hydroponically-grown lettuce plants succumbed more to the
    effects of pollutants in the detergent at higher concentrations when compared
    to plants grown in soil.
