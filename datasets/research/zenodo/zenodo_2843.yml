  title: Isolation, Selection and Identification of Nitrogen Fixation Rhizospheric
    and Endophytic Bacteria from Maize (Zea Mays L.) Grown on the Soil
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> N-free medium (Nfb,\
    \ LGI and Burks) were used to isolate bacteria having nitrogen fixation characteristics.\
    \ Quantitative measurement by colorimetric methods helped to select the best isolates\
    \ of nitrogen-fixing and IAA biosynthesis. The result of isolation was a total\
    \ of 30 rhizopheric and 150 endophytic isolates having the both abilities. Sixty\
    \ isolates having good biofertilizer activity were chosen to study. Isolates strains\
    \ have both nitrogen fixation produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in vitro. Six\
    \ selected isolates had 16S rDNA sequences similarities with bacterial strains\
    \ in data of GenBank with the values ranging between 94% and 99% of similarity\
    \ in which includes strains of Enterobacter ludwigii DNL14, Enterobacter kobei\
    \ DNT5, Bacillus pumilus DBT4, Klebsiella pneumoniae DNR5, Lactobacillus plantarum\
    \ DLR6, Pseudomonas nitroreducens DND5. Especially, strains of endophytic isolates\
    \ root maize origin as Klebsiella pneumoniae DNR5 biofertilizer activities synthesized\
    \ average highest as NH4 (5.64 mg/L) and IAA (5.29mg/L) which can be exploited\
    \ for enhancing soil fertility and plant growth."
