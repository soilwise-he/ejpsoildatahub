  title: Background Movement Effects in Tracer-diffusion in Pure and Soil Systems
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp;. Soil Science. Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani-741 235 <em>Manuscript received 6 July 1984,\
    \ accepted 29 October 1985</em> Tracer-diffusion experiments in pure and soil\
    \ systems have been conducted in order to provide an experimental test of the\
    \ predictions regarding ionic (background) movement in tracer\xB7 diffusion. The\
    \ effect of valency of tracer cation on such background movement has also been\
    \ investigated, and the results agree, at a qualitative level, with those predicted\
    \ theoretically."
