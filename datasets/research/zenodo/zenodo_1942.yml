    &lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Plant roots play a key role in stabilizing slopes, particularly in the
    Mediterranean region, characterized by rough and unstable terrain. However, forest
    species differ in their stabilizing capacities. The purpose of this study is to
    fill the gap of knowledge on root biomechanical properties of relevant Mediterranean
    trees and shrubs in relation to slope stability. Root specimens of typical montane
    Mediterranean tree and shrub species were sampled in Southern Italy. Root characteristics,
    such as tensile strength (Tr) and root area ratio (RAR), were assessed from live
    roots sampled in trenches, while root cohesion was calculated. Power law functions
    yielded the best fit for the relationship of Tr versus root diameter; however,
    no significant relationship was found between root strength and root moisture
    content. RAR varied amongst di different tree and shrub species. Roots of Quercus
    cerris L. were the most resistant to breaking under tension, while roots of Ilex
    aquifolium L. had the highest tensile strength among all shrub species. Results
    provide quantitative information on the role of root systems of montane Mediterranean
    forest species in stabilizing soils and will improve modeling of landslide susceptibility
    to the prevention and mitigation of natural hazards in mountain environments.&lt;/p&gt;'
