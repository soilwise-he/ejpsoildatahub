  title: Stand age characteristics and soil properties affect species composition
    of vascular plants in short rotation coppice plantations
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Woody biomass plantations on agricultural sites are an attractive\
    \ source of biomass for bioenergy, but their effects on local biodiversity are\
    \ unclear. This study\u2019s objective was to evaluate the influences of light\
    \ availability, plantation age, and soil properties on phytodiversity in short\
    \ rotation coppice (SRC) plantations. Ground vegetation mapping, irradiance measurement\
    \ (PAR), and surface soil analyses were conducted in 15 willow and poplar SRC\
    \ plantations in Central Sweden and Northern Germany. We performed different multivariate\
    \ statistical methods like cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis\
    \ (PCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in order to analyze species\
    \ composition and the influence of irradiance, age, and soil properties on phytodiversity.\
    \ CA revealed highest species composition similarities in SRC plantations in close\
    \ proximity. PCA identified humus quality/essential plant nutrients, plantation\
    \ age/irradiance effects, soil acidity and shoot age as the four principal components\
    \ of the recorded parameters. The ground vegetation cover was negatively correlated\
    \ with the plantation age component and positively with the nutrient component.\
    \ With an increase in the plantation age component, a shift in species composition\
    \ was proven towards more forest habitat species, more nutrient-demanding species,\
    \ and increasing occurrence of indicator species for basic soils. Applying Ellenberg\
    \ indicator values, basic soil indicator species corresponded in occurrence to\
    \ increasing nutrient availability. However, species richness was not related\
    \ to any of our studied site variables. Judged from CCA, species composition in\
    \ SRC plantations was influenced by plantation age/irradiance, and nutrient availability;\
    \ soil acidity and shoot age had no significant influence. Young poplar and willow\
    \ SRC plantations showed greatest variation in photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (PAR). Our findings suggest that phytodiversity in SRC plantations depends mainly\
    \ on plantation age and thus shifts over time.&lt;/p&gt;"
