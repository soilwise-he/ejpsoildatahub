  title: An assessment of rice straw-based composting with urea and soil
  abstract: Rice is one of the primary crops in many Asian countries. However, the
    management of rice straw remains a challenge in Asia where burning rice straw
    is the popular practice among farmers. Rice straw burning have a lot of consequences
    such as loss of nutrients and biodiversity, soil degradation, air pollution, and
    harmful to human health. Composting rice straw is a potential alternative method.
    To optimize the composting process, mixing straw with nitrogen-rich material such
    as cattle and poultry manure is necessary. However, the availability of animal
    manure can be a challenge in some areas, so alternative materials can be used
    like Urea and soil. In this study, composting rice straw in combination with soil
    and urea was investigated. Three beds with mixed ratios (50:50, 70:30 and 70:30)
    of rice straw and soil was used. The solution consists of water, urea, superphosphate,
    potassium, molasses, and liquid inoculant was added to the compost bed to achieve
    a moisture content of 60%. The beds were turned or mixed every 7 days up to 45
    days. When the composting process was completed, the result show that the temperature
    of the bed during the composting process remained above 550C during the 2nd week,
    continuously, and the highest temperature reached 64.30C on the 9th and 10th days.
    The particle size passing through the sieve (5mm, 10mm) is 45.4% to 66.2 %. The
    weight loss ranged from 41.2 kg (29.4 %); 29.1 kg (29.1 %); 30.7 kg (30.7 %).
    The pH achieved neutral levels of 7.04; 7.16; 7.26 on the 45 days. The C/N ratio
    of three beds where 12.2; 11.9; 11.3, respectively. The total density of microorganisms
    remained at a stable level from 1x 108 cfu/g of input to 109 cfu/g of output.
    The results showed the feasibility of rice straw treatment via in-situ composting
    combined with soil and urea. This is a practice that assists the farmers in utilizing
    the available rice straw to make compost which contributes to circular rice production.
