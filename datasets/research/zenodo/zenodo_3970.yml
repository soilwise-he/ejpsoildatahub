  title: Secondary Structure Prediction And Restriction Site Analysis Of Streptomyces
    Sp Isolated From Valparai Hill Station Soil Sites
  abstract: '<strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong>


    <strong><em>I</em></strong><em>n the current paper soil samples were collected
    </em><em>from Valparai hil station</em><em> sites to screen the diversity of actinomycetes.
    The potential actinomycetes were isolated by serial dilution and plating method
    on starch peptone agar media in the incubation of 7 days. After incubation morphological
    characterization was carried on the basis of shape and elevation characteristics
    on starch peptone agar and most dominative Streptomyces isolate were picked and
    carried for further inoculation. Streptomyces RRMVCBNR</em><em> isolate was Phenotypic
    characterized on the basis of microscopic, colony morphology, biochemical and
    phenotypic studies. Which was further confirmed by genotypic studies based on
    16S rRNA gene sequences followed by phylogenetic tree construction. 16S rRNA gene
    sequences of strain used in this study exhibited sequence similarity in the range
    of 99-100% with those of selected isolate and it was identified as Streptomyces
    RRMVCBNR. The sequences of 16S rRNA genes were deposited in genbank and received
    the accession number MG287121.The FASTA product was used to Secondary Structure
    prediction and Restriction site analysis of Streptomyces RRMVCBNR. Further activity
    of Streptomyces RRMVCBNR strain showed highest antibacterial activity against
    Staphylococcus aureus has been studied.</em>
