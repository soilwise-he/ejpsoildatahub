  title: Efficacy evaluation of chromium(VI) adsorption on clay soil blended with
    Azadiracta indica (Neem) and Moringa oleifera (Drum stick) seed shell
  abstract: 'Department of Civil Engineering, Department of Earth and Environmental
    Studies, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Durgapur, Durgapur-713 209, West
    Bengal, India <em>E-mail</em>: chandrimakol10@gmail.com <em>Manuscript received
    online 01 February 2019, accepted 25 March 2019</em> In the present study, the
    adsorptive removal efficiency of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions was examined by
    using locally available clay soil amended with <em>Azadiracta indica</em> (AI)
    (Neem) and <em>Moringa oleifera</em> (MO) (Drum stick trees) seed shell as adsorbent.
    The amended adsorbent dosage were varied 10 through 20% in clay soil to assess
    the maximum percentage Cr(VI) removal from the aqueous solutions at optimal pH
    (6.5) and equilibrium reaction time. It was observed that Cr(VI) adsorption efficiency
    increased with the increment of both AI and MO dosage in the soil. However, AI
    blended clay soil showed more pro-mising Cr(VI) removal percentage (90%) in comparison
    to MO amended soil at same level of the adsorbent dosage.'
