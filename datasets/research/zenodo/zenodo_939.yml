  title: Soil-foundation modelling for vulnerability assessment of buildings in liquefied
    soils
  abstract: Recent events have demonstrated that earthquake-induced liquefaction can
    result in significant structural damage and human casualties. The consideration
    of soil liquefaction has primarily been the domain of geotechnical engineering;
    however, recent studies have shown a strong interaction between liquefaction-development
    and the superstructure loads. Not only does liquefaction lead to a change in the
    shaking demands on the superstructure, it also changes the flexibility of the
    soil-foundation-structure system. Meanwhile, the high static shear forces from
    the foundation loads can result in a reduction or increase in pore pressure development.
    This strong soil-liquefaction-foundation-structure interaction (SLFSI) is a challenge
    for both geotechnical and structural engineers. This paper develops an efficient
    numerical procedure for the vulnerability assessment of buildings with shallow
    foundations to the combined impacts of seismic shaking and liquefaction. The approach
    quantifies settlement and soil stiffness as time series to allow SLFSI to be considered
    in structural modelling in a simplified manner. The time series are developed
    through a combination of finite difference fully-coupled effective-stress modelling
    in FLAC and through analytical and empirical expressions based on key parameters.
    The framework is used to assess the vulnerability of a 3-storey reinforced concrete
    frame building to liquefaction and ground shaking.
