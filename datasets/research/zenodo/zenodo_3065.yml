  title: Application of Growth Regulators and Saprophytic Fungi Trichoderma viride
    Pers ex Fr. to Improve the Sanitary Condition of the Soil under Pepper Crops
  abstract: The article presents studies of the effect of the microbiological preparation
    "Trichodermine", bio-organic fertilizers and growth regulators based on humic
    acids "Nagro", "Stimix", "BioLife" and mineral fertilizers (NPK) on the biological
    activity of the soil, the degree of disease caused by Alternaria capsici-annui
    Savul &amp; Sandu and the yield of pepper in the field. It was found that the
    differences in the indicator "Biological Activity of the Soil" depend on the number
    of microorganisms, the composition (species diversity) and the percentage of the
    main Micromycetes. Organic products help to optimize soil health and reduce the
    total content of fungal colonies, and in the composition of Micromycetes, the
    fungus Trichoderma sp. is more common. When mineral fertilizers are applied, the
    number of fungal pathogens and toxin producers increases. A higher total yield
    was obtained in the variants with biological treatment. The yield increase is
    from 9% to 29%.
