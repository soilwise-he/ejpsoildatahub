  title: Effect of thermal stabilization of soil, bentonite, calcium carbonate and
    fibers on behavior properties of clay soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Various factors, including the thermal stabilization and the presence
    of chemicals such as bentonite for the protection of nuclear waste lead to the
    exposure of clay soil to the heat. Besides, the presence of large amounts of carbonate
    as one of the main components of clay soils, especially in the arid and semi-arid
    regions, and its effect on the soil engineering properties emphasize the necessity
    to study the combined effect of heat and carbonate on the engineering behavior
    of clay soils. Accordingly, the present paper studies the interaction of clay-bentonite,
    clay-lime, and clay-fiber at high temperatures and its effect on the properties
    of clay soils. In this regard, a series of macro-structural experiments are conducted.
    The different thermal levels considered in the present study, according to the
    previous research, are 0 to 900. The soil behavior is investigated using numerical
    and laboratory methods. The experiments conducted in this area include the weight
    changes and the unconfined compressive strength of the soil. The effect of using
    the bentonite and fiber on the strength indicates that at a given temperature,
    increasing the percentage of bentonite leads to increased strength. In addition,
    the rate of increase is different at different temperatures, so that the highest
    increase occurs for the addition of 30% bentonite to the soil, reaching the unconfined
    compressive strength to 1.88 times the control sample. However, adding 0.5% fiber
    and 4% lime shows the maximum strength.&lt;/p&gt;'
