  title: RESPONSE OF ZINC IN ALLUVIAL SOIL FOR HIGHER YIELD OF WHEAT
  abstract: <em>In crop production, the importance of Zn was realized due to raising
    its deficiency from intensified agriculture, increasing prevalence of high yielding
    crop varieties, multiple cropping. These factors have combined to create large
    gaps between the soil Zn supply and crop requirements. The zinc deficiency in
    the soil adversely affects crop yield and nutritional quality. Zinc levels had
    significantly beneficial effect on the straw / dry matter yields of the rabi crops
    over control in both crop seasons. The best results in linseed, lentil and cabbage
    were obtained at 7.5 kg Zn ha-1, in wheat at 10 kg Zn per Ha and in berseem at
    5 kg Zn per Ha. Zinc uptake was highest in wheat crop. The uptake of Zn by these
    crops increased significantly with its addition over control in both the years.</em>
