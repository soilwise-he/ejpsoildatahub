  title: EVALUATING REFLECTIVE SPECTROSCOPY FOR PREDICTING SOIL PROPERTIES IN GAJAPATI
    DISTRICT, ODISHA
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> Visible near-infrared spectroscopy, renowned
    for its non-destructive nature, rapidity, cost-efficiency, and minimal sample
    preparation requirements, holds promise as a substitute for in vitro techniques.
    This ongoing study aims to evaluate the viability of reflective spectroscopy for
    predicting soil properties in ion farming plains across Gajapati district Odisha.
    A meticulous collection of 110 soil samples from these regions formed the basis,
    with their core attributes established using conventional in vitro methods. Employing
    a land spectroscopic device, the soil samples underwent spectral analysis within
    the wavelength band of 240 to 400 nm. Following spectrum recording, diverse pre-processing
    approaches were assessed, paving the way for the application of PCA (Principal
    Component Analysis) and PLSR (Partial Least Squares Regression) models to decipher
    pivotal soil properties. The superior model choice was subsequently employed to
    formulate regressive functions, facilitating the prediction of targeted parameters
    through linear regression. Findings spotlight the precision of both PCA and PLSR
    models in elucidating soil properties, with the latter displaying heightened accuracy.
    Evaluated using the RPD (Ratio of Performance to Deviation) metric, the most accurate
    estimations were achieved for minerals (RPD=9.34), pH (RPD=4.45), and nitrogen
    (RPD&gt;2), all classified within category A. In contrast, accuracy proved lower
    for variables like clay, silt, gravel, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
    and gypsum, where RPD values ranged between 0.01 and 0.28. These values collectively
    affirm the satisfactory precision of spectral regressive functions in forecasting
    the targeted foundational properties. In summary, outcomes of this study underscore
    the commendable precision of both PCA and PLSR models in determining crucial soil
    parameters. Moreover, soil spectral data emerges as an effective indirect means
    to estimate the physical and chemical attributes of soil. Compared to conventional
    laboratory methods, this technique emerges as a more cost-effective alternative,
    enhancing efficiency in terms of both time and cost while maintaining heightened
    precision.
