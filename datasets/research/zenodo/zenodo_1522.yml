  title: Development Of Analytical Relationships Among Engineering Properties Of Lateritic
    Soil As Pavement Materials
  abstract: "Laterite are soil types with the oxides of iron, aluminum, titanium,\
    \ zircon, manganese, zinc and Quartz, they very significantly according to their\
    \ location, climate and depth. Its use as pavement material depends on its index\
    \ and engineering properties which are obtained experimentally in the laboratory\
    \ or institution. Results on the strength and index properties of laterite as\
    \ subgrade, sub base and base course material are collected from different geotechnical\
    \ laboratories indicating the grain size distribution, Atterberg\u2019s limit,\
    \ Compaction test and the CBR test for the lateritic soil. The obtained equations\
    \ through the use of SPSS and Least Square regression analysis shows that there\
    \ exist relations among the engineering properties of laterite with the former\
    \ producing greater degree of accuracy, more flexibility and higher ease of computation.\
    \ The application of these statistical tools in determining the engineering properties\
    \ of lateritic soil will reduce the length of time spent obtaining these properties\
    \ experimentally; reduction in construction cost and time spent and eliminate\
    \ errors that are likely to occur during experiments."
