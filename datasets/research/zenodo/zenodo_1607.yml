  title: Interaction of Continuous Fertilization Practices on Tembotrione Degradation
    in Tropical Soil of India
  abstract: Laboratory incubation experiment was conducted using the soil collected
    from Long Term Fertilization (LTF) Experiment plots cultivated with Finger millet-maize
    cropping sequence. The study was aimed to investigate the influence of different
    long-term fertilization practices and rates of TMB application on its persistence
    and degradation behavior in <em>Typic Ustropept</em> soil. The results are showed
    concentration of TMB residue on day 1, ranged from 0.459 to 0.622, 0.504-1.061,
    and 0.629-1.348 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> across different LTF practices at 60, 120,
    and 240 g/ha application rates. Higher TMB residue was recorded by 100 % NPK (-S)
    practice at 60 and 240 g/ha rates and 150 % NPK at 120 g/ha rate and the 100%
    NPK+ FYM basis recorded lower TMB residue on 1<sup>st</sup> day of incubation.
    Tembotrione degradation follows 1<sup>st</sup> order kinetics of dissipation irrespective
    of dose and LTF practices. Application of 100%NPK+FYM and omission of K fertilizer
    practices followed the best fit with 2<sup>nd</sup>-order kinetics. More than
    50 % of the initial tembotrione deposit dissipated on the 15<sup>th</sup> and
    30<sup>th</sup> at 60 g/ha and at 120,240 g/ha doses respectively irrespective
    of LTF practices. Tembotrione dissipated with the degradation half-lives of 10.19
    to 14.71 days. Half-life of tembotrione ranged from 9.39-22.27 days across the
    LTF practices and rates of its application. Tembotrione degradation half-life
    increased with the increased rate of application and the mean HL was calculated
    to be 9.39-13.72,14.26-20.51 and 18.94-22.27 days respectively at 60, 120 and
    240 g/ha. Lowest and highest HL of 14.30 and 19.86 days was observed with 100%NPK(-S)
    and 100%NPK+FYM respectively and the tembotrione residue was detected in soil
    up to 60 days irrespective of its application rate. This indicates the existence
    of interaction between the nutrients management practices and its persistence
    in soil.
