  title: Effect Of Crude Oil On Soil-Water Characteristic Curve Of Clayey Soil
  abstract: The measured soil suction values when related to water content is called
    suction-water content relationship (SWR) or soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC)
    and forms the basis of unsaturated soil behavior assessment. The SWCC can be measured
    or predicted based on soil index properties such as grain-size distribution and
    plasticity index. In this paper, the SWCC of clean and contaminated clayey soil
    classified as clay with low plasticity (CL) are presented. Laboratory studies
    were conducted on virgin (disturbed-uncontaminated soil collected from vicinity
    of Tehran oil refinery) soil and soil samples simulated to varying degrees of
    contamination with crude oil (i.e., 3, 6, and 9% by dry weight of soil) to compare
    the results before and after contamination. Laboratory tests were conducted using
    a device which is capable of measuring volume change and pore pressures. The soil
    matric suction at the ends of samples controlled by using the axis translation
    technique. The results show that contamination with crude oil facilitates the
    movement of water and reduces the soil suction.
