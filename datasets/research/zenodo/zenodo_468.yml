  title: 'Soil invertebrates in the Tropics: a bibliographical revision.'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The invertebrates are the most diverse group in the world; they
    colonize almost all the ecosystems and certainly give many goods and services
    to the human beings. The invertebrates that live in the soil contribute consistently
    with changes in the ecosystemic functions, affecting directly: nutrients, cycle,
    change in biomass contain ecological nets and inter specific relations for more
    voluminous organisms. For this exercise were taken the information of the six
    more representative magazines (2010-2016). The invertebrates in the tropics are
    maybe the most diverse group, although in the checking stage carried out only
    64% represented tropical zones or subtropical exclusively, the rest is a comparison
    with temperate zones or global studious. Because of its diversity, many invertebrates
    are waiting for their taxonomical descriptions; many specialists are not from
    tropical countries. Brazil is the country with more investigations about this
    theme with its own investigators. No all the invertebrates have received the same
    attention, and the most studied groups are the orders Hymenoptera (20%), Coleopteran
    (12%) and Araneae (6%), many families without identification (25%), distinguishing
    studious in Fomicidae (24%) and Scarabaeinae (8%) mainly. The tendency is to work
    with those that are better described. The articles selected constitute a key for
    identifying the most useable methodologies, where the fall trap (30%), quadrant
    (11%) and transecto (9%), are remarkable over 24 methodologies, the most widespread
    time of studious was for only one season (&lt; 1 year) the central point of the
    search in the soil (40%) and the fallen leaves (38%).&lt;/p&gt;'
