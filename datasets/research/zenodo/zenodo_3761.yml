  title: Prediction Of Phenolic Compound Migration Process Through Soil Media Using
    Artificial Neural Network Approach
  abstract: 'This study presents the application of artificial

    neural network for modeling the phenolic compound

    migration through vertical soil column. A three layered feed

    forward neural network with back propagation training

    algorithm was developed using forty eight experimental data

    sets obtained from laboratory fixed bed vertical column tests.

    The input parameters used in the model were the influent

    concentration of phenol(mg/L) on the top end of the soil

    column, depth of the soil column (cm), elapsed time after

    phenol injection (hr), percentage of clay (%), percentage of

    silt (%) in soils. The output of the ANN was the effluent

    phenol concentration (mg/L) from the bottom end of the soil

    columns. The ANN predicted results were compared with the

    experimental results of the laboratory tests and the accuracy of

    the ANN model was evaluated.'
