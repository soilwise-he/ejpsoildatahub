  title: Studies on the Effect of Phosphate, EDTA and Added Micronutrient on the Availability
    of Zinc in Soil
  abstract: Department of Agril, Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra Krishi
    Viswa Vidyalaya, Kalyani, West Bengal <em>Manuscript received 22 August 1979,
    accepted 9 January 1980</em> The DTPA-extractable zinc status of two alluvial
    soils on incubation at moisture saturation under native and fertilized conditions
    have been studied. It was found that the application of a lower dose of phosphate
    caused an immediate increase in available Zn in both native and Zn treated soils
    but with higher dose of phosphate and on prolonged incubation a general decrease
    was observed. On adding organic matter as EDTA, phosphate treated soils showed
    as increase but one of the Zn-treated soils showed a<strong> </strong>decreasing
    trend which is the general case for all soils on prolonged incubation.
