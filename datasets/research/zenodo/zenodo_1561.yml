  title: Scanning electron microscopy investigation of loess soil stabilized with
    cement and natural zeolite
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Zeolite and Portland cement have been used to stabilize a loess
    soil from the region of Kozloduy&nbsp;(North Bulgaria). This paper examines the
    microstructural behavior of cement&ndash;zeolite treated loess soil without&nbsp;compaction
    at water content higher than optimum. Scanning electron microscopy and semi-quantitative&nbsp;energy
    dispersive spectroscopy analyses on stabilized loess were carried out after various
    curing periods. The&nbsp;identification of the formation of cementitious products
    in treated loess soil was conducted by SEM&ndash;EDS&nbsp;spectral analysis. Based
    on the study of the microstructural development, it was found that the modified
    loess&nbsp;microstructure undergoes significant modifications during the observed
    period.&lt;/p&gt;'
