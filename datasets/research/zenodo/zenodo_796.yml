  title: Effect of Bio-Slurry On Tomato Production In Floodplain Soil
  abstract: A field experiment was conducted at the Soil Science Field Laboratory,
    Bangladesh Agricultural University,<br> Mymensingh, in order to evaluate the performance
    of bio-slurry on the production of tomato on floodplain soil.<br> The experiment
    was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replications
    and<br> comprised of six treatments viz., T. - Control, T, - Recommended fertilizer
    Dose (RFD), T2 - 60% RFD +<br> Poultry Manure (PM), T3 - 60% RFD + Poultry slurry,
    T. - 60% RFD + Cow-dung (CD), Ts - 60% RFD +<br> Cow-dung slurry. The growth and
    yield of tomato were significantly influenced by the application of<br> different
    manure. The tallest (61.10cm) plant was observed in Tz (Poultry Manure) while
    the shortest plant<br> (25.17cm) was found in T, (control). The highest number
    of fruits plant" (27.87) was produced in T,<br> (RFD) and it was lowest (9.77)
    in T. (Control). The highest average fruit weight (50.00 g fruit') was<br> observed
    in T2 (Poultry Manure) and the lowest (26.00 g fruit') was in T, (control). The
    highest yield (27.20<br> t ha') was recorded in T3 (60% RFD+ Poultry slurry) followed
    by T, (18.87 t ha*'), 12(16.13 t ha'), TA (16.03<br> tha''), Ts (15.15 t ha')
    and the lowest (8.35 t ha*') in control T, (control). The yield of tomato were
    increased<br> by 126, 93, 225, 92 and 81% over control in T.(100% RFD), T2 (60%
    RFD+ Poultry manure), T; (60% RFD+<br> Poultry slurry), T4 (60% RFD+ Cow-dung),
    and Ts (60% RFD+ Cow-dung slurry), respectively
