  title: Experimental study of the mechanical effect of a clayey soil by adding rubber
    powder for geotechnical applications
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;At present, worrying quantities of tires are discarded due to
    the growth in demand for vehicles in the world, which has a direct impact on the
    deterioration of the environment since they normally go to landfills. Based on
    the background found, the use of this material for geotechnical applications can
    help reduce the pollution they generate and improve the physical and mechanical
    properties of soils. Therefore, this research seeks to evaluate a greater shear
    strength and capacity of support to the penetration of the clayey soil by means
    of the addition of 1.5%, 2.5% and 3.5% of rubber powder recycled. For this, the
    Atterberg limits analysis, the modified proctor compaction test, shear box and
    CBR were performed. For the shear box test, the results reflect that the cohesion
    of the mixture increased and the angle of internal friction decreased with respect
    to the natural soil, resulting in the sum in an increase of shear strength. On
    the other hand, the percentage of CBR increased, this means that the rubber helped
    the soil to be more rigid and have a greater resistance to penetration. These
    mixtures could be used in different projects within geotechnical engineering,
    as it presents an improvement in shear strength and an acceptable support index
    value (CBR).&lt;/p&gt;'
