  title: Heavy Metals Transport In The Soil Profiles Under The Application Of Sludge
    And Wastewater
  abstract: 'Heavy metal transfer in soil profiles is a major

    environmental concern because even slow transport through the soil

    may eventually lead to deterioration of groundwater quality. The use

    of sewage sludge and effluents from wastewater treatment plants for

    irrigation of agricultural lands is on the rise particularly in peri-urban

    area of developing countries. In this study soil samples under sludge

    application and wastewater irrigation were studied and soil samples

    were collected in the soil profiles from the surface to 100 cm in

    depth. For this purpose, three plots were made in a treatment plant in

    south of Tehran-Iran. First plot was irrigated just with effluent from

    wastewater treatment plant, second plot with simulated heavy metals

    concentration equal 50 years irrigation and in third plot sewage

    sludge and effluent was used. Trace metals concentration (Cd, Cu)

    were determined for soil samples. The results indicate movement of

    metals was observed, but the most concentration of metals was found

    in topsoil samples. The most of Cadmium concentration was

    measured in the topsoil of plot 3, 4.5mg/kg and Maximum cadmium

    movement was observed in 0-20 cm. The most concentration of

    copper was 27.76mg/kg, and maximum percolation in 0-20 cm.

    Metals (Cd, Cu) were measured in leached water. Preferential flow

    and metal complexation with soluble organic apparently allow

    leaching of heavy metals.'
