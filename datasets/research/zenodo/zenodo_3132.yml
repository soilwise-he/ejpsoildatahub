  title: Integration of Mineral Fertilization with Chitosan, K-Humate and K-Silicate
    to Enhance Nutrients Availability and their Uptake by Maize under Sandy Soil Conditions
  abstract: "This study aims\_to compare the effects of the combination between the\
    \ mineral N-P-K fertilization and the foliar sprayed chitosan (Chs), potassium-humate\
    \ (K-H), and potassium-silicate (K-Si) on the nutrients uptake by the maize crop\
    \ planted in sandy soil. The field experiments were carried at the Ismailia agricultural\
    \ research station (2022 and 2023 summer seasons). The experiments were conducted\
    \ in a split-split plot design with three replicates. The main plots were presented\
    \ as follows; 50%, 75% and 100% of recommended N-P-K doses. While, sub plots were\
    \ assigned for foliar sprayed (control (CL), Chs, K-H and K-Si). Results have\
    \ indicated that\_the most significant increase in the grains yield was by 76.5%\
    \ for the Chs at the 50% rate and by 56.7% and 48.8% for the K-Si at the 75%,\
    \ and 100% N-P-K, respectively. The highest significant available N concentration\
    \ was by 71.4%, 70.5% and 33.1 for the Chs, obtained at the 75%, 50%, and 100%\
    \ N-P-K rates, respectively. The Chs has showed the highest concentration of the\
    \ soil-available P by 69.5% and 59% at the 100% and 50% N-P-K rates, respectively.\
    \ The available K (mg kg-1) in soil was varied significantly. The sprayed K-Si\
    \ was almost the most significant treatment has increased the uptake\_(kg ha-1)\_\
    of the N, P, and K in the ranges 69.9 \u2013 202.6%, 12.6 \u2013 109.1%, and 71\
    \ \u2013 99.9%, respectively, within the 50% \u2013 100% range of the N-P-K mineral\
    \ fertilization"
