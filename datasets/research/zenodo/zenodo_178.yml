  title: Spatio-Temporal Variations In Soil Moisture And Soil Temperature Under High
    Density Guava Orchard System
  abstract: "The knowledge and understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of\
    \ soil water content and soil temperature is of great importance for determining\
    \ a soil sampling strategy, for understanding and modeling of water and nutrient\
    \ movement, and for many other investigations associated with the water and nutrient\
    \ management in high density plantations. Keeping this in view, seasonal variations\
    \ in soil moisture and soil temperature were monitored during 2011 at active root\
    \ zone depth of 15 cm at 0.5 and 1.0 m away from tree trunk in twenty years old\
    \ guava cultivar Allahabad Safeda planted at four different spacings (1.5 \xD7\
    3.0, 3.0 \xD73.0, 3.0 \xD7 6.0 and 6.0 \xD7 6.0 m). In-situ soil moisture dynamics\
    \ over space and time scale existed in the high density guava orchard ecosystem\
    \ and the variability was mainly governed by the climatic factors particularly\
    \ rainfall, evaporation, temperature and wind speed. Lower moisture retention\
    \ was observed in higher density as compared to low density plantation because\
    \ of the root zone competition in closely spaced plants. Temporal variations in\
    \ soil temperature was also revealed. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot\
    \ repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down."
