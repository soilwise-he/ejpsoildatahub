  title: PHYSICO-CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SOME MACRONUTRIENTS FROM SOIL IN SELECTED VILLAGES
    OF ANJANGAON SURJI TALUKA OF AMRAVATI DISTRICT, MAHARASHTRA STATE
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>PUSA STFR METER KIT of Soil Test and Fertilizer
    Recommendation System used for determination for PH, Electrical conductivity,
    Organic carbon, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese,
    Boron and Nitrogen. The conductometry techniques used to measure conductance of
    micronutrients, and pH metric analysis indicating the pH of soil. In analysis
    of soil, soil sampling technique, determination of texture, water content, organic
    matter, air content, and soil pH. We have used five type of soil samples for analysis
    at different places. The soil are extracted successfully from main area of farm
    places. In the determination of texture of soil. The water holding capacity of
    the farm soil has slightly decreased due to the deposition of hydrophobic organic
    matter in the soil. The pH of the soil has been increased may due to the presence
    of alkaline and alkaline earth metals in the soil. The electrical conductivity
    of soil in liquid medium has increased may due to containing ionic matter into
    the soil through fertilizer utilization. The research study may helpful in the
    vitality of good soil management to ensure high sustainable production for economic
    viability as well as to maintain or improvement in soil fertility. </em> <strong><em>KEYWORDS:
