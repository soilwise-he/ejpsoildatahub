  title: Dynamic characteristics of the working bodies of cultivators during the intensified
    process of soil cultiva-tion
  abstract: The article discusses a laboratory experimental study of the oscillations
    of the S-shaped stand of the cultivator working body in order to determine its
    main parameters during the implementation of the soil loosening process. The studies
    carried out made it possible to obtain results by which it is possible to track
    the nature of changes in the main indicators of the loosening process, which is
    accompanied by deformations of the elastic strut of the working body and have
    a vibration nature, which determines the process of soil cultivation by oscillatory
    working bodies, such as acceleration, angular velocities, Euler orientation angles,
    efforts resistance forces, displacement of the end of the rack, spectral density
    of vibration accelerations and spectral density of traction. The expediency of
    using stochastic approaches has been substantiated while ensuring a sufficient
    level of reliability indicators of the elastic struts of the working bodies of
    tillage aggregates at the design stage. 93 m/s to 2.5 m/s. The presence of oscillations
    characterized by the difference between the force of resistance to the movement
    of the working body before the destruction (loosening) of the soil and the force
    of resistance to the movement of the organ during loosening is recorded, which
    confirms the use of a stepwise two-stage model of changing the resistance forces.
    The possibility of sudden failures of the cultivator rack as a result of the impact
    of obstacles located on the working trajectory of the organs of the tillage aggregates
    has been substantiated. Under the action of an extreme load in laboratory conditions,
    a sharp increase in the deformation of the strut relative to the operating mode
    by 6.5 times was recorded.
