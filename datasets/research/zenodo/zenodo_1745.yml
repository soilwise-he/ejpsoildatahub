  title: Prevalence Of Soil-Transmitted Helminthes In Vegetables Sold In Bali Markets,
    Taraba State, Nigeria
  abstract: In Nigeria, leafy vegetables form essential part of dietary foods especially
    in the South-eastern part. This is because of enormous supplements derived from
    them that affect human health positively. These benefits derived were however
    reduced drastically by incidence of soil-transmitted helminthes associated ailments
    in humans who consumed these vegetables on daily basis. This present study was
    carried out to determine the prevalence of soil transmitted helminthes in vegetables
    sold in Bali markets. Parasitological investigation of vegetables for parasitic
    stages of soil transmitted helminthes was conducted using centrifugation and microscopical
    methods. Out of nine vegetable samples examined 55.55% were positive for helminthes
    eggs contamination, 4.55% in bitter leaf and hibiscus leaves, 22.73% in moringa
    leaves, 54.55% in okra leaves and 13.64% in clove basil. Two larvae were found
    in bitter leaf and three larvae were also found in pumpkin or marrow leaves. Most
    of the helminthes detected in the vegetables were <em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>
    and <em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em> while <em>Necator americanus</em> were low
    in prevalence. No parasites were detected in samples collected from leaves of
    spiny amaranth and black Beniseed. The results showed that highest prevalence
    rate was found in okra leaves while the lowest was bitter leaf and hibiscus leaves.
    The distribution of these helminthes in these leafy vegetables were responsible
    for the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminthes associated ailments in Bali.
    Finally, vegetables should be properly washed with salt to deter predisposing
    factor for infection of soil-transmitted helminthes.
