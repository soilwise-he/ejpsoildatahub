  title: Carbon sequestration and soil properties in forests of Nepal
  abstract: Forest soils are important for nutrient cycling and development of forest
    vegetation. The importance of forests of Nepal in carbon storage is globally recognized.
    In this context, this study reports the findings of systematic analyses of the
    published journal articles in the past fifty years of Nepal on forest soils of
    Nepal. It is found that restoration of the degraded forest land is important for
    maintaining forest soil properties and carbon storage. Socioeconomic factors such
    as population reduction, promoting off-farm employment and economic incentives
    are important to reverse forest land degradation.
