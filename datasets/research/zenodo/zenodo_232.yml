  title: Waste Water Treatment Using Soil Bioreactor
  abstract: 'The main focus of this project is to bring the water to acceptable limits
    of pollution control board with green technology and economy. For this purpose,
    we decided to treat the sugar factory waste water using a soil bioreactor. This
    is a latest green technology to treat water. We are trying to bring the water
    up to level which becomes suitable for irrigation. The social impact of the project
    is that farmer will get good quality water for irrigation. Sugar industry will
    get a very economical and green technology to treating their waste water. So,
    we are expecting that sugar factories will use this technique.
