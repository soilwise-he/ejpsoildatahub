  title: Threshold Stress Of The Soil Subgrade Evaluation For Highway Formations
  abstract: 'The objective of this study is to evaluate the threshold

    stress of the clay with sand subgrade soil. Threshold stress can be

    defined as the stress level above which cyclic loading leads to

    excessive deformation and eventual failure. The thickness

    determination of highways formations using the threshold stress

    approach is a more realistic assessment of the soil behaviour because

    it is subjected to repeated loadings from moving vehicles. Threshold

    stress can be evaluated by plastic strain criterion, which is based on

    the accumulated plastic strain behaviour during cyclic loadings [1].

    Several conditions of the all-round pressure the subgrade soil namely,

    zero confinement, low all-round pressure and high all-round pressure

    are investigated. The threshold stresses of various soil conditions are

    determined. Threshold stress of the soil are 60%, 31% and 38.6% for

    unconfined partially saturated sample, low effective stress saturated

    sample, high effective stress saturated sample respectively.'
