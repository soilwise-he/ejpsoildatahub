  title: Utilization of Bamboo Fibers for Modification of Black Cotton Soil Properties
  abstract: 'Soil stabilization is the process which involves enhancing the physical
    properties of the soil in order to improve its strength, durability etc. by blending
    or mixing with additives. The different types of method used for soil stabilization
    are Soil stabilization with cement, Soil stabilization with lime, Soil stabilization
    using bitumen, Chemical stabilization and a new emerging technology of stabilization
    by Geo textiles and Geo synthetic fibers. In this study, we are making use of
    bamboo fibers as geo synthetic material for stabilization of soil. With the introduction
    of bamboo fibers to the soil the CBR values will improve and thickness of pavement
    layer also gets reduced. It also reduces the intensity of stress on subgrade.
    Bamboo fibers is such a geosynthetic material which is easily available, ecofriendly
    and also cost effective. With the application of soil stabilization method in
    construction the overall cost gets reduced when compared to the ordinary method
    of construction. The Highway Research Board HRB classification of the soil strata
    like black cotton soil and sedu soil is done using suitable sampling technique
    such as Core Cutter Method. To determine the characteristics like Grading by Sieve
    Analysis, Atterbergs Limits i.e Liquid limit using Cone Penetration Method and
    Casagrande Method, Plastic limit by rolling the sample to 3mm diameter thread,
    Shrinkage limit using Shrinkage apparatus, Optimum Moisture Content and Maximum
    Dry Density using Standard Proctor Test and also California Bearing Ratio by conducting
    CBR test. The pavement thickness was designed using pavement design catalogues
    published by IRC SP 20 2002. The estimation for the street is finished by considering
    the thing, for example, Earthwork Excavation for Roadway and Drains, Jungle Cutting,
    compacting and reviewing and so forth., according to SR 2016 17, PW, P and IWT
    circle Andhra Pradesh and proposing of particulars for the blend of Bamboo strands
    as Geo Synthetic material for adjustment. M. Anvesh Kumar | U. Swathi "Utilization
