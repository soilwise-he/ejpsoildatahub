  title: Large-scale Seismic Risk Assessment Integrating Nonlinear Soil Behavior and
    Soil-Structure Interaction Effects
  abstract: "The need for an accurate risk assessment procedure led to the development\
    \ of various fragility and vulnerability curves, covering a wide range of building\
    \ typologies. Nonlinear soil behavior and soil\u2013structure interaction (SSI)\
    \ efects play an essential role in this outcome; nevertheless, their infuence\
    \ is usually neglected. While for building-specifc applications, these efects\
    \ may be explicitly considered, it is currently impossible to account for such\
    \ efects in large-scale seismic risk analyses. We examine the efectiveness of\
    \ a broad set of fragility modifers (FM) that shift existing fragility curves\
    \ appropriately to consider nonlinear soil behavior and/or SSI. We apply our method\
    \ to an existing block of\u2014 mainly\u2014residential buildings in Thessaloniki,\
    \ Greece. To derive the fragility curves for the building block, we perform (i)\
    \ incremental dynamic analyses of the existing individual structures considering\
    \ nonlinear soil behavior and SSI, (ii) incremental dynamic analyses of the existing\
    \ structures neglecting the underlying soil, (iii) fragility assessment using\
    \ existing fragility curves found in literature and (iv) fragility assessment\
    \ using existing fragility curves found in literature, but modifed using our proposed\
    \ FM to account for nonlinear soil behavior and SSI. Next, assessment is also\
    \ performed in terms of vulnerability. A comparison between the obtained results\
    \ highlights the efectiveness of the proposed FM for large-scale risk assessment,\
    \ and the necessity to consider soil-related efects. In particu\u03BBar, the results\
    \ are compared in terms of fragility and vulnerability. Since the selection of\
    \ the block is representative of the city center of Thessaloniki, our results\
    \ will be indicative for city-level applications."
