  title: 'Soil mite (Acari: Oribatida) communities in the limestone quarry of Saskhori
    (Gerogia)'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;          Abstract        &lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;The present
    publication provides a review of the soil mite (Acari; Oribatida) community''s
    structure and the connection between changes in environmental factors and oribatid
    mite diversity in the limestone quarry of Saskhori and its adjacent areas. Overall,
    52 species were recorded during the study. The most abundant oribatid mite species
    were &lt;i&gt;Steganacarus carinatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aleurodamaeus setosus&lt;/i&gt;,
    &lt;i&gt;Xenillus tegeocranus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratoppia bipilis&lt;/i&gt;,
    &lt;i&gt;Oribatula tibialis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Punctoribates punctum&lt;/i&gt;.
    Interestingly, 23 species of oribatid mites were recorded for the first time from
    the limestone quarry of Saskhori, and one species (&lt;i&gt;Liacarus oribatelloides&lt;/i&gt;)
    was a new record for the Caucasus fauna. The following indices were analyzed:
    abundance (N), species diversity (S), Shannon''s diversity index (H), and Pielou''s
    evenness index (J''). Regarding the obtained results, the highest density of oribatid
    mites was recorded in the habitat with Shibliak shrubbery (332 inds/m2), while
    the forest habitat was characterized with the highest value for Shannon''s diversity
    index (2,64). In the publication, we also provide a detailed morphological description
    of the newly recorded species &lt;i&gt;L. oribatelloides&lt;/i&gt;, with the respective
    illustration, as no figures are given in its original description.&lt;/p&gt;'
