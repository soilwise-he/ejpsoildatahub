  title: Effect of soil application of ag-zyme liquid organic fertilizer on growth
    and yield of soybean (Glycine max L.)
  abstract: "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Ag-zyme liquid organic\
    \ fertilizer on growth and yield of soybean (<em>Glycine max</em> L.). The experiment\
    \ was carried out at the Teaching and Research Farm of Faculty of Agriculture\
    \ and Veterinary Medicine. The experimental was the Randomized Complete Block\
    \ Design (RCBD) with five treatments and four replications. The treatments are\
    \ 0 ml(T<sub>1</sub>), 50 ml(T<sub>2</sub>), 100 ml(T<sub>3</sub>), 150 ml (T<sub>4</sub>)\
    \ and 200 ml (T<sub>5</sub>) of Ag-zyme liquid organic fertilizer. The results\
    \ obtained showed that soil application of Ag-zyme liquid organic fertilizer at\
    \ different rates significantly (P&lt;0.05) influenced the vegetative and yield\
    \ parameters of soybean evaluated. The application of moderate levels of (T<sub>\xAD\
    2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>) Ag-zyme liquid fertilizers markedly increased the yields\
    \ (35.595 kg/ha and 29.583 kg/ha respectively) compared to other levels and control.\
    \ The result showed that the increase in vegetative, parameters, yield and yield\
    \ components were correlated to mitigation effect of application of Ag-zyme liquid\
    \ organic fertilizer during late planting in relation to harsh environmental condition."
