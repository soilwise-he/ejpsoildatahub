  title: Weight Loss Degradation Of Hybrid Blends Lldpe/Starch/Pva Upon Exposure To
    Uv Light And Soil Burial
  abstract: 'Poly bag and mulch films for agricultural field caused<br>

    pose environmental problem due to the non-degradable plastics<br>

    wastes upon disposal. Thus, a degradable poly bag was designed with<br>

    hybrid sago starch (SS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Two Different<br>

    blended compositions of SS and PVA hybrid have been compounded.<br>

    Then, the hybrids blended are mixed with linear line density<br>

    polyethylene (LLDPE) resin to fabricate poly bag film through<br>

    conventional film blowing process. Samples of LLDPE, SS and PVA<br>

    hybrid film were exposed to UV light and soil burial. The weight<br>

    losses were determined during degradation process. Hybrid film by<br>

    degradation of starch was found to hydrolyze and hydroxyl groups<br>

    decrease on esterification upon exposure to soil burial and uv<br>

    radiation. It was found out that, the hybrid film for 60% of SS<br>

    composition showed greatest degradation in soil and UV radiation.'
