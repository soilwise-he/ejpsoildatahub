  title: Biodegradable Capability of the Indigenous Micrococcus sp. Oil Degrading
    Bacteria Isolated from Oil Contaminated Soil, Motor Workshop Area of Bahror, Alwar,
    Rajasthan, India.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Crude oil contamination is one of the important issue in the
    current environment pollution. Physical, chemical and biological methods are applied
    for bioremediation. Use of microorganisms is one of the most popular methods among
    them. In this experiment, soil samples were collected from the different motor
    workshop areas to isolate potential microbes capable of crude oil degradation.
    Isolation of the crude oil degrading bacteria was followed by enriching the microorganisms
    by providing suitable growth conditions. The microorganisms those were capable
    of degrading the crude oil were identified as Bacillus spp., Pseudoxanthomonas
    spp., Phenylobacterium spp. and Micrococcus spp. by morphological and biological
    methods. Among them, biodegradation capability of Micrococcus sp. was studied
    at different oil concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;'
