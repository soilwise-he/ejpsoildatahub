  title: Numerical Analyses for the Investigation of Soil Improvement Methods in Settlement
    Issues of Spoil Materials from Lignite Mines
  abstract: 'The response of a massive heap from lignite mines'' spoils is being investigated
    when used as a foundation soil for a typical embankment. Due to the high compressibility
    of the spoil material and in order to limit large settlements, the effects of
    three soil improvement methods were analyzed: dynamic compaction, stone columns,
    and deep soil mixing using fly ash. The settlements were analyzed using 2D finite
    elements under plane strain conditions and assuming dry conditions. Two constitutive
    models were employed, the Mohr-Coulomb and the Hardening Soil.'
