  title: Systematic Review of the Literature on Various Soil Classification Methods
  abstract: Traditional methods for classifying soil have many challenges, such as
    being time-consuming, very expensive, intrusive, among <br> others. By measuring
    precise soil properties including moisture, temperature, humidity, PH, and nutrient
    content/fertility, soil monitoring and <br> Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    help improve agriculture by improving production. Then, with the help of the right
    data operations, this data <br> is collected in cloud storage, allowing us to
    improve farming tactics and produce trend analyses. This, then, allows us to precisely
    utilize <br> resources and steer our farming methods in prudent ways to optimize
    yield. In this research, we have reviewed many articles related to soil <br> classifications
    and their various methods and techniques of classification.
