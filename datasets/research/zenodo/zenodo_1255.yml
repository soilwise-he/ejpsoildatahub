  title: WATER SAVING OF RICE CROP USING INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR SOIL MANAGEMENT,
    SWMR
  abstract: "The trial was conducted in, 2019 and 2020 Kafr-El Sheikh Governorate,\
    \ Egypt, Rice (Sakha 104) was cultivated under two methods, traditional method\
    \ (WTF3) and modified innovative method in furrow bottoms, soil and water management\
    \ for rice cultivation (SWMR). The cross section of furrows is such as a zigzag\
    \ shape using a soil management and soil bed preparation (soil surface shape)\
    \ using innovative machine to soil bed preparation to harvest irrigation water.\
    \ Without any reduction of rice intensity, and rice transplants at 40 \xC3\u0192\
    \xC2\u0192\xC3\u201A\xC2\u201440 cm in both of two cultivation methods. Besides,\
    \ three treatments of nutrients (50, 75 and 100% of recommended doses and called\
    \ WMF1, WMF2 and WMF3 respectively), irrigation system are traditional system\
    \ for the first method and furrow irrigation systems for the modified innovative\
    \ method, applied water amount and nutrients was measured, productivity parameters,\
    \ economic and energy analysis. The results show that applied water in 2019 are\
    \ 13104 and 6897 m3/ ha while in 2020 are 12510 and 6724 m3/ha, for the traditional\
    \ and modified cultivation methods, Respectively. Rice yield in 2019 is 7589,\
    \ 8282, 8987 and 8580 in 2020 is 7392, 8366, 8770 and 8376 kg/ha. For both of\
    \ WMF1, WMF2, WMF3 and WTF3, respectively, finally, every parameters engaged with\
    \ irrigation water is influenced according to the water foot print of rice is\
    \ cut to half. SWMR technique can save about 20% of irrigation water will be saved\
    \ in world."
