  title: Contamination Profile of Hydrocarbons and Heavy Metals in Soil from an Artisanal
    Refining Site, K-Dere South-South Nigeria
  abstract: "soils from K-Dere artisanal refining site and Nwinua mangrove forest\
    \ Kono (control site), Ogoni Rivers State. Hydrocarbons were analysed with gas\
    \ chromatography; heavy metals were analysed using AAS. The study showed that\
    \ there were spatial, temporal and significantly statistical variations (P&lt;0.05)\
    \ of TPH, total PAHs and heavy metals between study areas. Concentration of TPH\
    \ peaked at 250,602mg/kg was found in intertidal soil sample where artisanal refining\
    \ activities are carried out against 78.00mg/kg found in the control site in Kono.\
    \ These values are well above EGASPIN target value of 1mgkg-1 in soil. The observed\
    \ concentration of PAHs at the study areas varied both temporally and spatially\
    \ in the soil samples analysed. The maximum mean PAHs concentration (68.85 \xB1\
    \ 53.59mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) and the lowest mean (8.50 \xB1 7.15mgkg<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ was recorded in August and September 2018 at the artisanal refining site while\
    \ the highest mean (21.99mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) were recorded in May 2019 at the control\
    \ site. These values are far higher than the Department of Petroleum Resources\
    \ (DPR, 2002) target value for PAHs in soil 1mgkg-1 and also higher than the limit\
    \ set by World Health Organization (WHO) (0.1mg/kg), thus raising concern of human\
    \ exposure to cancer through food chain. High levels of heavy metals Fe (219 \u2013\
    \ 13, 234mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), Pb (2.66 \xB1 0.39 \u2013 3.15 \xB1 0.45mgkg<sup>-1</sup>),\
    \ Cr (BDL \u2013 89.21mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), Zn (23.00 \u2013 111.10mgkg<sup>-1</sup>),\
    \ Cd (7.25 \xB1 1.11 \u2013 8.06 \xB1 1.21mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) were observed in\
    \ soil samples from the artisanal refining site. These values are all indicators\
    \ of pollution, and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is recommended that\
    \ crops should not be planted at areas proximate to artisanal refining site as\
    \ this may have effect on human through food chain. It is also recommended that\
    \ artisanal refining activities in the area should be discouraged to avoid further\
    \ contamination in the area. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Soil, artisanal refinery,\
