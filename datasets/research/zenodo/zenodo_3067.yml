  title: Zinc and copper availability in herbage and soil of a Pinus radiata silvopastoral
    system in Northwest Spain after sewage-sludge and lime application
  abstract: 'Silvopastoral systems are ancient farming systems in the world, consisting
    of the combination of

    a woody component (trees or shrubs) and crops and/or animals within the same land-management
    unit. In various European Union (EU) countries, the possibility of using sewage
    sludge as a fertilizer is under consideration as a viable method of disposal,
    considering the increase in sewage-sludge production in recent years and the restrictions
    imposed by European policy on the usual methods of disposal. The concern is the
    concentration of heavy metals, which can reach humans through the food chain.
    In Spain, R.D. 1310/1990, as well as European Directive 86/278, limit the total
    in-soil heavy-metal concentration, but not the solubility changes, which directly
    affect plant absorption and leaching of heavy metals throughout the soil profile.
    The objective of this experiment was to compare, in a silvopastoral system over
    a period of 3 years, the effect of applying three doses of sewage sludge combined
    with and without liming, on total and available soil Zn and Cu and their concentration
    in plants. Liming did not affectct Zn and Cu availability; however, sewage sludge
    increased Zn and Cu availability, though total in-soil Zn was increased only in
    November 2000. In-plant Zn concentration was increased by sewage sludge in the
    last 2 years of the study. In all cases, the quality of forage obtained and measured
    with regard to the concentrations of Zn and Cu was adequate for animal consumption.
    With respect to sewage-sludge application as a fertilizer, the management of heavy-metal
    availability must be included in the policy, because environmental risk could
    then be adequately evaluated.'
