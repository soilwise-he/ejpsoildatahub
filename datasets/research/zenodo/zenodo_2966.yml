  title: Influence of Method, Duration and Norms of Application of Logon Minefield
    Bentonite Mud on the Amount of Nutrients in the Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT:&nbsp;The article discusses the impact of the application
    of bentonite sludge from the Logan deposit in different methods, terms and standards
    on the nutrients in the soil in the conditions of meadow saline, moderately saline
    soils of Central Fergana.As a result of application of Logan bentonite mud under
    autumn plowing at the rate of 1.5-3.0 t / ha per year, in three years in the driving
    layer of the soil humus 0.003-0.007%, total nitrogen 0.002-0.006%, phosphorus
    0.005-0.015%, potassium 0.012-0.030 % increase and reports of improved agrochemical
    properties.&lt;/p&gt;'
