  title: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) removal from soil washing water
    by coagulation and flocculation
  abstract: "Soil washing is currently attracting attention as a promising remediation\
    \ strategy for land contaminated withper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\
    \ In the soil washing process, the contaminant is transferred from thesoil into\
    \ the liquid phase, producing a PFAS contaminated process water. One way to treat\
    \ such process water isto use coagulation and flocculation; however, few studies\
    \ are available on the performance of coagulation andflocculation for removing\
    \ PFAS from such process water. This study evaluated 6 coagulants and flocculants(polyaluminium\
    \ chloride (PACl), zirconium oxychloride octahydrate, cationic and anionic polyacrylamide,Polyclay\
    \ 685 and Perfluor Ad\xAE), for the treatment of a proxy PFAS contaminated washing\
    \ water, spiked withPFAS concentrations found at typical Aqueous Film Forming\
    \ Foam (AFFF) contaminated sites. PFAS removalefficiencies (at constant pH) varied\
    \ greatly depending on the coagulants and flocculants, as well as the dosageused\
    \ and the targeted PFAS. All tested coagulants and flocculants reduced the turbidity\
    \ by >95%, depending onthe dosage. Perfluor Ad\xAE, a specially designed coagulant,\
    \ showed the highest removal efficiency for all longerchain (>99%) and shorter\
    \ chain PFAS (>68%). The cationic polyacrylamide polymer removed longer chain\
    \ PFASup to an average of 80%, whereas average shorter chain PFAS removal was\
    \ lower (<30%). The two metal-basedcoagulants tested, PACl and zirconium, removed\
    \ longer chain PFAS by up to an average of 61% and shorter chainPFAS up to 48%.\
    \ Polyclay 685, a mixture of powdered activated carbon (PAC) and aluminium sulphate,\
    \ removedlonger chain PFAS by 90% and shorter chain PFAS on average by 76%, when\
    \ very high dosages of the coagulantwere used (2,000 mg/L). PFAS removal efficiencies\
    \ correlated with chain length and headgroup. Shorter chainPFAS removal was dependent\
    \ on electrostatic interaction with the precipitating flocs, whereas for longer\
    \ chainPFAS, hydrophobic interactions between apolar functional groups and flocs\
    \ created by the coagulant/flocculant,dissolved organic matter and suspended solids\
    \ played a major role. The results of this study showed that byselecting the most\
    \ efficient coagulant and aqueous conditions, a greater amount of PFAS can be\
    \ removed fromprocess waters in soil washing facilities, and thus included as\
    \ part of various treatment trains."
