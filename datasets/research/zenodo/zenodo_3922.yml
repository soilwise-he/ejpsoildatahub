  title: Developing Pedotransfer Functions For Estimating Some Soil Properties Using
    Artificial Neural Network And Multivariate Regression Approaches
  abstract: Study of soil properties like field capacity (F.C.) and permanent wilting
    point (P.W.P.) play important roles in study of soil moisture retention curve.
    Although these parameters can be measured directly, their measurement is difficult
    and expensive. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) provide an alternative by estimating
    soil parameters from more readily available soil data. In this investigation,
    70 soil samples were collected from different horizons of 15 soil profiles located
    in the Ziaran region, Qazvin province, Iran. The data set was divided into two
    subsets for calibration (80%) and testing (20%) of the models and their normality
    were tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Both multivariate regression and artificial
    neural network (ANN) techniques were employed to develop the appropriate PTFs
    for predicting soil parameters using easily measurable characteristics of clay,
    silt, O.C, S.P, B.D and CaCO3. The performance of the multivariate regression
    and ANN models was evaluated using an independent test data set. In order to evaluate
    the models, root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 were used. The comparison of
    RSME for two mentioned models showed that the ANN model gives better estimates
    of F.C and P.W.P than the multivariate regression model. The value of RMSE and
    R2 derived by ANN model for F.C and P.W.P were (2.35, 0.77) and (2.83, 0.72),
    respectively. The corresponding values for multivariate regression model were
    (4.46, 0.68) and (5.21, 0.64), respectively. Results showed that ANN with five
    neurons in hidden layer had better performance in predicting soil properties than
    multivariate regression.
