  title: Soil mites (Acari) of natural areas of a former military training field in
    Olsztyn (Poland)
  abstract: 'Due to restricted public access to military training fields such areas
    are quite interesting places for conducting faunistic research that would be simply
    impossible in other terrains. The area examined in the present study was the former
    military training field in Olsztyn, with the adjacent Lasek Pieczewski and the
    valley of Skanda Lake. The major aim of the study was to evaluate the current
    state of the environment in the terrain of the former military training field
    and the adjacent areas. In this study mites from the suborder Uropodina and cohort
    Labidostommatina (Acari: Mesostigmata et Prostigmata) were used as a bioindicators.
    These mites are useful for this purpose because of their specific habitat preferences.
    The community of mites in the area under scrutiny contained 23 taxa, comparing
    to 34 species found in whole voivoideship, which is 68% of local species biodiversity.
    <em>Oodinychus ovalis</em> turned out to be the most numerous species (the specimens
    of this species constituted almost 38% of the whole community and the frequency
    per sample was 55%). The other quite numerous species found in the examined area
    were <em>Janetiella pulchella</em> and <em>Oodinychus karawaiewi</em>, which constituted
    over 30% of the whole community. Taking into account the number of species and
    their habitat preferences two most valuable areas were found: southern part of
    Lasek Pieczewski and Skanda Lake valley.'
