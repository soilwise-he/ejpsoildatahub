  title: Changes In Physical And Chemical Properties Of Soil In Timber Sawmill Dumpsite
    In Abakaliki, Abakaliki Southeastern, Nigeria
  abstract: "A study to assess changes in the physical and chemical properties of\
    \ soil in timber saw mill dumpsite was carried out in Abakaliki between 2007 and\
    \ 2008. Results showed that soil textural class remained sandy loamy. The lowest\
    \ soil bulk density of 1.34 and 1.20 g cm-3 were obtained in the unburnt dumpsite\
    \ in 2007 and 2008 resulting to 12% and 20% decline in 2007 and 2008 in the unburnt\
    \ dumpsite relative to cropped land. The total porosity and gravimetric moisture\
    \ content was a reverse of the soil bulk density. Higher total porosity and gravimetric\
    \ moisture content were obtained in the unburnt and burnt dumpsites in that order\
    \ relative to the fallow and cropped land. Infiltration rate followed the same\
    \ trends as total porosity of the various sites. The lowest infiltration rate\
    \ 15.02 and 35.82 mmhr-1 was observed in the cropped land. The soil pH decreased\
    \ with depth in the dump and non-dumpsite but became strongly acid at 30 \u2013\
    \ 60 cm and 60 \u2013 90 cm depths. The order of soil organic matter content was\
    \ unburnt dumpsite &gt; burnt dumpsite &gt; fallow &gt; cropped land. The available\
    \ P and exchangeable K and Ca were highest in the burnt dumpsite. Heavy metals\
    \ (Zn, Cu, Fe, and Pb) increased with time in the burnt and unburnt dumpsites\
    \ but decreased in the cropped land. More concentration of heavy metals was observed\
    \ in the 0 \u2013 30 cm soil depth. The relative performance of maize grown on\
    \ soils of the dump and non-dumpsites showed that there was better growth in the\
    \ dump sites soils. However, the concentrations of heavy metals on tissue were\
    \ found to be within normal range. Therefore, long term dumping of sawmill waste\
    \ can influence soil properties and productivity."
