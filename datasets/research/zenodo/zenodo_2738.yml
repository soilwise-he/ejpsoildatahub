  title: Impact of bauxite mine to natural forest biomass and soil properties in Kas
    Island, Riau Island Province in Indonesia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this investigation, the impact of bauxite mine to natural
    forest biomass and soil properties in Kas Island, Riau Island Province in Indonesia
    was investigated. On the island of &nbsp;Kas, bauxite mining permits have been
    issued. Mining activities will cause the destruction of natural forests as a source
    of wood, loss of flora and fauna, water regulator and medicines, besides it will
    also cause damage to land and the environment. Reclamation activities undertaken
    aimed at improving the vegetation structure and soil characteristics that undergo
    changes due to mine. The research method used is the analysis of vegetation and
    soil sampling is done by purposive sampling. Laboratory test data from physical
    and chemical properties of the soil, were analyzed by descriptive and statistical
    tests. &nbsp;Bauxite mining activities have caused the loss of biomass of natural
    forests by 168.8 tons / ha. Revegetation activities on bauxite mining sites should
    be restored through planting trees of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pulcherrimum sp, Laplacea
    subintegerrima, Calophyllum soulatri, Thesposia populnea, Diosphyros sp, Schima
    wallichii&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hopea mangarawan&lt;/em&gt;. Bauxite
    mining activities cause changes in soil properties, namely a significant increase
    in bulk density of 0.55 (76.39%) and a significant decrease in porosity of 22.39
    (30.21%), drainage pore of 6.57 (52.77%), water available at 6.41 (36.59 %), permeability
    is 19.59 (82.69%), C-organic is 12.20 (93.99%), N&nbsp; is 0.47 (85.45%), and
    P&nbsp; is 29.88 (85.91%). Therefore, bauxite mine activity leads to significant
    changes in physical properties and soil chemistry properties for bulk density
    parameters, porosity, drainage pores, available water, and permeability, C-organic,
    nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
