  title: Performance assessment of amended laterite soil as liner material in ash
    pond structures

    \ <em>Manuscript received online 02 February 2019, accepted 14 March 2019</em>\
    \ The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of locally available\
    \ laterite soil (LS) as primary liner material in ash ponds to restrict subsurface\
    \ migration of heavy metals such as Cd, Ni, and Zn etc. present in the leachate\
    \ generated from ash ponds of Thermal Power Plants. Due to its high permeability\
    \ (3.74\xD710<sup>\u20135</sup> cm/s) and moderate shear strength, laterite soil\
    \ was further amended with commercially procured bentonite (B) and fly ash (FA)\
    \ in the ratio of 8(LS):1(B):1(FA) to enhance its contaminants attenuating potential\
    \ as liner material. The metal removal efficiency of the amended laterite soil\
    \ was observed around 96% in case of cadmium metal. The results of fixed bed column\
    \ experiment exhibit excellent heavy metal adsorption potential of amended laterite\
    \ soil. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) generated by using HYDRUS-1D solute transport\
    \ software shows good fitting with experimentally observed data."
