  title: Developing Expert System for Soil Stabilization under Flexible Pavement
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Experts are, generally, busy and few in number. Getting them
    to work any time and in several locations is difficult, if not impossible, and
    requires time, cost and stress. Soil stabilization and modification represent
    an excellent domain for the development of an expert system, which contains a
    knowledge base of heuristic rules about types and remedies of stabilization. Thus,
    an Expert system program is a suitable solution together with the all the unpublished
    knowledge of the experts and combine it into a single accessible program, which
    could come in handy whenever a novice, student or practitioner engineer need it.
    The knowledge is extracted from literatures, questionnaire form and interviews
    with senior pavement engineers (expert), who have long expertise in flexible pavement
    engineering, especially in stabilization. The knowledge is then represented in
    knowledge base and encodes to be suitably entered in expert system builder shell
    (ES BUILDER). The system after being developed is have then to be evaluated by
    the experts and the users, to evaluate its efficiency and to recommend improvements
    and offer suggestions to improve the user interface. The overall commands after
    the evaluation stated that the software was very favorable. The users were very
    impressed by the system and it&#39;s efficient and solutions for the soil stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;'
