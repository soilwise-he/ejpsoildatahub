  title: Distribution and plant availability of Cd, Pb, Cu and As in different particlesize
    soil fractions
  abstract: "Institute of Environmental Engineering, School of Metallurgy and Environment,\
    \ Central South University, Changsha 410083, China <em>E-mail</em> : banerjeesme@csu.edu.cn,\
    \ banerjeeenvsc@gmail.com <em>Manuscript received 06 July 2017, accepted 08 August\
    \ 2017</em> The present study was conducted to evaluate the distribution and plant\
    \ availability of Cd, Pb, Cu and As in different particle-size soil fractions.\
    \ The distribution of total heavy metals and their plant availability were investigated\
    \ in a metal mining area in the Hunan Province, China. Soils were partitioned\
    \ into five particle-size fractions : coarse sand (&gt; 500 \xB5m), medium sand\
    \ (125\u2013500 \xB5m), fine sand (50\u2013125 \xB5m), silt (2\u201350 \xB5m)\
    \ and clay (&lt;2 \xB5m). The most dominant elements in all size fractions at\
    \ all sites are Pb and Cu followed by Cd and As. The concentration of heavy metals\
    \ and metalloid in the studied soils ranged between 718\u2013936 mg/kg : Pb, 9.625\u2013\
    28.352 mg/kg : Cd, 92\u2013142 mg/kg : Cu and 42.882\u201374.862 mg/kg : As. Concentrations\
    \ of plant available Pb (42.964\u2013141.968 mg/kg), Cd (2.846\u201311.273 mg/kg),\
    \ Cu (15.932\u201321.857 mg/kg)and As (6.954\u20139.251 mg/kg) in the soils were\
    \ higher in the clay fraction (Pb&gt;Cu&gt;As. Cd showed a high environmental\
    \ risk with the RAC value for the clay (18.216\u201339.761%) and silt (18.904\u2013\
    36.181%) of the studied soil could be considered to be dangerous to surrounding\
    \ soil ecosystem. The study reflected the relative importance of the particle\
    \ size fractions with respect to their contribution to metal availability. The\
    \ study also revealed that the Cd, Pb, Cu and As were characteristically enriched\
    \ in the fine clay particles due to higher surface area and the compositional\
    \ characteristics of the fine particles."
