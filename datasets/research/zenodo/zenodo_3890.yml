  title: Discount Rate Water Absorption Plant Fibers / Treatment of Physical Rice
    Straw by Dumping in Soil Solutions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rice straw (agricultural waste) was included in
    the construction of homes in Africa. This application is still useful since it
    improves some physical properties of materials. However, the great absorption
    of water of such fibers constitutes an obstacle to the hydration of cement. To
    remedy this we offer a fiber processing technique. This technique using soil reduces
    from 15 to 33% absorption rate of rice straw. The processing performance depends
    on the soil used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
