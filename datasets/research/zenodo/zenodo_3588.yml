  title: Experimental study on lateral moisture migration of soil under artificial
    freezing conditions
  abstract: "Abstract In this paper, the pollution clays under different freezing\
    \ temperatures were studied by artificial freezing tests, and the power consumption,\
    \ the amount of liquid recharging during freezing, the amount of liquid recharging\
    \ during freezing, and the variation rules of the temperature field and water\
    \ field during freezing were obtained. And we get the following conclusion: (1)\
    \ The temperature of the part within 5cm of the frozen plate decreases rapidly\
    \ and greatly, with a temperature decrease of 31.1\u2103 and a negative temperature\
    \ value, while the temperature of the part far from the frozen plate decreases\
    \ slowly and with a small amplitude, which can be generally divided into the rapid\
    \ cooling stage, slow cooling stage and overall stability stage. (2) Within 10cm\
    \ of the frozen plate, most of the water in the soil samples exists in the form\
    \ of ice crystals, and its volumetric water content decreases by 13.63%. In the\
    \ range beyond 10cm of the frozen plate, with the increase of the distance between\
    \ the TDR moisture collector and the frozen plate, the decrease of water content\
    \ becomes smaller and smaller, and the volumetric water content at the furthest\
    \ distance from the frozen plate decreases by 1.2%. (3) In the static state, after\
    \ the saturated water replenishment process of 483h, the total water replenishment\
    \ inside the soil tank is 22.9L; Under freezing conditions, after 423h freezing\
    \ water replenishment process, the total water replenishment inside the soil tank\
    \ is 30.23L. By studying the water migration of soil under freezing conditions,\
    \ the water can enter into the soil and contact the soil to a greater extent,\
    \ to make a basic analysis for the restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil\
    \ by the freeze-thaw leaching method."
