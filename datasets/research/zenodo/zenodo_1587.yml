  title: Coffee pulp compost A viable organic source of nutrients for Soil and Crops
  abstract: The principles behind composting are specific enzyme production systems
    of microbes, which can degrade the complex organic debris into simpler substances
    that crops can utilize as nutrient sources. Coffee pulp is the major residue during
    the recovery of parchment coffee beans which is left unutilized. This can be converted
    into utilizable organic manure without endangering the environment by employing
    potential microbial agents and earthworms. Farmers of the plain region popularly
    adopt these technologies to produce organic manures from crop residues for sustainable
    production. Generally, these technologies are less popularized in hill regions
    due to a lack of knowledge on the decomposition of coffee pulp waste, available
    microbial decomposition methods and negligence of the importance of the nutritional
    value of coffee pulp into nutrient rich manure. Hence, the knowledge of composting
    coffee pulp waste through various composting technologies is essential for the
    farmers to recycle the wastes into organic manure, which enriches soil nutrients
    and utilizing in organic farming
