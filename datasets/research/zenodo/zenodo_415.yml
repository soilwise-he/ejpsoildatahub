  title: "Phytoassessment of Vetiver grass enhanced with EDTA soil amendment grown\
    \ in single and mixed heavy metal\xE2\u20AC\u201Ccontaminated soil"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Over the years, ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetate (EDTA) has been
    widely used for many purposes. However, there are inadequate phytoassessment studies
    conducted using EDTA in Vetiver grass. Hence, this study evaluates the phytoassessment
    (growth performance, accumulation trends, and proficiency of metal uptake) of
    Vetiver grass,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Vetiveria zizanioides&lt;/em&gt;(Linn.) Nash in
    both single and mixed heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn)&mdash;disodium EDTA-enhanced
    contaminated soil. The plant growth, metal accumulation, and overall efficiency
    of metal uptake by different plant parts (lower root, upper root, lower tiller,
    and upper tiller) were thoroughly examined. The relative growth performance, metal
    tolerance, and phytoassessment of heavy metal in roots and tillers of Vetiver
    grass were examined. Metals in plants were measured using the flame atomic absorption
    spectrometry (F-AAS) after acid digestion. The root-tiller (R/T) ratio, biological
    concentration factor (BCF), biological accumulation coefficient (BAC), tolerance
    index (TI), translocation factor (TF), and metal uptake efficacy were used to
    estimate the potential of metal accumulation and translocation in Vetiver grass.
    All accumulation of heavy metals were significantly higher (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;
    0.05) in both lower and upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass for Cd + Pb +
    Cu + Zn + EDTA treatments as compared with the control. The single Zn + EDTA treatment
    accumulated the highest overall total amount of Zn (8068 &plusmn; 407 mg/kg) while
    the highest accumulation for Cu (1977 &plusmn; 293 mg/kg) and Pb (1096 &plusmn;
    75 mg/kg) were recorded in the mixed Cd + Pb + Cu + Zn + EDTA treatment, respectively.
    Generally, the overall heavy metal accumulation trends of Vetiver grass were in
    the order of Zn &gt;&gt;&gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt;&gt; Cd for all treatments. Furthermore,
    both upper roots and tillers of Vetiver grass recorded high tendency of accumulation
    for appreciably greater amounts of all heavy metals, regardless of single and/or
    mixed metal treatments. Thus, Vetiver grass can be recommended as a potential
    phytoextractor for all types of heavy metals, whereby its tillers will act as
    the sink for heavy metal accumulation in the presence of EDTA for all treatments.&lt;/p&gt;'
