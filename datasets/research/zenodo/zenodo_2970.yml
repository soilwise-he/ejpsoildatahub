  title: Application of pollution assessment models in soil contaminated by heavy
    metals in two steel rods markets, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-30cm within two steel markets\
    \ and a control site in Port Harcourt, Rivers State Nigeria to assess the level\
    \ of heavy metals (Fe, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni and As) in the environment. Atomic Adsorption\
    \ Spectrophotometer was used to analyze the samples for heavy metals. The concentrations\
    \ of all the heavy metals in the steel rods markets exceeded that of the control.\
    \ The results indicated that heavy metals concentrations in the sites were in\
    \ the order; Mile III &gt; Kala &gt; RSU. The average levels of contamination\
    \ of heavy metals recorded followed the order Fe &gt; Cr &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt;\
    \ Ni &gt; As &gt; Cd in Mile III, Fe &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cr &gt; Ni &gt; As &gt;\
    \ Cd in Kala and Fe &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Cr &gt; Ni &gt; As &gt; Cd in RSU (control).\
    \ Mean concentrations obtained for heavy metals within the months of investigation\
    \ were; 1420.931\xB19.155, 7.753\xB10.184, 8.730\xB10.050, 2.843\xB10.124, 9.428\xB1\
    0.122, 7.433\xB10.047 and 3.732\xB10.047 mg/Kg for Fe, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni and\
    \ As respectively at the mile III station, while the mean concentrations of heavy\
    \ metals observed at the Kala station were; 1161.173\xB11.823, 9.425\xB10.054,\
    \ 7.596\xB10.027, 1.425\xB10.020, 6.507\xB10.006, 5.455\xB10.033 and 1.901\xB1\
    0.010 mg/Kg for Fe, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni and As respectively. The mean values of\
    \ heavy metals concentrations observed at the RSU station within the period were;\
    \ 892.064\xB11.025,5.603\xB10.007, 5.841\xB10.051, 0.173\xB10.005, 3.389\xB10.009,\
    \ 2.309\xB10.010 and 0.706\xB10.006 mg/Kg for Fe, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni and As respectively.\
    \ Pollution assessment models used for assessing the anthropogenic input on the\
    \ quality of the soil in the area using the control site as the basis of judgment\
    \ were: contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), contamination degree\
    \ (CD), modified contamination degree (mCD), potential ecological risk coefficient\
    \ (Eir), potential ecological risk index (RI), Geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and\
    \ anthropogenicity. These indices revealed that the steel markets were contaminated\
    \ and polluted and poses ecological risks by heavy metals, even though the values\
    \ obtained were still below the WHO acceptable limits. The steel rods markets\
    \ need to be adequately monitored and regulated to avoid further soil contamination\
    \ by heavy metals to a degree that will be dangerous to human health."
