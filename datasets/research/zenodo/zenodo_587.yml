  title: Effect of Lime on Engineering Properties of Cohesive Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is a unique natural material and the properties of soils
    can be altered by adding stabilizing agents such as lime. Lime is the oldest traditional
    stabilizer used for soil stabilization. Lime is one of the several products that
    can be used in the improvement of the engineering characteristics of soils. This
    research presents the effect of lime on engineering properties of cohesive soil.
    In order to identify and classify this soil, at first physical properties of soil
    are determined. And then, mechanical property tests are conducted. Next, lime
    is added to natural soils. Lime contents are selected as 4 , 6 and 8 by weight
    of natural soils. The plasticity index decrease with increasing the percentage
    of lime content. Soil is mixed with selected lime contents at their maximum dry
    density. In cohesive soil, the more the lime content, the more the cohesion. The
    lowest value of cohesion is 0.59 kg cm2 at lime 4 and it increases according to
    lime content. The percentage of lime increased, CBR value is also increased. Nyein
