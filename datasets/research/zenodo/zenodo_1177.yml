  title: 'Researches of soil laccases in the 21st century: main directions and prospects'
  abstract: 'Laccases (benzodiol: oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) belong to the
    so-called blue-copper oxidase family and are coppercontaining enzymes that are
    involved in oxidative processes by catalyzing the oxidation of various compounds
    with molecular oxygen, including o- and w-diphenols, aminophenols, polyphenols,
    polyamines, aryl diamines, phenolic substructures of lignin, and also some inorganic
    ions. The physiological functions of laccases are diverse: participation in the
    formation of pigments and the formation of fruiting bodies of fungi, detoxification
    of phenols, catalysis of the oxidation of non-phenolic lignin units (C<sub>4</sub>-esterified)
    to radicals. Laccase activity increases due to the introduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup>,
    Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, but is strongly inhibited by Fe<sup>2+</sup>,
    Ag<sup>+</sup>, l-cysteine, dithiothreitol and NaN<sub>3</sub>. In the lower soil
    layers, the activity of laccase shows a significant increase when supplied with
    mineral N, the addition of compost leads to increased activity in the surface
    layer. The prospects for the practical use of oxidases increased after the discovery
    of the possibility of enhancing their action using redox mediators, which are
    substrates of these enzymes, during the oxidation of which highly redox potential
    and chemically active products are formed. Biocatalytic systems created by nano-technologies
    (bacterial nanocellulose, carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoflowers etc.) increase
    the reaction efficiency by increasing the surface area and loading capacity, and
    reducing the mass transfer resistance. The effectiveness of immobilization is
    highly dependent on the process conditions, the properties of the enzyme and the
    material of the carrier. In particular, a clear correlation was established between
    the redox potential of the substrate and the efficiency of homogeneous catalysis.
    Of particular note is the effect of laccase on soil emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>
    and other greenhouse gases. Participating in the polymerization of soluble phenols,
    they thereby contribute to humification, forming stable humic fractions that bind
    soil carbon. The data presented indicate that soil laccase is an important factor
    in the functionality of soil, but they need to be studied in more detail in order
    to understand the mechanisms that regulate their activity.'
