  title: Mobility and Distribution of Some Selected Trace Metals in Soil from Dumpsite
    in Lafia, Nasarawa State
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mobility and distribution of some selected trace metal was carried
    out using Tessier et al 1979sequential extraction method and the results obtained
    shows from dumpsite A, samples taken from 0 - 5cm the result ranges from 0.56
    - 21.56 , 0.34 - 40.66 , 1.34 - 29.18 , 0.06 to 45.91 and 0.37 - 12.95 for the
    exchangeable, Fe - Mn oxide, organic carbonate and residual fractions respectively.
    For the samples taken from 10 - 15cm at dumpsite A, the results of the fractions
    are 0.42 - 13.63 , 0.03 - 18.48 , 1.01 - 25.34 , 0.03 - 35.19 and 0.27 - 9.31
    for exchangeable, Fe - Mn oxide, organic, carbonate and residual fractions. The
    results of dumpsite Bare 0.48 27.36 , 0.28 40.07 , 2.93 31.15 , 3.87 42.50 and
    0.84 30.67 for exchangeable, Fe Mn oxide, Organic, carbonate and residual fractions
    for sample taken from 0 5cm while for samples taken from 10 - 15cm the results
    show 0.32 - 36.38 , 0.23 - 16.49 , 0.53 - 15.83 , 1.53 - 34.88 and 0.04 - 5.27
    for exchangeable Fe - Mn oxide, carbonate and residual fractions respectively.
    The dumpsite C has the concentration of the various fractions ranging from 0.25
    - 18.34 , 2.73 to 15.58, 4.02 - 23.28 , 0.07 - 45.25 and 1.57 - 37.43 for exchangeable,
    Fe - Mn oxide, organic, carbonate and residual for samples taken from 0 - 5cm
    while for samples taken between 10 - 15cm the concentrations are 0.42 - 12 .62
    0.80 - 11.59 , 2.16 - 17.33 , 9.86 - 34.48 and 0.99 - 32.99 respectively. Gube-Ibrahim
