  title: Preliminary Design Of Frozen Soil Simulation System Based On Finite Element
    Simulation
  abstract: 'Full - Scale Accelerated Loading System, one part of

    "the Eleventh - Five - Year National Grand Technology Infrastructure

    Program" is a facility to evaluate the performance and service life of

    different kinds of pavements subjected to traffic loading under full -

    controlled environment. While simulating the environments of frigid

    zone and permafrost zone, the accurate control of air temperature, road

    temperature and roadbed temperature are the key points and also

    aporias for the designment. In this paper, numerical simulations are

    used to determine the design parameters of the frozen soil simulation

    system. At first, a brief introduction of the Full - Scale Accelerate

    Loading System was given. Then, the temperature control method of

    frozen soil simulation system was proposed. Finally, by using finite

    element simulations, the optimal design of frozen soil simulation

    system was obtained. This proposed design, which was obtained by

    finite element simulations, provided significant referents to the

    ultimate design of the environment simulation system.'
