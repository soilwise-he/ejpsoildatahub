  title: Isolation, characterisation and biocontrol potential of Trichoderma sp. isolated
    from rhizospheric soil of tomato
  abstract: "Abstract: Trichoderma is a cosmopolitan fungus that represents efficient\
    \ antagonistic and plant growth promoting activity. Tomato is one of the most\
    \ important and common horticulture crops which is highly rich in vitamins. The\
    \ crop is attacked by different types of pest and pathogens. Ralstonia solanacearum\
    \ and Botrytis cinerea are two important bacterial and fungal pathogen of tomato.\
    \ In the present study, Trichoderma sp. was isolated from rhizospheric soil of\
    \ healthy tomato plant. The identification was made on the basis of morphological\
    \ characteristic. Dual culture assay of Trichoderma against Ralstonia solanacearum\
    \ and Botrytis cinerea was performed in vitro. Trichoderma sp. exhibited the highest\
    \ mycelial inhibition rate (64.25 %) against Botrytis cinerea. The growth of Ralstonia\
    \ solanacearum was also inhibited. The fungus also showed good plant growth promoting\
    \ (PGP) activity. Positive results were obtained for protease, cellulase, siderophore\
    \ and IAA production. In vitro tests against plant\_ phytopathogens indicate that\
    \ the isolated strain of Trichoderma sp. is a promising option for development\
    \ of biocontrol agent.\n\nKeywords: Trichoderma, tomato, phytopathogens, in vitro\
    \ assay, biocontrol, plantgrowth promotion"
