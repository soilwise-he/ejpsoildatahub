  title: Morphological and agrochemical soil characteristics of different types of
    landscapes of Dendropark Trostjanets of the NAS of Ukraine
  abstract: "The results of studies of soils in Dendrological Park Trostjanets, which\
    \ was carried out by Cherkasy branch of the Ukrainian State Institution of Orchards\
    \ and Vineyards \u201CUkrhiprosad\u201D in 1982 and our studies in 2013 are given.\
    \ The samples for analysis were taken from 151 sections of 70 to 300 cm depth.\
    \ We found on the territory of the park the following soils: black leached silty-sandy\
    \ (118.32 ha), typical black with low content of humus silty-sandy (4.15 ha),\
    \ typical black powerful with low content of humus silty-sandy (52.36 ha), meadow\
    \ black silty-sandy (3.51 ha), medow-swamp silty-sandy (1.75 ha), reclaimed silty-sandy\
    \ (8.48 ha). The reaction of soil solution is neutral, weak alkaline reaction\
    \ (pH saline \u2013 7.8) has reclaimed soil only. The morphological and agrochemical\
    \ characteristics of park soils are presented. We describe each type of soil in\
    \ texture and chemical composition. The results obtained show that heavy metals\
    \ content in soil (cadmium, lead, copper, zinc) does not exceed the permissible\
    \ level."
