  title: The Challenges Emanating from Soil Utilization Practices and the Levels of
    Conservation Education and Awareness Among Rural Farmers in Nigeria.
  abstract: 'Sustainable Development is the utilization of resources to ensure the
    creation of<br>

    materials and/or facilities/ devices that improve the well-being of man and his
    habitat in such<br>

    a way and manner that the resources continue to be available for exploitation
    over a long<br>

    period of time. However, many interacting factors of both nature and human activities<br>

    continue to constitute great obstacles in the realization of the goal. This paper
    is aimed at<br>

    adding to the awareness campaign in the aspects of soil utilization practices
    and the level of<br>

    conservation awareness amongst our rural farmers who are responsible for over
    70 % of local<br>

    arable field crops produce. This work is an original scholarly research/ inquiry
    based on<br>

    review of related pedagogic and didactic materials as well as observations in
    visits to farming<br>

    communities. The results reveal soil degrading practices and low level of conservation<br>

    awareness resulting from poor education (literally and practically) by government
    and /or<br>

    private agencies occupied with sustainable development drive. The paper ends with
    useful<br>

    suggestions that can impact positively on the awareness level and better practices
    by the rural<br>

    farmers.'
