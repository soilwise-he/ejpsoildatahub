  title: Analysis of actual loads in soil cultivation machines
  abstract: In solving the problems of further development of the agricultural sector
    of our country an important place is occupied by issues of increasing agricultural
    production. Therefore, recently attention is paid to the problems of agricultural
    engineering. New samples are made and machines for tillage are reconstructed,
    measures are taken to increase the capacity and expand the technological capabilities
    of factories - manufacturers of agricultural equipment. As a result, domestic
    farmers are equipped with modern machines, designed and manufactured new models
    of high-performance equipment. High productivity of tillage machines is achieved
    mainly due to the increase in tillage speeds, width of the soil, etc. This leads
    to a significant increase in the power parameters of the drives and, as a consequence,
    to the high voltage of all elements of transmissions and working bodies. Recently,
    the stresses in the transmissions when calculating the contact endurance using
    a range of constant technological loads have increased by 30%, and the resistance
    to fatigue wear of the teeth - by more than 50%. And although machine builders
    have managed to increase the level of allowable stresses by about the same amount
    during this period and thus seem to compensate for the growth of such design stresses,
    spare parts costs have more than doubled in recent years, the number of failures
    has doubled. The growth of agricultural production and supply of spare parts for
    new equipment is outpacing the growth of production of the equipment itself. One
    of the main reasons for this unfavorable situation is that the quantitative growth
    of energy parameters of new equipment has led to qualitatively new problems in
    the creation of agricultural equipment, to solve which the design practice was
    unprepared. Agricultural machine builders have encountered a significant increase
    in tillage machines for non-technological loads that exceed the established technological
    ones. The creation of workable machines for tillage under conditions of intensive
    loads has become an acute problem, the solution of which largely depends on the
    technical and economic indicators of new and reconstructed machines.
