  title: Dimensional Analysis of SDOF Systems Rocking on Inelastic Soil
  abstract: "Aiming to derive results of generalized applicability and provide a generalization\
    \ framework for future research on the subject, this article performs a dimensional\
    \ analysis of SDOF systems rocking on compliant soil, taking account of soil inelasticity,\
    \ foundation uplifting, and P\u2013\u03B4 effects. The effectiveness of the proposed\
    \ formulation, under static and dynamic conditions, is verified through numerical\
    \ analyses of self-similar \u201Cequivalent\u201D systems. Then, a parametric\
    \ study is conducted to gain further insights on the key factors affecting the\
    \ performance, with emphasis on metaplastic ductility and toppling rotation. It\
    \ is shown that P\u2013\u03B4 effects may lead to a substantial reduction of (monotonic)\
    \ moment capacity, especially in the case of slender and heavily loaded structures.\
    \ Interestingly, this reduction in moment capacity is compensated (to some extent)\
    \ by an overstrength that develops during cyclic loading. Asymmetric (near-field)\
    \ seismic excitations tend to produce larger maximum and permanent rotation, compared\
    \ to symmetric multi-cycle (far-field) excitations, which are critical in terms\
    \ of settlement. The dimensionless toppling rotation \u03B8 ult /\u03B8 c (where\
    \ \u03B8 c is the toppling rotation of the equivalent rigid block) is shown to\
    \ be a function of the factor of safety against vertical loads FS v and the slenderness\
    \ ratio h/B. In the case of lightly loaded systems (FS v \u2192 \u221E), soil\
    \ plastification is limited and the metaplastic response approaches that of the\
    \ equivalent rigid block : \u03B8 ult /\u03B8 c \u2192 1. The toppling rotation\
    \ \u03B8 ult /\u03B8c is shown to decrease with FS v : \u03B8 ult /\u03B8 c \u2192\
    \ 0 for FS v \u2192 1. The role of the h/B becomes increasingly important when\
    \ the response is governed by soil nonlinearity (FS v \u2192 1). Finally, an approximate\
    \ simplified \u201Cempirical\u201D equation is proposed, correlating \u03B8 ult\
    \ /\u03B8 c with h/B and FS v"
