  title: "Prediction of soil sorption coefficients with a conductor\u2010like screening\
    \ model for real solvents"
  abstract: "Using a general theory for partition coefficients based on a quantum\
    \ chemically derived conductor-like screening model for real solvents \u03C3-moment\
    \ descriptors, the logarithmic soil sorption coefficients log KOC of a database\
    \ of 440 compounds has been successfully correlated, achieving a standard deviation\
    \ (root-means-squared [RMS]) of 0.62 log-units on the training set and a predictive\
    \ RMS of 0.72 log-units on a more demanding test set. The quality of this generally\
    \ applicable predictive approach is almost the same as that of a regression of\
    \ log KOC with experimental log KOW values, which are the best correlations currently\
    \ available. The error of this new predictive method is only approximately 43%\
    \ of the error of a recently published model using a different quantum chemically\
    \ based approach."
