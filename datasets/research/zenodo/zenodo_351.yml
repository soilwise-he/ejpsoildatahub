  title: CHARACTERISTICS OF HYGIENIC SURVEILLANCE OF SOIL QUALITY
  abstract: <strong>Objectives.</strong> From the point of view of the technogenic
    impact, due to human activity, the soil is the most affected, compared to other
    components of nature. The danger of soil pollution is determined by the level
    of its possible negative effect on the contact media (water, air), food and, directly
    or indirectly, on the health of the population, as well as on the biological activity
    of the soil and self-cleaning processes. The aim of the study was the hygienic
    evaluation of soil quality indices in the localities of the Republic of Moldova
    and estimation of the effectiveness of the surveillance system of the studied
    field. <strong>Materials and methods.</strong> As object of the study in the current
    paper served the qualitative and quantitative data of the hygienic surveillance
    of soil quality, in the localities of the Republic of Moldova, for the period
    2014-2019. The current study applied hygienic, sanitary-chemical, analytical and
    statistical investigation methods (calculation of relative and average indicators,
    determination of the trend and approximate confidence value used). <strong>Results
    and discussions.</strong> The share of non-compliancy of soil quality to chemical,
    microbiological and helminth parameters, for the evaluated period, was on average,
    4,11%, 23,4% and 9,32%, respectively. For the period of 2014-2019, there is an
    increase in non-compliant soil samples to microbiological parameters, on average
    annually by 3,7% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80). The percentage of soil samples that did
    not correspond to current hygienic regulations, regarding the presence of helminth
    eggs, shows a decrease for the estimated period, on average annually by 2,46%
    (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89). The percentage of soil samples, which did not correspond
    to the hygienic regulations in force regarding the presence of helminth eggs,
    shows a decrease for the estimated period, on average annually by 2.46% (R<sup>2</sup>
    = 0.89). It should be noted that the number of soil samples investigated for chemical,
    microbiological parameters and the presence of helminth eggs, in the estimated
    period, decreased significantly. <strong>Conclusion. </strong>Hygienic surveillance
    of the soil in localities, plays an important role in ensuring the sanitary and
    epidemiological well-being of the population.
