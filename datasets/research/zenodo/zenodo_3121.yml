  title: Indexation of Soil Physico-Chemical Parameters and Fertility Status of Soils
    of D.G. Khan, South Punjab (Pakistan) in the Light of Climate Change Scenario
  abstract: Ever increasing population and urbanization are the major threat to food
    security. Therefore, it is inevitable to use the scarce resources in an efficient
    manner. Further the application of different fertilizers prior considering the
    actual prevailing fertility status of soil and the nutrients requirements of upcoming
    crops may result permanent soil health issues. In order to meet the food needs
    of the nation we shall have to enhance the yield per unit area. Hence, a survey
    was conducted for the evaluation of the fertility status of Dera Ghazi Khan for
    the execution of recommendations regarding balanced use of fertilizers. Previous
    five years soil analysis data of 45 villages of Dera Ghazi Khan exhibited the
    average pH of 8.12, Electrical conductivity of 4.23 dSm-1, about 99.3% soils were
    low in organic matter (&lt;0.86%), and 07% soil have medium range of Organic matter
    (0.867 to 1.29), 81.5, 15.5% and 3% soils were found in poor, medium and adequate
    quantity with respect to available phosphorus. About 36.9%, 28.1% and 35% soils
    were found in poor, medium and adequate range of available potassium. The results
    indicated that the majority of the soil of Dera Ghazi Khan District was found
    to be normal and is good for the growth of different crops.
