  title: Plants Cover Effects On Overland Flow And On Soil Erosion Under Simulated
    Rainfall Intensity
  abstract: "The purpose of this article is to study the effects of<br>\nplants cover\
    \ on overland flow and, therefore, its influences on the<br>\namount of eroded\
    \ and transported soil. In this investigation, all the<br>\nexperiments were conducted\
    \ in the LEGHYD laboratory using a<br>\nrainfall simulator and a soil tray. The\
    \ experiments were conducted<br>\nusing an experimental plot (soil tray) which\
    \ is 2m long, 0.5 m wide<br>\nand 0.15 m deep. The soil used is an agricultural\
    \ sandy soil (62,08%<br>\ncoarse sand, 19,14% fine sand, 11,57% silt and 7,21%\
    \ clay). Plastic<br>\nrods (4 mm in diameter) were used to simulate the plants\
    \ at different<br>\ndensities: 0 stem/m2 (bared soil), 126 stems/m\xB2, 203 stems/m\xB2\
    , 461<br>\nstems/m\xB2 and 2500 stems/m\xB2). The used rainfall intensity is 73mm/h<br>\n\
    and the soil tray slope is fixed to 3\xB0. The results have shown that the<br>\n\
    overland flow velocities decreased with increasing stems density, and<br>\nthe\
    \ density cover has a great effect on sediment concentration.<br>\nDarcy\u2013\
    Weisbach and Manning friction coefficients of overland flow<br>\nincreased when\
    \ the stems density increased. Froude and Reynolds<br>\nnumbers decreased with\
    \ increasing stems density and, consequently,<br>\nthe flow regime of all treatments\
    \ was laminar and subcritical. From<br>\nthese findings, we conclude that increasing\
    \ the plants cover can<br>\nefficiently reduce soil loss and avoid denuding the\
    \ roots plants."
