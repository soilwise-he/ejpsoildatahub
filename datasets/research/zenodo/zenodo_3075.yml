  title: Carbon, Nitrogen and Sulphur Mineralisation in a Soil from Three Decomposing
    Plant Materials of Varying C/N, C /S and N/S Ratios
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Vlswa Vidyalaya, Kalyani, West Bengal<br> <em>Manuscript received 17\
    \ December 1980, revised 17 August 1981, accepted 10 December 1981</em> A laboratory\
    \ incubation study was undertaken to compare the carbon, nitrogen and sulphur\
    \ mineralisation in a soil from three decomposing plant materials, namely, dhaincha\
    \ (\\(Sesbania\\) \\(aculeata\\)), cowpea (\\(Vigna\\) \\(sinenns\\)) and waler-hyacinth\
    \ (\\(Eichorna\\) \\(crasspipes\\)) of varying C/N, C/S and N/S ratios applied\
    \ at five different levels. Both carbon and nitrogen mineralisation from three\
    \ different plant materials followed the order : dhaincha\u2265cowpea\u2265water-hyaeinth.\
    \ The extent of carbon mineralisation was found to be a reflection of the organic\
    \ carbon content of tbe added organic matter. C/N ratio of the added plant material\
    \ predominantly controls nitrogen mineralisation in soil. While sulphur mineralisation\
    \ was found not only to depend on the sulphur content of the added plant material\
    \ but also to their composition in relation to organic carbon and total nitrogen."
