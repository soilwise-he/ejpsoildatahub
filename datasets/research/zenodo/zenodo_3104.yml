  title: Germination and seedling growth of Moringa oleifera, Moringa stenopetala
    and Phaseolus vulgaris grown in polluted soil amended with coal fly ash | IJAAR
    2022
  abstract: 'A germination test was carried out to identify plants that can germinate
    and survive in polluted soil (with and without ash) collected 2.5km east and 2.5km
    west, 20km west and 55km west (control) of the BCL Cu/Ni mine smelter in Selebi-Phikwe,
    Botswana. The experiment was carried out using <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>, <em>Moringa
    oleifera</em> and <em>Moringa stenopetala</em>. Soil acidity and heavy metal stress
    reduced germination percentage, coefficient rate of germination, root and shoot
    growth and dry weight, root: shoot, vigor index, and tolerance index of all species<em>.</em>
    Percentage reduction followed the order 2.5km west &lt; 20km west &lt; 2.5km east
    &lt; 55km west. <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>, <em>Moringa oleifera</em>, and <em>Moringa
    stenopetala</em> germinated in all soils. Their ability to germinate in polluted
    soil indicates tolerance to heavy metal and soil acidity stress and so they have
    the potential for use in phytoremediation of polluted soils around the mine. <em>Phaseolus
    vulgaris</em> had the highest overall germination performance but there was no
    significant difference between the <em>Moringa</em>s. Application of coal fly
    ash increased all the germination parameters and so coal fly ash has the potential
    for use in amending polluted soil around the mine for phytoremediation purposes.
