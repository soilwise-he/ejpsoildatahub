  title: ANALYSIS OF PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF SOIL FROM TEROGVUNYU VILLAGE AND
    HENBENJI VILLAGE UNDER TSEMINYU DISTRICT, NAGALAND
  abstract: <pre>To know the fertility status of soil, its Physico-chemical parameters
    was investigated through chemical analysis. Soil samples from two locations Terogvunyu
    village and Henbenji villages of Tseminyu district of Nagaland, India were collected
    to determine various parameters. Results obtained by analysis shows that pH of
    soil samples were less than 7 which indicates that the soil samples are in the
    range of slightly acidic to moderately acidic. Nitrogen and Potassium were in
    the low to medium range where as Phosphorus was in the range of low to high content.
    Organic matter content was in the high range where as electrical conductivity
    and Sulphur content in the soil samples were in the low range. Micronutrients
    Iron, Manganese, Zinc, Copper and Boron were in sufficient amount where as Chloride
    content was in the range of high to very high. Water holding capacity and % of
    moisture were also determined. Study recommends the use of selected and limited
    amount of fertilizers to improve the fertility status of the selected locations
    to get high yield and better quality of products. </pre>
