  title: An operational UAV-based approach for stand-level assessment of soil disturbance
    after forest harvesting
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of generating virtual transects on unmanned
    aerial vehicle-derived orthomosaics&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;was evaluated in estimating the extent of soil disturbance by severity
    class. Combinations of 4&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;transect lengths (5 &ndash; 50 m) and five sampling intensities (1 &ndash;
    20 transects per ha) were used in&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;assessing traffic intensity and the severity of soil disturbance on six
    post-harvest, cut-to-length&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;(CTL) clearfell sites. In total, 15% of the 33 ha studied showed some
    trace of vehicle traffic. Of this,&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;63% of was categorized as light (no visible surface disturbance). Traffic
    intensity varied from 787 to&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;1256 m ha &minus; 1 , with a weighted mean of 956 m ha &minus; 1 , approximately
    twice the geometrical minimum&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;achievable with CTL technology under perfect conditions. An overall weighted
    mean of 4.7% of the&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;total site area was compromised by severe rutting. A high sampling intensity,
    increasing with&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;decreasing incidence of soil disturbance, is required if mean estimation
    error is to be kept below&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;20%. The paper presents a methodology that can be generally applied in
    forest management or in&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;similar land-use evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;'
