  title: Assessing the Environmental Impact of Oil Spillage on Soil in Nigeria, using
    NNPC Depot as a Case Study
  abstract: "The sustainability of environment depends largely on the sustainable\
    \ soil ecosystem as soil is taken as a key component of natural ecosystems. Soil\
    \ contamination has been an environmental problem that is facing the whole regions\
    \ of the world. The source of contamination may be either natural or anthropogenic.\
    \ This research assessed the impact of oil spill on soil in Nigeria, using NNPC\
    \ Depot as a case study. Soil samples were taken from the study area at four different\
    \ points at a depth of 0.5-1.0 m using hand-dug auger. These samples were collected\
    \ in sterilized bags and were well labelled. The following tests were conducted\
    \ on the soil samples (contaminated and uncontaminated): Particle size distribution\
    \ test, Compaction test, Atterberg Limit test and Permeability test. The particle\
    \ size test revealed that the variation between the two samples (contaminated\
    \ and uncontaminated) is insignificant but the presence of oil in the contaminated\
    \ sample caused clod thereby making it difficult to pass through some sieve sizes.\
    \ The Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) and the Maximum Dry Density (MDD) gave 11.40%,\
    \ 1.98 g/cm\xB3 and 9.50%, 1.81g/cm\xB3 for both uncontaminated and contaminated\
    \ samples respectively. Likewise, The Liquid Limits (LL) and plastic limit (Pl)\
    \ gave 48 %, 33.5% and 33.6% and 14.9% for both uncontaminated and contaminated\
    \ samples respectively. Also, the coefficient of permeability \u201Ck\u201D gave\
    \ 2.792 x 10-7 cm/s compared with the standard (soil permeability classes for\
    \ Civil Engineering) falls within the impermeability limit (1 X 10-11 \u2013 5\
    \ X 10-7 ) Thus the test results revealed that the contamination of soil by crude\
    \ oil in NNPC Apata influenced the properties of the soil and subsequently leads\
    \ to reduction in the values obtained for the entire test that the soil sample\
    \ was subjected to"
