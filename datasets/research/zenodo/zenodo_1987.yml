  title: Effect of Crushed Coconut Shell and Human Hair Fiber on Strength Characteristics
    of Clay Soil
  abstract: They not only have the propensity to swell but also to shrink when the
    prevailing moisture condition changes because clay soils have good plastic capabilities,
    which results in their lower shear strength, compressive strength, and volume
    variations. It is necessary to improve its strength characteristics and make it
    suitable for construction. In the absence of an effective waste disposal, the
    utilization of Crushed coconut shell (CCS) and Human hair fibre (HHF) for soil
    improvement will be a welcome development. They can be made useful for improving
    the strength characteristics of soil and to solve the problems related to the
    disposal of waste HHF. The present study focuses on investigating the effectiveness
    in improvement of clay soil strength properties by the inclusion of HHF and CCS.UCC
    test were conducted with varying percentage of CCS and HHF which is randomly distributed.
    The result shows that the use of CCS and HHF increases the strength of clayey
    soil. The maximum UCC value is obtained for 1% CCS and 0.75% HHF combination.
