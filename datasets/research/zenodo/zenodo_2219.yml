  title: Some Features of Cambisols Soil-Forming Process from Training and Experimental
    Forest Range (TEFR) "Petrohan" Region.
  abstract: Dystric/eutric Cambisols diagnostic features from TEFR Petrohan were investigated
    in the present study, which morphologically corresponded to Podzols. Diagnostic
    horizons were investigated to establish presence or absence of podsolization process
    and to classify the soil type according to the modern requirements of WRB, (2006,
    2007; 2014). Humus forming process insitu, clearly expressed in the Ah horizon,
    acidification, degradation of clay minerals, formation of E horizon, which is
    clay-poor with increased content of sand, accumulation of Fe and other mobile
    elements in Bw horizon were established. The metamorphic Bw horizon had some diagnostic
    properties, which met these of spodic horizon. This horizon is specific for the
    Podzols. The content of organic carbon in it was less than 0.5 %. Cambisols properties
    are predominant.It was established that the soil-forming process in the investigated
    Cambisols is directed to podsolization process.
