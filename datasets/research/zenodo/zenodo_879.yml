  title: Experiential Investigation on the Stabilization of Dispersive Soil with Lime
  abstract: 'The soils that are highly susceptible to erosion and containing high
    percentage of exchangeable sodium ions are called Dispersive Soils. In appearance,
    dispersive clays are like normal clays that are stable and somewhat resistant
    to erosion, but in reality they can be highly erosive and subject to severe damage
    or failure. Using dispersive clay soils in hydraulic structures, embankment dams,
    or other structures such as roadway, embankments can cause serious engineering
    problems if these soils are not stabilized and used appropriately. This problem
    is worldwide, and structural failures attributed to dispersive soils have occurred
    in many countries. This paper presents the stabilization of dispersive soil with
    lime. The soil sample is taken from Mandalay. Grain size distribution, Atterberg''s
    limit test, compaction test, unconfined compressive strength UCS test and triaxial
    test are carried out to obtain the properties of soil. Type of studied soil classified
    by unified classification system is lean clay with sand. Crumb test is performed
    to know the dispersion degree of study soil. According to crumb test, the study
    soil is highly dispersive clay soil. Lime is used as stabilizing agent. The amount
    of lime used is 2 , 3 and 4 by dry weight of soil. The studied soil is mixed various
    contents of lime, and then crumb test is performed. At dispersive soil mixed with
    4 of lime, there is no dispersion characteristic in soil. For stabilization of
    studied soil, 4 of lime is selected to investigate the improvement of strength
    in treated soil. The treated soil is performed compaction test, unconfined compression
    strength UCS test and triaxial test. Unconfined compression strength of treated
    soil at 4 lime is increased as 1.12 times that of natural soil. The shear strength
    of treated soil increases about 2 times than that of natural soil. The cohesion
    value of treated soil increases about 1.12 times and the angle of internal friction
    increases about 1.23 times than that of natural soil. Finally, it is concluded
    from this study that the lime treated soil is more resistant to erosion and the
    treated soil is more resistant to shear stress and lateral pressure. Soe Soe War
