  title: The Diversity of Nepenthes Species and Their Rhizosphere Soil Properties
    Around The Lore Lindu National Park Area, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
  abstract: <em>Lore Lindu National Park is one of the most important ecosystem protection
    areas in Central Sulawesi. However, currently, the conservation area is threatened
    by mining activities, both legal and illegal, such as gold mining, which of course
    threatens the sustainability of the biological resources in it. On the one hand,
    research on endemic flora and their potential for symbiosis with soil microbes
    is still lacking, especially in conservation areas. This study aims to determine
    the diversity of Nepenthes spp that grow both outside and inside the Lore Lindu
    National Park area, their ecological characteristics and the potential for symbiosis
    with soil microbes. The results showed that in each research location two types
    of Napenthes were found, namely Nepenthes mirabilis with 23 individuals in Padang
    Padaeha and 71 individuals in pine stands, then Nepenthes tentaculata with 77
    individuals in Padang Padaeha and 109 in pine stands. Both types of Napenthes
    are associated with other plant species such as Eucalyptus deglupta, Imperata
    cilindrica, Selaginella plana, Gleichenia linearis, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Blechnum
    sp, Stenoclaena palustris, Dicronapteris linearis, Lycopodiella cernua, Lygodium
    microphyllum, Clidemia hirta and Digitaria sp. The Nepenthes species diversity
    index in both locations was in the low category. Furthermore, the fungal population
    was also higher than the bacterial population in both research sites as effects
    of soil characteritics. The results of this study can be used as a basis for in-situ
    conservation of these species in the future, especially in the national park area</em>
