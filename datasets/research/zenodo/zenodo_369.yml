  title: Influence of Presowing Soil Water and Seed Iron-Coating on Iron in Soil and
    Yield of Dryland Rice
  abstract: This article 'Influence of Presowing Soil Water and Seed Iron-Coating
    on Iron in Soil and Yield of Dryland Rice' appeared in the International Rice
    Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
