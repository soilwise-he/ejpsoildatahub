  title: Metagenomic Insights into the Bacterial Functions of a Diesel-Degrading Consortium
    for the Rhizoremediation of Diesel-Polluted Soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Diesel is a complex pollutant composed of a mixture of aliphatic and
    aromatic hydrocarbons. Because of this complexity, diesel bioremediation requires
    multiple microorganisms, which harbor the catabolic pathways to degrade the mixture.
    By enrichment cultivation of rhizospheric soil from a diesel-polluted site, we
    have isolated a bacterial consortium that can grow aerobically with diesel and
    different alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as the sole carbon
    and energy source. Microbiome diversity analyses based on 16S rRNA gene showed
    that the diesel-degrading consortium consists of 76 amplicon sequence variants
    (ASVs) and it is dominated by&nbsp;Pseudomonas,&nbsp;Aquabacterium,&nbsp;Chryseobacterium,
    and&nbsp;Sphingomonadaceae.&nbsp;Changes in microbiome composition were observed
    when growing on specific hydrocarbons, reflecting that different populations degrade
    different hydrocarbons. Shotgun metagenome sequence analysis of the consortium
    growing on diesel has identified redundant genes encoding enzymes implicated in
    the initial oxidation of alkanes (AlkB, LadA, CYP450) and a variety of hydroxylating
    and ring-cleavage dioxygenases involved in aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbon
    degradation. The phylogenetic assignment of these enzymes to specific genera allowed
    us to model the role of specific populations in the diesel-degrading consortium.
    Rhizoremediation of diesel-polluted soil microcosms using the consortium, resulted
    in an important enhancement in the reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs),
    making it suited for rhizoremediation applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
