  title: 'Soil Degradation and Remediation: Strategies for Restoring Soil Quality'
  abstract: To ensure an adequate food supply for the growing global population, which
    was approximately 7.3 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach 9.5 billion by
    2050, a substantial increase of approximately 70% in agricultural production is
    necessary between 2005 and 2050. However, this required increase in agricultural
    output is hindered by soil degradation, which manifests as a decline in quality
    and a reduction in ecosystem goods and services. Soil, being a finite/non-renewable
    resource within human timescales, is susceptible to degradation due to intricate
    interactions among processes, factors, and causes that occur at various spatial
    and temporal scales. Accelerated erosion, depletion of the SOC pool, loss of biodiversity,
    diminished soil fertility, elemental imbalances, acidification, and salinization
    are among the prominent soil degradation processes. To counteract soil degradation
    trends, it is crucial to transition to restorative land use practices and adopt
    recommended management techniques. The overarching approach is centred on minimizing
    soil erosion, establishing positive balances of SOC and nitrogen, enhancing the
    activity and diversity of soil organisms across various scales (micro, meso, and
    macro), and improving the stability of soil structure and pore geometry. Enhancing
    soil quality, including increasing the SOC pool, enhancing soil structure, and
    promoting soil fertility, can mitigate the risks associated with physical, chemical,
    biological, and ecological soil degradation, while simultaneously benefiting the
    environment. A critical step towards initiating the restoration process is to
    raise the SOC pool above the critical threshold of 10 to 15 g kg<sup>-1</sup>.
    Site-specific methods for restoring soil quality encompass conservation agriculture,
    integrated nutrient management, the adoption of continuous vegetative covers like
    residue mulch and cover cropping, and implementing controlled grazing at appropriate
    stocking rates. The overarching strategy is to maximize productivity by minimizing
    losses and optimizing the efficiency of soil, water, and nutrient utilization.
    In conclusion, restorative land use and site-specific approaches are vital for
    addressing soil degradation, meeting food demands, enhancing soil quality, and
    ensuring sustainable agriculture amid population growth. This chapter aims to
    provide an overview of soil degradation in India and identify potential strategies
    for improving soil quality to mitigate risks of soil degradation.
