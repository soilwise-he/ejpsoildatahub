  title: New empirical backscattering models for estimating bare soil surface parameters
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Various models have been proposed to estimate the degree of backscatter
    in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. However, it is still necessary to calibrate
    these models based on the characteristics of different study areas and to propose
    new models to achieve the highest possible accuracy in estimating the backscattering
    coefficient (&sigma;0) SAR. In this study, three empirical models, including Champion,
    Sahebi and Zribi/Dechambre, were initially calibrated for two SAR datasets (i.e.
    The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) and Canadian Space Agency radar
    satellite (RADARSAT-1)) acquired over two bare soil study areas with various soil
    characteristics. The Zribi/Dechambre model was then modified by revising the roughness
    parameter to obtain higher accuracy in estimating &sigma;0 over a larger range
    of incidence angles (&theta;). A new empirical model was also proposed by combining
    the four parameters of Soil Moisture (SM), standard deviation of surface height
    -root mean square- (rms), correlation length (l), and &theta;. To this end, the
    most appropriate form of the regression model was investigated and used for each
    of these parameters to obtain the highest correlation between the in-situ data
    and &sigma;0 values. A comparison of the empirical models showed that the modified
    Zribi/Dechambre had the highest accuracy in predicting &sigma;0 values with the
    Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 1.20 dB and 1.59 dB over Oklahoma and Quebec,
    respectively. Furthermore, coefficients values of the new proposed model remained
    stable in the two datasets unlike the other investigated models. In this study,
    the effects of l on the accuracy of the new proposed model were also assessed.
    It was concluded that l had a considerable impact on the accuracy of the proposed
    model and including this parameter can improve the accuracy by up to 1 dB.&lt;/p&gt;'
