  title: Bio-organic fertilizer with reduced rates of chemical fertilisation improves
    soil fertility and enhances tomato yield and quality
  abstract: "The extensive use of chemical fertilizers poses serious collateral problems\
    \ such as environmental pollution, pest resistance development and food safety\
    \ decline. Researches focused on applying plant-beneficial microorganisms to partially\
    \ replace chemical fertilizer use is increasing due to the requirement of sustainable\
    \ agriculture development. Thus to investigate the possibility of a plant beneficial\
    \ Trichoderma strain and its bio-organic fertilizer product in saving chemical\
    \ fertilizer application and in improving crop quality, a field trial and continuous\
    \ pot experiments were carried out with tomato. Four treatments were set up: a\
    \ reduced application of chemical fertilizer (75% of the conventional application)\
    \ plus Trichoderma-enriched bio-organic fertilizer (BF), organic fertilizer (OF)\
    \ or Trichoderma spore suspension (SS), with using the 100% rate of the conventional\
    \ chemical fertilizer as the control (CF). The results showed that the total soluble\
    \ sugar, Vitamin C and nitrate accumulations were, respectively, +up to 24%, +up\
    \ to 57% and \u2013up to 62% in the tomatoes of the BF treatment compared to those\
    \ of the control (CF). And both of the pot and field trials revealed that reduced\
    \ rates of chemical fertilizer plus bio-organic fertilizer produced tomato yields\
    \ equivalent to those obtained using the 100% of the chemical fertilizer. However,\
    \ application with the inoculant alone (SS) or combined with the organic fertilizer\
    \ alone (OF) would lead to a yield decreases of 6\u201338% and 9\u201335% over\
    \ the control. Since the increased abundance of soil microfora and the enhanced\
    \ soil fertility frequently showed positive linear correlations especially in\
    \ the BF-treated soils, we conclude that the efficacy of this bioorganic fertilizer\
    \ for maintaining a stable tomato yield and improving tomato quality may be due\
    \ to the improved soil microbial activity. Thus, the results suggest that the\
    \ Trichoderma bio-organic fertilizer could be employed in combination with the\
    \ appropriate rates of chemical fertilizers to get maximum benefits regarding\
    \ yield, quality and fertilizer savings."
