  title: Soil electrical conductivity imaging of the soil profile and its relationship
    to soil properties
  abstract: "The variability of soil properties in space and time is a challenge to\
    \ their measurement. Currently, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of the\
    \ soil profile can be used to estimate indirectly the spatial variability of the\
    \ soil properties: salinity, texture, cation-exchange capacity and moisture content.\
    \ An electromagnetic induction sensor does not require direct contact with the\
    \ ground, and data collection is relatively easy, rapid, and inexpensive. This\
    \ allows a larger number of measurements and more comprehensive coverage of sites\
    \ than is possible with traditional soil sampling methods. A quasi-2D electromagnetic\
    \ conductivity model for a field site was developed using electrical conductivity\
    \ (ECa) data measured by a multi-coil DUALEM-421 sensor and a DUALEM-1s sensor.\
    \ Relationships of estimated ECa with volumetric water content (\u0398v) and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC) were reasonably accurate (R2 = 0.62 for DUALEM-421 and\
    \ 0.58 for DUALEM-1s and R2 = 0.68 for DUALEM-421 and 0.58 for DUALEM-1s for \u0398\
    v and CEC, respectively). These relationships were used to derive depth profile\
    \ images. As expected, \u0398v, CEC and the estimated ECa follow similar trends\
    \ down the soil profile. This soil ECa imaging method shows good potential for\
    \ predicting 2D depth profiles of certain soil properties."
