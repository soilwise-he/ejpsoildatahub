  title: "Seismic velocity of P-waves to evaluate strength of stabilized soil for\
    \ Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget Biorefinery \xD6strand AB, Timr\xE5"
  abstract: "Evaluating soil strength by geophysical methods using P-waves was undertaken\
    \ in this study to assess the effects of changed binder ratios on stabilisation\
    \ and compression characteristics. The materials included dredged sediments collected\
    \ in the seabed of Timr\xE5 region, north Sweden. The Portland cement (Basement\
    \ CEM II / A-V, SS EN 197-1) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS)\
    \ were used as stabilisers. The experiments were performed on behalf of the Svenska\
    \ Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA) Biorefinery \xD6strand AB pulp mill. Quantity of\
    \ binder included 150, 120 and 100 kg. The properties of soil were evaluated after\
    \ 28, 42, 43, 70, 71 and 85 days of curing using applied geophysical methods of\
    \ measuring the travel time of primary wave propagation. The P-waves were determined\
    \ to evaluate the strength of stabilised soils. The results demonstrated variation\
    \ of P-waves velocity depending on stabilising agent and curing time in various\
    \ ratios: Low water / High binder (L W H B), High water / Low binder (H W L B)\
    \ and percentage of agents (CEM II / A-V/GGBFS) as 30%/70%, 50%/50% and 70%/30%.\
    \ The compression characteristics of soils were assessed using Uniaxial Compressive\
    \ Strength (UCS). The P-wave velocities were higher for samples stabilized with\
    \ L W H B compared to those with H W L B. The primary wave propagation increased\
    \ over curing time for all stabilized mixes along with the increased UCS, which\
    \ proves a tight correlation with the increased strength of soil solidified by\
    \ the agents. Increased water ratio gives a lower strength by maintained amount\
    \ of binder and vice versa."
