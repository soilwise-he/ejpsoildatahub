  title: Method for Evaluation of Soil Conditions Suitable for Growing Emmer and Einkorn
    Wheat
  abstract: Method is developed for the field rating of main soil characteristics
    that define the suitability for growing emmer and einkorn wheat. Soil texture
    of the fallow land, depth of the humus horizon, depth of the soil profile, texture
    differentiation of the soil profile, soil reaction, humus content and groundwater
    level have been evaluated. The method is harmonized with the officially accepted
    in Bulgaria parametric methods of the system of field ratings and the categorization
    of the agricultural lands. The end result is an evaluation of the soil conditions
    and a soil rating.
