  title: Effect Of Soil Tillage System Upon The Soil Properties, Weed Control, Quality
    And Quantity Yield In Some Arable Crops
  abstract: "The paper presents the influence of the conventional\nploughing tillage\
    \ technology in comparison with the minimum\ntillage, upon the soil properties,\
    \ weed control and yield in the case of\nmaize (Zea mays L.), soya-bean (Glycine\
    \ hispida L.) and winter\nwheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a three years crop rotation.\
    \ A\nresearch has been conducted at the University of Agricultural\nSciences and\
    \ Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The use of\nminimum soil tillage systems\
    \ within a three years rotation: maize,\nsoya-bean, wheat favorites the rise of\
    \ the aggregates hydro stability\nwith 5.6-7.5% on a 0-20 cm depth and 5-11% on\
    \ 20-30 cm depth.\nThe minimum soil tillage systems \u2013 paraplow, chisel or\
    \ rotary grape\n\u2013 are polyvalent alternatives for basic preparation, germination\
    \ bed\npreparation and sowing, for fields and crops with moderate loose\nrequirements\
    \ being optimized technologies for: soil natural fertility\nactivation and rationalization,\
    \ reduction of erosion, increasing the\naccumulation capacity for water and realization\
    \ of sowing in the\noptimal period. The soil tillage system influences the productivity\n\
    elements of cultivated species and finally the productions thus\nobtained. Thus,\
    \ related to conventional working system, the\nproductions registered in minimum\
    \ tillage working represented 89-\n97% in maize, 103-112% in soya-bean, 93-99%\
    \ in winter-wheat. The\nresults of investigations showed that the yield is a conclusion\
    \ soil\ntillage systems influence on soil properties, plant density assurance\n\
    and on weed control. Under minimum tillage systems in the case of\nwinter weat\
    \ as an option for replacing classic ploughing, the best\nresults in terms of\
    \ quality indices were obtained from version worked\nwith paraplow, followed by\
    \ rotary harrow and chisel. At variants\nworked with paraplow were obtained quality\
    \ indices close to those of\nthe variant worked with plow, and protein and gluten\
    \ content was\neven higher. At Ariesan variety, highest protein content, 12.50%\
    \ and\ngluten, 28.6% was obtained for the variant paraplow."
