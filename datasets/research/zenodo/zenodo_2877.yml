  title: Optimization of culture conditions for higher production of antimicrobial
    compounds by AZ-130 bacterial strain isolated from soil of Azerbaijan
  abstract: "AZ-130 bacterial strain was isolated from soil sample collected from\
    \ Azerbaijan in 2014. After preliminarily culture and supernatant screenings for\
    \ novel antibacterial compounds, AZ-130 showed strong gram-positive activity against\
    \ pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis strains. Based on\
    \ range of its activity, AZ-130 strain that produces AZ-130 antibacterial compound\
    \ was selected for the further characterization. The main goal of this study is\
    \ to optimize growth conditions for AZ-130 to determine the optimal medium, incubation\
    \ temperature and time point in which the production of the antimicrobial compound\
    \ is highest. To achieve this goal, 4 different media types at 4 different temperatures,\
    \ in total 16 different growth conditions were tested. Supernatants were collected\
    \ and clarified at day 1, 2 and 3 or 5. All collected supernatants were analyzed\
    \ by spot test and broth microdilution method against S.aureus. According to the\
    \ spot test and broth microdilution results, AZ-130 produces the most antimicrobial\
    \ compound in TB + 2% Glucose medium at 32\xB0C; incubation time is 2 days."
