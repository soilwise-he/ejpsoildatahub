  title: SOIL MAPPING OF WEST MENIA AREA, EGYPT USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES.
  abstract: "The Western Menia area represents one of the highest priority areas for\
    \ future development in the country. The studied area is located between 27\uF0B0\
    \ 53\uF0A2 20.11\uF0B2 ? 27\uF0B0 58\uF0A2 48.34\uF0B2 North and 30\uF0B0 06\uF0A2\
    \ 41.53\uF0B2 ? 30\uF0B0 13\uF0A2 6.57\uF0B2 East and represents an area of about\
    \ 9078 Feddans. Using geological map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and visual\
    \ interpretation of satellite data, a physiographic soil map was produced to present\
    \ mapping units of the studied area. The area under investigation was classified\
    \ into two landscapes, i.e. alluvial plain (4181 Feddans, 46.06 % of the total\
    \ studied area) and terraces (4897 Feddans, 53.94 % of the total studied area)\
    \ This study aims to assess and mapping soil properties for salinity, sodicity,\
    \ lime, gypsum, depth and texture. Land capability was used to evaluate the soils\
    \ of studied area. According to Sys model, the studied area was classified into\
    \ four capability subclasses, i.e. S2x, S3t, S3d and S3d, t. The soils of S2xhave\
    \ moderate limitations for agricultural crops, whereas texture is the most limiting\
    \ factor (48.55 % of the total area). The most limiting factor of soils of S3t\
    \ is topography (12.89 %), while the soils of S3d (27.89 % of the total studied\
    \ area) whereas the depth is the most limiting factor. On other, hand the soils\
    \ of S3d, t (10.66 % of the total studied area) whereas the depth and topography\
    \ are the main limiting factor for agriculture. Soil fertility maps were conducted\
    \ for macronutrients and micronutrients."
