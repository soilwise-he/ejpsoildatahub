  title: Microclimate monitoring network based on Soil-Atmosphere Measurement Complexes
  abstract: Microclimate is a complex of climatic conditions organized by local landscape.
    Air and soil tempera-<br> ture, solar radiation, wind speed, and moisture conditions
    are significant factors that form ecological<br> patterns in plant and animal
    communities. The importance of the influence of microclimate on<br> growth and
    die-off, soil respiration, and nutrient cycling is one of the components of modern
    ecological re-<br> search.<br> Russia has a network of weather stations of the
    Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental<br> Monitoring (Rosgydromet),
    organized to conduct global, comprehensive, systematic, continuous observations<br>
    of the natural environment. Weather stations must be located in an area that is
    open and typical of the surround-<br> ing terrain. However, on the territory of
    Siberia their network is extremely sparse and not regular. Weather sta-<br> tions
    are located in open areas mainly in river valleys, and the information obtained
    at them does not fully re-<br> flect the situation in the forest, mires and mountain
    landscapes represented on the territory.<br> In order to provide ecological and
    landscape studies with meteorological information, a network of auto-<br> mated
    observation points has been forming at the Institute of Monitoring of Climate
    and Ecological Systems<br> (IMCES SB RAS) since 2005, where basic meteorological
    characteristics are registered. The network of micro-<br> climatic monitoring
    that we are developing is focused on continuous observations in typical landscapes
    in key<br> areas located in different natural-climatic zones. Historically, various
    projects have formed clusters of observa-<br> tion sites, usually located close
    to each other, but characterized by different local landscape conditions. Micro-<br>
    climatic monitoring is organized in the areas of forest-marsh complexes in Western
    Siberia, mountain-bottom<br> landscapes of the Baikal region.<br> Atmospheric-soil
    measuring complexes (ASMC) are used for monitoring. ASMC is intended for mobile<br>
    and stationary long-term automatic measurements and registration of the main parameters
    of the atmosphere,<br> soils and water. ASMC can be equipped with sensors for
    soil and air temperature, snow cover height and tem-<br> perature, ground water
    level, precipitation, wind speed and direction, soil and air humidity, solar radiation<br>
    characteristics, carbon dioxide concentration, etc. The difference from the existing
    measuring systems is the<br> combination of low power consumption, wide range
    of sensors, autonomous operation mode, operability in a<br> wide range of operating
    conditions and low price. Autonomous controller-recorder with analog or digital
    inter-<br> face allows to use ASMC as in the basic configuration with the possibility
    of data transmission in online mode,<br> and in the vandal-proof configuration
    (measuring only temperature and humidity of air and soil) with data ac-<br> cumulation
    inside the device. ASMC software gives the possibility of visual presentation
    of data series, which<br> are exported into a text format. The ASMC is capable
    of continuously measuring microclimate characteristics<br> for several years,
    even under the most extreme conditions. Therefore, the instrument can be used
    to create ex-<br> tensive specialized networks of field measurements providing
    essential data on microclimatic conditions shap-<br> ing biological processes
    under climate change conditions.
