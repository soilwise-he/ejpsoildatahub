  title: 'The Abc soil types: Podzoluvisols, Albeluvisols or Retisols? A review'
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> At an archaeological excavation site in central\
    \ Belgium, we found whitish soil material interspersing a clay illuviation horizon\
    \ under a Roman road. Starting from this case, we will illustrate how insights\
    \ into soil formation and soil geography are relevant for understanding landscape\
    \ evolution and archaeology. We do this by focusing on the \u2018Abc\u2019 soil\
    \ types, which are silt-loam soils that are well-drained and have a mottled and\
    \ discontinuous clay illuviation horizon. In Belgium, these soils are, almost\
    \ exclusively, found under ancient forests. To explain their formation, two hypotheses\
    \ have been proposed. A first assumes that chemical weathering leads to the degradation\
    \ of the clay illuviation horizon, a process enhanced by the acidifying effect\
    \ of forest vegetation. A second hypothesis explains their morphology as relict\
    \ features from periglacial phenomena. We further review how views on their formation\
    \ were reflected in Soil Taxonomy (Glossudalfs), the FAO legend of the soil map\
    \ of the world (Podzoluvisols) and in the World Reference Base for soil resources\
    \ (Albeluvisols and Retisols). If we accept the hypothesis that the morphology\
    \ of the Abc soil types has to be attributed to periglacial phenomena, Abc soil\
    \ types must have been more widespread before deforestation. Agricultural activities\
    \ promoted the homogenisation of the subsoil and the fading of their morphologic\
    \ characteristics. A Roman road would have prevented such a homogenisation process.\
    \ These insights help elucidate the evolution of past and current landscapes.<br>"
