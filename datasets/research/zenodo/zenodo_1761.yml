  title: Sustainable agricultural practices to improve soil quality and productivity
    of soybean and upland rice
  abstract: Combining the use of cover crops with multifunctional microorganisms provides
    significant increments in the grain productivity of soybean and upland rice crops.
    However, there are still few studies that aimed to evaluate the effect of this
    combination on the productivity of agricultural systems. The objective of this
    study was to determine the effect of the mix of cover crops and the coinoculation
    of multifunctional rhizobacteria on the quality of the soil, on the yield components,
    and on the grain yield of soybean and upland rice. The experimental design was
    in random blocks with 24 treatments in a 6x2x2 factorial scheme. Treatments were
    the combination of 6 (5 mix of cover crops and the control (fallow)), 2 (upland
    rice and soybeans), 2 (coinoculated or not), with four replications. The use of
    mix of cover crops provided an increase in Ca and Mn levels in the soil, increased
    activity of soil quality indicator enzymes (phosphatase and arylsulfatase), higher
    soybean yield, and higher number of upland rice panicles. The coinoculation with
    multifunctional rhizobacteria led to an increase in phosphorus levels in the soil,
    in the number of pods per plant, in the mass of 100 grains for soybean cultivation,
    in the number of grains per panicle, and in the productivity of upland rice. Therefore,
    a mix of cover crops, combined with the coinoculation with multifunctional rhizobacteria
    are sustainable agricultural practices that can contribute to the improvement
    of soil quality and the increase of the productivity of soybean and upland rice
    crops.
