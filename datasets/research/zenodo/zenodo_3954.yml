  title: Hydrodynamic real-time hybrid simulation to examine aero-hydrostructural-soil
    dynamics of offshore monopile wind turbines
  abstract: 'Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are expected to play a major role in the
    energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, OWTs are subjected
    to complex dynamic forces due to combined wind and wave loading, along with soil-structure
    interaction effects. Due to incompatibilities in simulating multiple dynamic forces
    simultaneously at model scale, conventional experimental approaches are limited
    in simulating the response of the wind turbines subjected to combined aero- and
    hydro-dynamic forces interacting with soil-structural dynamics. Real-time hybrid
    simulation (RTHS) is a numerical-physical simulation approach that can alleviate
    similitude limitations by partitioning the system dynamics into physical and numerical
    subassemblies that interact through sensors and actuators in real time. A hydrodynamic
    RTHS framework, hydro-RTHS, is presented to simulate the response of a monopile
    OWT subjected to simultaneous wind and wave loading. The system was partitioned
    such that: [a] the hydrodynamics on the tower were modeled physically at model
    scale and [b] the remaining dynamics, including aerodynamics, structural dynamics,
    and soil effects, were modeled numerically at full scale. Wind forces applied
    at the hub were pre-simulated and applied to the numerical soil-structure model.
    Force feedback from the pre-determined wind loading and measured physical wave
    loading was used in the governing equations to calculate command displacements,
    which were physically applied using an actuator and virtually applied in the numerical
    soil-structure model. Geometry, time, and forces used to actuate and measure the
    physical model were scaled via Froude scaling to more realistically represent
    the hydrodynamic forces in the governing equations. Results demonstrate that the
    hydro-RTHS can simulate combined aero-hydro-structural-soil response of monopile
    OWT, which cannot be obtained using conventional approaches with distorted similitude
    effects.'
