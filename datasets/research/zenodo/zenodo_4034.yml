  title: Evaluation of Soil and Organic Matter of a Watershed along River Aya, Ogoja
    Reach, Cross River State, Nigeria
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nWatersheds are believed to transport organic matter and washed\
    \ nutrients from high lands and deposits along the flood plains, making the area\
    \ soils fertile. The certainty that watershed flood plains are highly fertile\
    \ makes farmers in developing countries clamour for farm lands around watershed\
    \ flood plains. This could be mere speculation if a soil from a particular flood\
    \ plain is not subjected to laboratory analytical tests. A watershed basin along\
    \ river Aya, at Ogoja reach is one of such flood plains. Soils were taken from\
    \ 3 different areas within a particular farm in the watershed basin and tested\
    \ for soil constituents and organic matter content. All the soil classes were\
    \ found to be light to medium in texture varying between sandy clay loam at the\
    \ surface level of 0-15 cm and few classes of clay loam at the 15-30 cm soil depth\
    \ with some variation in silt and clay along the depth of the soil profile. Sand\
    \ ranged from 50.2% at land surface to 32.9% at bottom site; Silt had higher weighted\
    \ average of 27.6%\_ compared to 26.6% weighted average at Midland site; clay\_\
    \ increase with increase in slope varying from 22.5% at the surface to 32.7% in\
    \ the lower horizon. Soil reactivity (pH) on study site was slightly acidic with\
    \ values ranging from5.35 to 6.46. Bulk density had averages of 1.19 g/cm3for\
    \ Highland site, 1.43g/cm3midland and 1.20g/cm3Lowland site respectively. All\
    \ the weight ranges are favourable for farming and conducive to normal root distribution\
    \ of crop plants. The three macronutrients (N, P, K) values fluctuated among the\
    \ sites but all fall under \u201Cmedium\u201D category by fertility standard ratings.\
    \ This result showed that not all watershed soils are exceptionally fertile as\
    \ believed by rural farmers that could have classify the soil fertility standard\
    \ to be \u201Cvery high\u201D.\_"
