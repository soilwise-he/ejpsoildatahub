  title: A comparison of methods to estimate harvest-induced damage to the soil using
    the example of a beech timber stand
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study determines the extent of soil disturbances occurring
    during mechanised harvesting operations in a beech timber stand and investigates
    whether applying different research methods can be used to classify, in a&lt;br
    /&gt;

    comparable way, forest areas with different levels of soil damage. In the analysed
    stand, felling and on-side processing were conducted with chainsaws, while extraction
    &ndash; using an farm tractor. After the completion of logging operations,&lt;br
    /&gt;

    visible soil disturbances on each sample plot were measured, including surface
    area, volume and depth, and the value of five most common indicators of soil damage
    was calculated. The share of disturbed surface area, the volume of soil&lt;br
    /&gt;

    disturbances and different soil damage indicators allowed sample plots to be arranged
    in the same way according to increasing levels of soil damage occurring during
    harvesting. A different order was observed only in relation to the depth&lt;br
    /&gt;

    of the ruts formed. The similarity of the applied measures and classifications
    of soil disturbances indicates that all of the methods can be applied to make
    simple comparisons of the degree of soil damage. Because field trials are easy
    to&lt;br /&gt;

    perform, soil damage indicators based on a visual assessment of soil condition,
    without the need to take measurements, are worth recommending at first. A fuller
    picture of the level and nature of detected soil damage, however, can be obtained
    by taking into account the depth of the disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;'
