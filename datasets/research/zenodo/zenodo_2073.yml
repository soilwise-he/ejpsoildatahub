  title: ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL SOLID WASTE (BAGSSE ASH) ON THE
    CHARACTERISTICS OF EXPANSIVE SOIL
  abstract: Expansive soils expand when they are wet and contract when they are wet,
    resulting in a variety of issues and the potential failure of structures built
    on top of them. Before constructing any structure over expansive soil, an engineer
    must therefore evaluate and possibly modify its properties. Bagasse Ash, an industrial
    solid waste, is mixed with expansive soil in this study as an admixture. Most
    of the time, bagasse ash is deposited in an unscientific and random manner, reducing
    valuable space and causing numerous geo-environmental issues. The waste bagasse
    ash is tried to be used in this study. The properties of the soil are examined
    and the changes in the soil's properties are evaluated at various percentages
    of Bagasse Ash after the Virgin Expansive Soil is mixed with it. An effort is
    made to lower the soil's plasticity index and increase the expansive soil's strength.
