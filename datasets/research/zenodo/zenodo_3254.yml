  title: 'Measurement of the connectivity of runoff source areas as determined by
    vegetation pattern and topography: A tool for assessing potential water and soil
    losses in drylands'
  abstract: The connectivity of runoff sources is considered one of the main factors
    controlling the hydrology of sparsely vegetated landscapes. However, the empirical
    demonstration of this role is very limited, partly because of the scarcity of
    suitable connectivity metrics. In this work, we derived and tested a spatial metric,
    Flowlength, for quantifying the connectivity of runoff source areas considering
    both vegetation pattern and topography. Flowlength is calculated as the average
    of the runoff pathway lengths from all the cells in a raster-based map of the
    target site. We evaluated the relationships between the connectivity of runoff
    sources, measured with Flowlength, and the runoff and sediment yields from six
    plots and three catchments in semiarid southeast Spain. Flowlength distinguished
    varying degrees of connectivity between differing vegetation patterns with similar
    vegetation cover. The connectivity increased with the grain size of the bare areas
    and was positively related to plot runoff and sediment yields. Flowlength also
    correctly ranked the three catchments according to total runoff yielded during
    the study period. The inclusion of microtopographic information in the quantification
    of Flowlength improved the relationships between the pattern of runoff sources
    and the measured fluxes, highlighting the importance of topographic features in
    the connectivity of surface flows. In general, the microtopography had a net decreasing
    effect on the connectivity, which was mainly attributed to an increase in the
    amount of runoff sink areas caused by the sediment terracettes developed upslope
    of plants. Our results confirm that the connectivity of runoff sources is a key
    factor controlling runoff and erosion in semiarid lands and support the potential
    of Flowlength as a surrogate for the hydrological functioning of ecosystems with
    patchy vegetation.
