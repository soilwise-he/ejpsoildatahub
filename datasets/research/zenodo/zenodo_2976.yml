  title: Nutrient Depletion, Organic Matter Loss, Soil Acidification, Sodicity, and
    Salinization Resulted Due To Nature Interactions. Causes and Way Forward, A Review
  abstract: <strong>Nutrient depletion, organic matter loss, salinity, sodicity, and
    acidity are as a result of natural interactions that have tremendously resulted
    to decline in food and nutrient security and environmental quality. They are highly
    dynamic among different agro ecological regions. Most of the problems that cause
    these natural interactions are removal of crop residue, burning of crop residue,
    soil erosion and runoff, gaseous losses of nitrogen and leaching results to nutrient
    depletion; temperature, soil moisture and water saturation, soil texture, topography,
    vegetation and biomass production results to organic matter loss; low rainfall,
    high temperature, high evapotranspiration, inadequate drainage, deforestation,
    intensive cropping and over grazing result to salinity; sodic water, poor drainage,
    and deforestation result to sodicity; weathering and leaching, OM decomposition,
    acid rain, crop production and removal, application of acid forming fertilizer
    result to acidity. Nutrient depletion, organic matter loss, salinity, sodicity,
    and acidity could be managed through the combination of these practices; optimized
    timing and rate of fertility application, optimized use of agrochemical, use of
    organic fertilizer, use of cover crop, use of crop rotation and conservation tillage
    practice, mulching, efficient irrigation, use of tolerant crops, and liming. These
    practices, if effectively implemented will ameliorate the effects of nutrient
    depletion, organic matter loss, salinity, sodicity, and acidity thereby enhancing
    soil fertility for optimum crop production.</strong>
