  title: Assessment of the effects of cassava mill effluent on the soil and its microbiota
    in Biase local government area of Cross river state, Nigeria
  abstract: "The effects of cassava mill effluent (CME) on the soil and soil micro-biota\
    \ was investigated. Soil samples were collected from sites polluted with CME and\
    \ also from an adjacent site not polluted with CME. Standard microbiological methods\
    \ were used in the isolation, antibiotic susceptibility and enumerating the population\
    \ of the microorganisms while the physico-chemical parameters of the soil were\
    \ determined using standard chemical processes. The bacteria isolates were <em>Bacillus\
    \ sp., Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium sp.\
    \ </em>and <em>Proteus sp. a</em>nd the fungal isolates were <em>Aspergillus sp.,\
    \ Candida sp., Mucor sp., Penicillium sp., Saccharomyces sp.</em> and <em>Rhizopus\
    \ sp</em>. The mean aerobic bacterial count for the soil samples ranged from 7.1\xB1\
    0.11x10<sup>5 </sup>cfu/g for the control soil to 8.0\xB10.19x10<sup>5 </sup>cfu/g\
    \ for the CME impacted soil. The mean heterotrophic fungal counts varied from\
    \ 4.7\xB10.41x10<sup>5 </sup>cfu/g for CME impacted soil to 4.2\xB10.57x10<sup>5\
    \ </sup>cfu/g for the control soil. Susceptibility profile showed that <em>Bacillus\
    \ sp. </em>from the CME impacted site had reduced susceptibility to levoflacin,\
    \ amoxil, chloramphenicol, and Ciprofloxacin. <em>Pseudomonas sp.</em> from the\
    \ same site had reduced susceptibility to streptomycin, ampicilin, tarivid, peflacin,\
    \ augmentin and ciprofloxacin.<em> Escherichia coli </em>had reduced susceptibility\
    \ to streptomycin, ampicilin, ciprorex and nalidixic acid. The heavy metals Cu,\
    \ Zn, Ni, Co, and Fe content of the CME impacted soil increased greatly. Excessive\
    \ application of CME had negative effects on the soil, hence the high concentration\
    \ of heavy metals in CME dumpsites and high microbial presence. The study also\
    \ showed that CME can induce the resistance potential of some soil microbes to\
    \ antibiotics and seriously affect the physicochemical parameters of soil."
