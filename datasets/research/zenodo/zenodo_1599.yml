  title: Changes in Bacterial and Fungal Soil Communities in Long-Term Organic Cropping
    Systems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Long-term organic farming aims to reduce synthetic fertilizer
    and pesticide use in order&lt;br&gt;

    to sustainably produce and improve soil quality. To do this, there is a need for
    more information&lt;br&gt;

    about the soil microbial community, which plays a key role in a sustainable agriculture.
    In this&lt;br&gt;

    paper, we assessed the long-term effects of two organic and one conventional cropping
    systems on&lt;br&gt;

    the soil microbial community structure using high-throughput sequencing analysis,
    as well as the&lt;br&gt;

    link between these communities and the changes in the soil properties and crop
    yield. The results&lt;br&gt;

    showed that the crop yield was similar among the three cropping systems. The microbial
    community&lt;br&gt;

    changed according to cropping system. Organic cultivation with manure compost
    and compost tea&lt;br&gt;

    (Org_C) showed a change in the bacterial community associated with an improved
    soil carbon and&lt;br&gt;

    nutrient content. A linear discriminant analysis effect size showed different
    bacteria and fungi as key&lt;br&gt;

    microorganisms for each of the three different cropping systems, for conventional
    systems (Conv),&lt;br&gt;

    different microorganisms such as Nesterenkonia, Galbibacter, Gramella, Limnobacter,
    Pseudoalteromonas,&lt;br&gt;

    Pantoe, and Sporobolomyces were associated with pesticides, while for Org_C and
    organic cultivation&lt;br&gt;

    with manure (Org_M), other types of microorganisms were associated with organic
    amendments&lt;br&gt;

    with different functions, which, in some cases, reduce soil borne pathogens. However,
    further&lt;br&gt;

    investigations such as functional approaches or network analyses are need to better
    understand the&lt;br&gt;

    mechanisms behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;'
