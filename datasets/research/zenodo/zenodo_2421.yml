  title: "Analysis of China\u2019s legislation on soil contamination in the light\
    \ of the realization of an ecological civilization"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;After several years of population growth, urbanization, rapid
    economic and growing depletion of natural resources, China&rsquo;s environmental
    related challenges are nearing a tipping point. Following the ideal of creating
    an ecological civilization, China is on its way to greening socio-economic development.
    In fact, the ecological civilization is the primary conceptual key used by the
    People&rsquo;s Republic of China capable of providing a coherent framework for
    adjustments to socio-economic development in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century
    to allow people to live in health within the eco-environmental boundaries of the
    Earth during the current geological era of the Anthropocene. After delineating
    the features of the ecological civilization, this paper aims to analyze the legal
    regime of contaminated lands in China as outlined by the 2018 Soil Contamination
    Law in the light of making a stable and prosperous ecological civilization. Besides
    that, this paper examines the statutory definition of soil contamination under
    the law describing the environmental legislative frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;'
