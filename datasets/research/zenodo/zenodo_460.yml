  title: Soil Testing and Crop-Suggestion Using Data Mining
  abstract: "Abstract\u2014 Agriculture is the most essential component of Indian\
    \ economic system. To increase yield production, many factors are responsible.\
    \ Data mining plays an important role in agriculture sector. Data mining is the\
    \ process of mining important information from a collection of huge data set and\
    \ transform this into an understandable form for future use. There for the aim\
    \ of this work is to predict soil type by using data mining classification techniques.\n\
    \n\nIn this study, soil dataset containing soil test outcomes has been used to\
    \ apply various classification strategies in data mining. Soil type deals with\
    \ the categorization of soil into specific soil classes as \u201Cvery low\u201D\
    , \u201Clow\u201D, \u201Cmedium\u201D, \u201Chigh\u201D, and \u201Cvery high\u201D\
    \ on the idea of % of nutrient determined within the soil and on the basis of\
    \ these lessons crops are recommended for a soil portion."
