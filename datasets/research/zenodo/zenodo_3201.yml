  title: Impact assessment of the reuse of two discrete treated wastewaters for the
    irrigation of tomato crop on the soil geochemical properties, fruit safety and
    crop productivity
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Advanced tertiary treatment and disinfection technologies have enabled
    the production of wastewater (WW) with quality complying with the established
    criteria for reuse in agriculture. This study assessed the impacts of tomato crop
    irrigation with two qualitatively distinct treated WW effluents, as compared to
    control tubewell water (TW) irrigation, on the soil geochemical properties, tomato
    fruit safety and crop productivity. The treated effluents reused for irrigation
    were produced in two Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (MWTPs) utilizing two
    discrete tertiary treatment and disinfection technologies, i.e. Slow Sand Filtration
    and chlorination (MWTP I), and Membrane Bioreactor and UV radiation (MWTP II),
    respectively. The impacts on soil pH, electrical conductivity, total organic C,
    Cl&minus;, NO3&minus; and heavy metal (Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co) content were evaluated.
    In addition, the heavy metal content in tomato fruits and leaves, as well as the
    microbial load in fruit flesh and peel was determined. Crop productivity was measured
    by the mean fruit weight and maximum diameter, and by the number of fruits per
    harvest. Irrigation with either WW did not significantly affect the soil pH, organic
    C and heavy metal content, as well as crop productivity, in comparison to control
    TW irrigation. Furthermore, the heavy metal content of tomato fruits and leaves
    in all irrigation treatments was found to be below the maximum permissible levels
    set for fruit safety and the critical tissue concentration for phytotoxicity,
    respectively. Moreover, no microbiological contamination (total coliform, fecal
    coliform, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Listeria spp.) of tomato fruits was
    found from any irrigation treatment. Overall, results obtained with regard to
    the parameters examined strongly suggest that advanced tertiary treated effluent
    of good quality might be safely reused, in terms of both environmental sustainability
    and public health safety, for vegetable irrigation, concurrently promoting water
    use efficiency in dry areas.&lt;/p&gt;'
