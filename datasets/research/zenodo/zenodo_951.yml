  title: Development of Geopolymer-Based Cement and Soil Stabilizers for Transportation
    Infrastructure
  abstract: Geopolymer Cement (GPC) has drawn much attention in the recent years as
    an alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) for soil stabilization, pavements,
    bridges and other transportation structures due to their good mechanical properties
    in comparison to OPC. In addition, GPC can be processed at room temperatures from
    aqueous solutions of waste materials (e.g. fly ash) or abundant natural sources
    (e.g. clay), thereby significantly reducing CO2 production associated with processing
    of OPC. As such, GPC proves to be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly
    alternative than OPC. This research explores methods to develop GPC with desired
    properties and evaluate their durability characteristics as part of their long-term
    performance based on real service conditions when exposed to significant water
    intake during flooding or torrential rainfall. Teams from Texas A&amp;M University
    (TAMU) and University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) collaborated in this study to
    understand GPC, propose different methods to synthesize GPC, and to effectively
    synthesize a GPC composition.
