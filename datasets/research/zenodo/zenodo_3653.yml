  title: Behavior of Embankments Constructed on Soft Soil Deposits Reinforced with
    Rigid Inclusions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Large settlement associated with the construction of embankments
    on soft soil deposits is a challenging geotechnical problem that needs a special
    treatment. Reinforcing the embankments utilizing geosynthetics is an effective
    technique used to reduce the differential settlement, while the total settlement
    is unchanged. A more efficient technique is utilizing a combination between soft
    soil reinforcement using piles or rigid inclusions, thus increasing the equivalent
    stiffness of the entire soft soil stratum, and a load transfer layer reinforced
    by one or more layers of geosynthetics on top of the inclusions&#39; head, in
    order to improve the load distribution process between the rigid elements. In
    this paper, the behavior of soft soil deposits reinforced with rigid inclusions
    is studied using three-dimensional finite element analysis, utilizing the &quot;PLAXIS
    3D 2020&quot; software. Verification of the adopted modeling procedures is performed
    by the back analysis of a well-documented case study of a physical laboratory
    scaled model. Results of the numerical model showed a good agreement with the
    laboratory measurements in terms of both the settlement and load distribution
    aspects. Furthermore, results of both the developed numerical model and selected
    performed numerical analyses, from the literature, for the same case study, were
    compared showing better efficiency of the developed model compared to others and
    more consistency with the real behavior of the laboratory model. The verified
    model confirmed the efficiency of increasing the friction angle of the embankment
    on the load transfer mechanism between the rigid inclusions, and hence decreasing
    the resultant settlement.&lt;/p&gt;'
