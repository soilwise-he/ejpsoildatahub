  title: Palm Bunch Ash Effect on Soil Base Saturation and Growth of Cucumber (Cucumis
    Sativus L.)
  abstract: "This study was carried out to assess the effect of Palm Bunch Ash (PBA),\
    \ at various levels (0, 2, 4t/ha) on soil Base Saturation and growth of <em>Cucumis\
    \ sativus L.</em> at the Teaching and Research Farm, Rivers State University,\
    \ Port Harcourt. PBA, and Soil samples (0 \u2013 15cm) before and after application,\
    \ from the experimental plots, were collected and analyzed with standard methods\
    \ for Physico-chemical properties and Base Saturation calculated. A total of 9\
    \ treatments were used with T<sub>0</sub> (Control), T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>4,\
    \ </sub>where T represents PBA as treatment<strong>,</strong> and the subscripts\
    \ 0, 2, and 4 represent the levels. The experiment was a 1x3 factorial in Randomized\
    \ Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replicates. 18 seeds of cucumber (2 per\
    \ hole) from NSPRI, Port Harcourt were planted on each treatment plot of 2 x 2m\
    \ at plant spacing of 45 \xD7 45cm. Thereafter, it was thinned to one (1) per\
    \ hole after emergence. This implies that there were a total number of 10,000\
    \ plants per hectare. Growth parameters include shoot height (cm), 3, 6, and 9WAP,\
    \ and a number of leaves, 3, 6, and 9WAP. Data generated from the field were subjected\
    \ to a one-way ANOVA test using the Minitab package and the means were separated\
    \ using Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference at 95% probability. The results\
    \ revealed that Base Saturation increased (p&lt;0.05) as the treatment level increased\
    \ in the treated soil with the highest 65.96 of 4t/ha. Again, there was a significant\
    \ effect (p&lt;0.05) on shoot height, as the PBA level, increased in treated soil\
    \ with the highest values 13.97 recorded in 2t/ha, and 48.13 and 77.90 recorded\
    \ in 4t/ha for 3, 6, and 9WAP. Similarly, for a number of leaves, the highest\
    \ values were recorded in 4t/ha, also for 3, 6, and 9WAP. Hence, PBA is recommended\
    \ as a good amendment for acid soil neutralizer, Base Saturation booster, and\
    \ nutrient buffer and supplier to the soil and ultimately to plants<em>.</em>"
