  title: The Potential of Jack Bean (Canavalia ensiformis L.) Developed in Suboptimal
    Soil to Succeeding Food Sufficiency
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract :&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The more population grows, the more the food demand required. In this
    case, soybean, due to the less production compared to rice. In order to support
    food self-sufficiency and soybean demands, tropical legumes are cultivated due
    to its nutritional content which is similar to soybean. The local Indonesian plant,
    jack bean has adaptive properties to sub-optimal land. It can adapt to various
    cultivation systems, high productivity, and similarity of nutritional content
    to soybean. It has quite unique adaptations which can grow its upright stems or
    grows vines, depends to the environment, and relatively shorter age than another
    type local bean plants. Jack bean seeds can be further processed into&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;tempeh,&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;powder&lt;em&gt;,
    bakpia&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;(Indonesian traditional sweet cake which using nuts for
    the filling), and various cakes as a substitute for soybean, mung bean, and wheat.
    Therefore, the jack bean plant has a great potential as food self-sufficient Indonesia&rsquo;s
    program.&lt;/p&gt;'
