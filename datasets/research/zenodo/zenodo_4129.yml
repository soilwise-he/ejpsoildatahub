  title: 'Hazardous Impacts of Open Dumpsite of Municipal Solid Wastes on Soil: Case
    of M''Ploussoue Park Dump at Bonoua in Ivory Coast'
  abstract: 'In Ivory Coast, most of the uncontrolled dumpsites are open-air and is
    one of the most common methods adopted. To study the impact of the solid waste
    on soil, soil samples were collected from the dumpsite of M''Ploussoue Park in
    Bonoua. The physical and chemical parameters such as size particle, pH, Exchangeable
    cations, CEC and the contents in heavy metals, were studied using various analytical
    techniques. It has been found that most of all the heavy metals analyzed contents
    exceeds the permissible limits in accordance with CCME soil quality standards.
    It''s conclude that M''Ploussoue Park dumpsite is characterized as polluted site
    whose the contamination is due to the solid waste materials that are dumped in
    the area.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V72018041653 AND DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18483/ijSci.1653'
