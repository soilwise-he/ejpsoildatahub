  title: The Improvement of Selected Soil Chemical Properties Using Singapore Daisy
    Based Compost in Ultisols
  abstract: <em>An acid soil such as Ultisols is the potential for the improvement
    of crop productivity by the application of organic fertilizer. This research aimed
    to compare selected chemical properties of Ultisols as affected by Singapore daisy
    compost at a different time of application. The study took place at the Screen
    House in Pasar Melintang Village, City of Bengkulu, Indonesia, 14 m above sea
    level, assigning Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with two factors. The factors
    were Singapore daisy compost time of application, including one week before planting
    (WBP), 2 WBP, and at planting (AP), and the rate of the compost ranging from 0
    to 10, 20, and 30 tons/ha. The application of Singapore daisy compost two weeks
    before planting exhibited the highest total soil nitrogen of Ultisols. The Singapore
    daisy compost at rates of 20-30 tons/ha significantly increased the chemical properties
    of Ultisols.</em>
