  title: Soil Stabilization Using Waste Materials in Sri Lanka
  abstract: 'The uses of automobiles are increasing day by day because of that the
    waste of tyres increases in Sri Lanka. Safer disposal of rubber tyre waste has
    become a challenging job in Sri Lanka. As a result of the improper way of disposal,
    there is a great damage to eco system like air pollution and aesthetic pollution.
    So that use of their basic properties in engineering applications are become prominent.
    This investigation has focused on the CBR of soil reinforced with randomly mixed
    shredded rubber tyre chips and the results will be compared with unreinforced
    samples. The optimal percentage value of shredded rubber tyre content in soil
    will be determined using the Standard proctor compaction test and CBR test. Increases
    in CBR value significantly reduce the total thickness of the pavement and hence
    the total cost involved in the road projects. H. L. S Sathik | D. De S. Udakara
