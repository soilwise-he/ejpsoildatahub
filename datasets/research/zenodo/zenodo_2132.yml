  title: Relationship between different fractions of N and characteristics of some
    dominant soil series of West Bengal
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur-741 252, Nadia, West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 08 September 2010, revised 05 July 2011, accepted 08 November 2011</em>\
    \ A study was conducted to make a relationship between different forms of inorganic\
    \ and organic N with some important physical and chemical properties of dominant\
    \ soil series of West Bengal. Results revealed that in gene\u2022\xB7al, alluvial\
    \ soil contains higher amount of different forms of N than that of soils of Red\
    \ and Laterite zone. Amongst different forms, exchangeable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>\
    \ and hydrolysable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and amino acid fractions contributed\
    \ more to the total pool of total N. Correlation studies pointed out a significant\
    \ relationship between finer fractions of soils with fixed NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,\
    \ total hydrolysable organic N and total N. Total hydrolysable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>\
    \ is also significantly correlated with C.E.C. of the soils."
