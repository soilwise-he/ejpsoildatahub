  title: VARIATION IN SOIL MACROFAUNA DIVERSITY IN THE DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES IN
    NAMANYONYI SUB COUNTY, MBALE DISTRICT UGANDA.
  abstract: 'This study was conducted in Namanyonyi Sub-county, Mbale district, Uganda.
    It compared: soil macrofauna abundance and diversity, the physicochemical properties
    of the soil, and earthworms and termites variability and biomass vis-?-vis the
    land use types (fallow, mixed cropping and eucalyptus plantation). Each land-use
    type was sampled for soil macrofauna using three methods (monolith, termites transect
    and pitfall traps). Thirteen species of invertebrates spread across 12 orders
    were recorded across the different land use types. The major macrofauna groups
    recorded included: Hymenoptera, Blattodea, Araneae, Orthoptera, Chilopoda, coleopteran,
    Diplopoda, Hemiptera, Dermaptera and pseudo-Scorpionida. Generally, Hymenoptera
    was the most abundant of the macrofauna groups constituting about (64.77%) of
    the total followed by Blattodea (22.69%). The other macrofauna (Araneae, Diplopoda,
    Chilopoda, Orthoptera, Blattidae, Hemiptera, Dermaptera, Mantodea and psudoscorpionida
    each constituted &lt;10% of the total macrofauna recorded. Soil macrofauna was
    more diverse in eucalyptus land use types, followed by fallow and lastly mixed
    cropping. However, the reverse was also true for biomass. Soil chemical characteristics
    did not significantly vary across land use types (ANOVA, P&gt;0.05). Pearson correlation
    showed that there is a moderate positive relationship between macrofauna biomass
    and calcium (r= 0.666. P&lt; 0.05), The findings of this study seem to indicate
    that based on biomass, fallow is a better way of conserving invertebrate macrofauna
    while eucalyptus is the least and calcium levels in the soil determine the presence
    of these organisms.'
