  title: MONITORING 241Pu IN UKRAINIAN SOIL
  abstract: "We collected ca. 500 soil samples from within the inhabited territory\
    \ of the Ukraine for 241Pu determination. To cover the expected wide range of\
    \ contamination levels due to fallout from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP)\
    \ accident, we took samples in the following regions: Kiev (170 samples), Gitomir\
    \ (70 samples), Chernigov (60 samples), Rovno (70 samples), other regions (130\
    \ samples). We used 10 g of soil from a 5-cm depth coring cylinder. We ashed the\
    \ samples for 4 h at 400\xB0C and then used a mixture of HCl and HF followed by\
    \ HNO3 to solubilize the plutonium. We stabilized the plutonium with NaNO3 and\
    \ isolated it using Dowex-1 ion exchange resin. Finally, we deposited the plutonium\
    \ electrochemically onto stainless steel disks. We determined the activities of\
    \ the a-emitting isotopes of plutonium, including the 242Pu yield tracer, using\
    \ traditional a-spectroscopy systems. Our chemical yields were typically 40-80%.\
    \ We used liquid scintillation counting (LSC) for the determination of the 1Pu\
    \ activity on each disk. Our method employs an ultra low-level a/3 spectrometer\
    \ (Quantulus 1220TM), 7-ml aluminium/Teflon\xAE vials and a highlight output,\
    \ toluene based liquid scintillation cocktail (GS-1). The analytical parameters\
    \ were: counting efficiency =15%, background count rate = 0.55 cpm, figure of\
    \ merit (E21 B) = 409, minimum detectable activity (MDA) for 120 min count = 2.3\
    \ Bq kg-1 and the MDA for a 500 min count =1.0 Bq kg-1. Geometric mean values\
    \ and standard deviations for 1Pu activities in soil from the inhabited regions\
    \ which were studied were 20.5\xB1i2.9 Bq kg-1"
