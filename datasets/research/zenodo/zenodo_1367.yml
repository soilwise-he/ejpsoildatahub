  title: Influence of Organic Fertilizer Application on Soil  Nutrients and Yield
    of Cotton
  abstract: "The study was conducted to evaluate the performance of organic fertilizers\
    \ on cotton yield and soil nutrients at Cotton Research Farm of Cotton Development\
    \ Board located at Jagodishpur, Chawgacha, Jashore during the crop growing season\
    \ of 2021 and 2022 using the seeds of genotype CB Hybrid-1 planted in a spacing\
    \ of 90 \xD7 35 cm. The experiment was laid out in a RCBD design with three replications.\
    \ The experimental treatments were consisted of different doses of cow dung and\
    \ processed organic fertilizers of three different sources (a, b and c). The treatments\
    \ were: T1 = control (zero fertilizer), T2 = 10.526 t ha-1 of \_cow dung, T3 =\
    \ 3.571 t ha-1 \_of processed organic fertilizer (a), T4 = 4.225 t ha-1 of processed\
    \ organic fertilizer (b), T5 = 5.0 t ha-1 \_of processed organic fertilizer (c),\
    \ T6 = 1\u20442 cow dung + 1\u20442 recommended fertilizer dose (RFD) of N, P,\
    \ K, S, B, Zn and Mg, T7 = 1\u20442 (a) + 1\u20442 RFD of N, P, K, S, B, Zn and\
    \ Mg, T8 = 1\u20442 (b) + 1\u20442 RFD of N, P, K, S, B, Zn and Mg and T9 = 1\u2044\
    2 (c) + 1\u20442 RFD of N, P, K, S, B, Zn and Mg. The trend of nutrients was smaller\
    \ but increase was observed. The highest increase of total OM, total N, P, K,\
    \ S, Zn and B were 7.89%, 10.0%, 8.27%, 9.09%, 9.0%, 8.81%, 8.33% respectively\
    \ and those were recorded in T5, T2, T6, T3, T7, T7 and T5 treatments respectively\
    \ in the end of second year. The results indicated that the half amount of organic\
    \ fertilizer (b) along with 1\u20442 RFD (T8) produced the maximum seed cotton\
    \ (2.49 t/ha) in 2021. But sole organic fertilizer at the rate of 4.225 t ha-1\
    \ \_(source- b) produced maximum seed cotton (2.51 t/ha) in 2022. Amendment of\
    \ sole cow dung gave maximum BCR of 2.34 and 2.69 in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\
    \ The treatments T3, T6, T7 and T8 might be the optimum treatment on the basis\
    \ of BCR. Application of organic fertilizer with inorganic offers higher yield\
    \ of seed cotton and economic returns with an increase of soil nutrients.\n\n\
