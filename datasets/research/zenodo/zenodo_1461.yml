  title: Effect Of Varying Non Plastic Fines Contents On Undrained Shear Strength
    Of Soil
  abstract: The flow  failures of the alluvial sandy ground cause catastrophic damage
    such as tilting of structures, floating up of structures, permanent later displacement
    of ground. In order to quantify the tendency of flow characteristics of sandy
    soils, a simple and reliable concept of steady state strength approach has been
    used. To evaluate the same, total ten tests are conducted with relative density
    varying as 30% and 45% and for same effective consolidation pressure of 120kPa.
    It was observed that with increase in equivalent granular state parameter the
    residual shear strength reduces till threshold fines content and later on increases.
