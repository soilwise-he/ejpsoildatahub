  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An investigation on the status of available manganese in soil
    and its content in a leaf of the host plant, larva, pupa, excreta, and cocoon
    shell of Tasar silkworm, Antheraea mylitta Drury was undertaken to study the dynamics
    and impact of consumption of manganese in cocoon production. Availabilities of
    Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn in the soil of Tasar rearing plot at Nagri, Ranchi was found
    as 82.79 &plusmn; 9.78 mg/kg, 23.32 &plusmn; 2.96 mg/kg, 0.83 &plusmn; 0.202 mg/kg,
    and 0.68 &plusmn; 0.097 mg/kg, respectively. Manganese is adequately available
    in the soil, but its contents in leaf, larva, litter, pupa, and cocoon shell vary
    remarkably. The content of manganese in the leaf of Terminalia tomentosa was found
    in the range of 50&ndash;100 ppm which was optimum for the success of the crop.
    Excess consumption of Mn by the larva of Tasar silkworm resulted in the failure
    of the crop yielding 2 cocoons/dfl when reared on Shorea robusta which has Mn
    content in the range of 353 ppm&ndash;2543 ppm. Daily requirement of manganese
    in optimum level for healthy development of Tasar silkworm larva of Daba bivoltine
    Eco Race was calculated to be in the range of 0.007&ndash;0.035, 0.018&ndash;0.36,
    0.045&ndash;0.090, 0.099&ndash;0.198, and 0.354&ndash;0.708 mg for 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
    4th, and 5th instars, respectively. Manganese content in a leaf of Shorea robusta
    (Sal) indicated that its translocation capacity compared to Terminalia arjuna
    (Arjun) and T. tomentosa (Asan) is very high which is detrimental for the health
    of Tasar silkworm of Daba bivoltine Eco Race.&lt;/p&gt;'
