  title: Estimated contamination risk of heavy metals (Ni and Zn) of a soil grown
    (Cucumis Melo) on industrial activity zone (El-Hadjar - Annaba - Algeria)
  abstract: Our study, conducted in the industrial area of El-Hadjar (Annaba), aims
    to assess the impact of heavy metals on an agricultural soil and vegetation (melon)
    just outside the steel complex. The assessment to cover the total contents, exchangeable
    and soluble. These metals were measured in the surface soil (0-20 cm) and long
    (20-40 cm) and the melon sheets. The results obtained confirm the presence of
    two elements (Zn and Ni) in all samples analyzed (soil and vegetation). The total
    zinc measured in the soil is in relatively more by contribution to nickel. As
    for the soluble and exchangeable contents, Ni s is more important than Z
