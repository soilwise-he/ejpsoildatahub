  title: 'Interactions Between Soil, Horizontal Heat Exchangers And Environment: The
    Iter Project Outcomes'
  abstract: The thermal properties of soils can be considered one of the most important
    parameters for many engineering projects designing. In detail, the thermal conductivity
    plays a fundamental role when dimensioning ground heat exchangers, especially
    very shallow geothermal (VSG) systems, interesting the first 2 m of depth from
    the ground level. However, the determination of heat transfer in soils is difficult
    to estimate, because depends on several factors, including, among others, particle
    size, density, water content, mineralogy composition, ground temperature, organic
    matter. The performance of a VSG system, as horizontal collectors or special forms,
    is strongly correlated to the kind of sediment at disposal and suddenly decreases
    in case of dry-unsaturated conditions in the surrounding soil. Therefore, a better
    knowledge of the relationship between thermal conductivity and water content is
    required for understanding the VSG systems behavior in saturated and unsaturated
    conditions. The overall aim of ITER Project (Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal
    ground heat exchangers), funded by European Union, is to ensure the sustainability
    of VSG systems. To enhance the performance of horizontal geothermal heat exchangers,
    thermally enhanced backfilling material (TEBM) have been tested in laboratory
    and monitored on site. In the test field the interactions between different soil
    mixtures, helix collectors installed in horizontal trenches and the surrounding
    environment have been studied. Analysis of data collected over more than one year
    have been processed and used in numerical simulations in order to understand the
    short and long term environmental impact of these technical solutions
