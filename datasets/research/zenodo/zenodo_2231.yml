  title: "Activity of the compost Bio Vegetal\xAE in containing the soil-borne pathogen\
    \ Verticillium dahliae Kleb."
  abstract: "<em>Verticillium dahliae</em> Kleb. is a widely distributed soilborne\
    \ pathogen, causing vascular wilt diseases in over 400 host plants and resulting\
    \ in severe damage annually in different parts of the world. The pathogen survives\
    \ in the soil for many years by producing<br> melanised, thick-walled resting\
    \ structures, called microsclerotia, which are resistant to environmental extremes\
    \ and remain associated with organic and soil particles. The disease is difficult\
    \ to control, due to production of microsclerotia and the localization of the\
    \ pathogen within the xylem vessels during its parasitic phase. In the past, the\
    \ control of Verticillium wilt has relied on soil fumigation, but the use of methyl\
    \ bromide, the main soil fumigant, was banned due to its devastating impact on\
    \ the environment and soil living organisms. Currently, control is based mainly\
    \ on preventive methods, and integrated disease management strategy. Among the\
    \ different means available, the application of compost shows less or null detrimental\
    \ impact on the environment. Besides the suppressive effect against plant diseases,\
    \ composts improve soil health and structure, and stimulate the growth of soil\
    \ microbiota. Bio Vegetal\xAE is a fertilizer already available on the market\
    \ and used as soil improver. Its source matrices are organic municipal wastes\
    \ and green pruning residues, whose composting process is triggered by mesophilic\
    \ and thermophilic microorganisms.<br> The objective of this work was to evaluate\
    \ the activity of the commercial compost Bio Vegetal\xAE on the soil-borne pathogen\
    \ <em>V. dahliae</em>, by <em>in vitro</em> tests, on conidia and on microsclerotia,\
    \ and <em>in vivo</em> experiments, using both soil with and without host plants<br>\
    \ (tomato and/or olive). Inoculum density of <em>V. dahliae</em> microsclerotia\
    \ occurring in the soil treated with Bio Vegetal\xAE at different doses, either\
    \ transplanted or not with tomato or olives, showed significantly lower values\
    \ as compared to the untreated control. Similarly, results from i<em>n vitro</em>\
    \ test indicate a significant reduction of microslcerotia germination in the treatments\
    \ amended with filter-sterilized aqueous extract of the compost Bio Vegetal. Further\
    \ researches are in progress to determine the effect of Bio Vegetal\xAE on the\
    \ soil microbial community."
