  title: "Determination of Nutrition Status of Leaf and Soil Samples of Olive (Olea\
    \ Europaea L.) Trees in Alt\u0131n\xF6z\xFC District of Hatay"
  abstract: "In order to determine the nutritional status of olive orchards in Hatay-Alt\u0131\
    n\xF6z\xFC district, texture, lime (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), pH, electrical conductivity\
    \ (EC), organic matter and some macro-micro nutrient element analyzes were performed\
    \ on 30 soil and 15 plant samples taken from selected olive orchards. According\
    \ to the results obtained from the research, the soils were found to be in clay\
    \ and clay-loam texture class, with slightly alkaline reaction, unsalted, excessively\
    \ calcareous and insufficient in organic matter. it was determined that all the\
    \ soils were insufficient in nitrogen (N), except for one sample, 100.0% zinc\
    \ (Zn) and boron (B), 6.66% phosphorus (P), 13.33% potassium (K), 10.0% iron (Fe)\
    \ contents. In the olive leaf samples, 20% N, 6.66% P, 36.66% K, 53.33% calcium\
    \ (Ca), 73.33% magnesium (Mg), 46.66% both manganese (Mn), It was determined that\
    \ it was deficient in terms of Zn and B contents. In the study, when soil and\
    \ leaf analyze are examined, some plant nutrients are sufficient or more (Ca,\
    \ Mg) in the soil, while they are deficient in the plant. Some plant nutrients\
    \ are deficient in the soil (Zn, B), but they are found to be sufficient in the\
    \ plant. This shows that there are nutritional problems and unconscious soil and\
    \ leaf fertilization is done in the region. As a result, it is suggested that\
    \ the producers should make fertilization programs by a specialist according to\
    \ the missing or excess plant nutrient element status by having plant and soil\
    \ analyzes done."
