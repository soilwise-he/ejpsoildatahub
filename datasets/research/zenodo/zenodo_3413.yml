  title: Modelling Of Soil Structure Interaction Of Integral Abutment Bridges
  abstract: 'Integral Abutment Bridges (IAB) are defined as

    simple or multiple span bridges in which the bridge deck is cast

    monolithically with the abutment walls. This kind of bridges are

    becoming very popular due to different aspects such as good

    response under seismic loading, low initial costs, elimination of

    bearings, and less maintenance. However the main issue related to

    the analysis of this type of structures is dealing with soil-structure

    interaction of the abutment walls and the supporting piles. Various

    soil constitutive models have been used in studies of soil-structure

    interaction in this kind of structures by researchers. This paper is an

    effort to review the implementation of various finite elements model

    which explicitly incorporates the nonlinear soil and linear structural

    response considering various soil constitutive models and finite

    element mesh.'
