  title: Influence of Soil Properties on Interactions of Pesticides with Soils
  abstract: "Division of Soils and Crop Management. Central Sod Salinity Research\
    \ lnstitute, Karnal-132 001 AE-829. Salt Lake City. Calcutta\xB7 700 064 <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 10 November 1994, revised 12 July 1995, accepted 30 August 1995</em>\
    \ Freundlich equation has been used to characterise the adsorption or metacid\
    \ (methy1 parathion) and sumithion (fenitrothion) on soils (untreated) and soils\
    \ free or organic matter (O.M.) and sesquioxides. Stepwise multiple regression\
    \ analysis shows that organic matter and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> content of\
    \ untreated soils largely (99.9%) control adsorption ( <em>K</em> value) of metacid\
    \ while the organic matter, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and clay content account\
    \ mainly (99.4%) adsorption (K value) of sumithion. Among the other soil properties,\
    \ specific surface area is found to contribute significantly in variation of adsorption\
    \ of metacid and sumithion by untreated and treated soils. The adsorption of pesticids\
    \ is temperature-dependent and exothermic in nature. Evaluation of thermodynamic\
    \ parameters Indicate~ the physical nature of adsorption. The irreversible nature\
    \ of adsorption is revealed from desorption study and shows hysteresis. Percent\
    \ desorption values indicate an inverse relation with organic matter content of\
    \ the soils (untreated)."
