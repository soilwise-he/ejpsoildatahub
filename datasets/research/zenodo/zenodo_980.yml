  title: Heavy Metal Content of Cocoa Plantation Soil in East Kolaka, Indonesia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Investigations of pH and heavy metals contents of Pb, Cd, Ni,
    Cu, and Zn in cocoa plantations&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

    soil of East Kolaka has been conducted by using pH starter Ohaus 3000 and Atomic
    Absorption&lt;br&gt;

    Spectroscopy (AAS) Shimadzu AA6300. Based on the investigation, it is known that
    acidic soil&lt;br&gt;

    plantation with pH ranges between 4.45 to 6.26, and also contains Pb, Cd, Ni,
    Cu, and Zn with an&lt;br&gt;

    average concentration (mg/kg) are 1.45, 0.02, 0.85, 0.77, and 1.49, respectively.
    The existence of&lt;br&gt;

    Pb and Cd in plantation soil have been exceeded the WHO permissible, whereas Ni,
    Cu, and Zn is&lt;br&gt;

    still within the permissible limits. Acidic soil plantation will give opportunity
    metal ions such as Pb2+,&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

    Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+&nbsp;absorbed by plants. Thus causing the accumulation
    in plant tissues&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

    and make the cocoa plants stress of heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;'
