  title: Soil conditions and sheltering techniques improve active restoration of degraded
    Nothofagus pumilio forest in Southern Patagonia
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;forests in the\
    \ Southern Patagonia region of Chile are highly degraded because of clearing for\
    \ human settlements, extensive livestock grazing, and more recently, the impact\
    \ of coal mining operations. Most of these legacy areas have remained as extensive\
    \ meadows of non-native grasses and legumes with limited&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus\
    \ pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;forest recovery due to dry soil moisture conditions\
    \ and exposure to high wind and solar radiation. Therefore, active reforestation\
    \ is needed to reclaim&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;forests\
    \ from abandoned grassland or disturbances caused by surface mine operation. In\
    \ this study, a surface coal mine operation and an abandoned meadow established\
    \ in the 1950\u202Fs needed to be restored back to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;N. pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;forest\
    \ on Riesco Island, in Southern Chilean Patagonia. We compared the establishment\
    \ success of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;seedlings on replicated\
    \ blocks under two conditions (experimental treatments): (i) four blocks of meadow\
    \ previously disturbed by livestock grazing, (MS), and (ii) four blocks where\
    \ a deep layer of the soil profile was removed, mixed, and then replaced simulating\
    \ recommendations used for reclaiming surface coal mines (RS). To improve&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus\
    \ pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;establishment and protection at each block under both\
    \ soil conditions, seedlings were planted both unprotected and protected from\
    \ wind and solar radiation using four different types of shelters: shade cloth,\
    \ irregular log piles, white polypropylene shelters, and woody branches. Soil\
    \ physical and chemical properties, seedling survival and growth, leaf water potential,\
    \ and stomatal conductance were measured. Results at the end of the first and\
    \ fourth growing seasons showed better conditions for seedling growth in the RS\
    \ treatment. Mean survival rates began to be different following the second growing\
    \ season with values of 84.7\u202F&plusmn;\u202F2.9% in RS and 60.2\u202F&plusmn;\u202F\
    3.2% survival in MS treatments, respectively. At the end of the study, the difference\
    \ between the treatments was even geater with values of 75.4\u202F&plusmn;\u202F\
    5.5% and 32.2\u202F&plusmn;\u202F7.1%. Soil removal and replacement significantly\
    \ changed soil physical properties, but values were still adequate for vegetation\
    \ development. The use of shelters significantly influenced four-year survival\
    \ rates of seedlings planted on the disturbed MS treatment with 60\u202F&plusmn;\u202F\
    8.2% survival in plastic shelters and less than 25.5\u202F&plusmn;\u202F6.5% for\
    \ all other shelters. The effects of the shelters were less clear in the RS treatment.\
    \ Our study showed that&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nothofagus pumilio&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;restoration\
    \ on abandoned grassland and reclaimed mine sites in Patagonia is a feasible option\
    \ when soil conditions and planting techniques improve soil water availability,\
    \ and when seedling are protected against excessive solar radiation and wind.&lt;/p&gt;"
