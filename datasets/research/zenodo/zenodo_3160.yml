  title: Integrating satellite-based passive microwave and optically sensed observations
    for evaluating spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation health in the red soil region
    of southern China
  abstract: This upload file is the data and code of the two methods that used in
    the article "Integrating satellite-based passive microwave and optically sensed
    observations for evaluating spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation health in the
    red soil region of southern China".The first is Theil-Sen estimator and MK monotonic
    method, which has been applied to acquire the overall trends.The second is The
    MK rank statistic method that used to locate the specific time and dicrection
    for abrupt changes.
