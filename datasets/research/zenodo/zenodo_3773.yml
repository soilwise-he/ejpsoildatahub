  title: Evaluation Of Shear Strength Parameters Of Rudsar Sandy Soil Stabilized With
    Waste Rubber Chips
  abstract: The use of waste rubber chips not only can be of great importance in terms
    of the environment, but also can be used to increase the shear strength of soils.
    The purpose of this study was to evaluate the variation of the internal friction
    angle of liquefiable sandy soil using waste rubber chips. For this purpose, the
    geotechnical properties of unmodified and modified soil samples by waste lining
    rubber chips have been evaluated and analyzed by performing the triaxial consolidated
    drained test. In order to prepare the laboratory specimens, the sandy soil in
    part of Rudsar shores in Gilan province, north of Iran with high liquefaction
    potential has been replaced by two percent of waste rubber chips. Samples have
    been compressed until reaching the two levels of density of 15.5 and 16.7 kN/m<sup>3</sup>.
    Also, in order to find the optimal length of chips in sandy soil, the rectangular
    rubber chips with the widths of 0.5 and 1 cm and the lengths of 0.5, 1, and 2
    cm were used. The results showed that the addition of rubber chips to liquefiable
    sandy soil greatly increases the shear resistance of these soils. Also, it can
    be seen that decreasing the width and increasing the length-to-width ratio of
    rubber chips has a direct impact on the shear strength of the modified soil samples
    with rubber chips.
