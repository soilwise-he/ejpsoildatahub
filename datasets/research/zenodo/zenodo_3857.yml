  title: DYNAMIC SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION ANALYSIS OF HIGH-RISE BUILDING SUPPORTED
    ON FINNED PILE-MAT FOUNDATION
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> In a process known as Soil-Structure Interaction
    (SSI), the motion of the structure is impacted by the soil reaction and vice versa.
    It has been believed that SSI enhances a building's capacity to respond to earthquakes.
    In order to transfer building loads from shallow soil strata with poor bearing
    capacity to deeper soil strata with high bearing capacity and stiffness, pile
    foundations are often employed. Compared to vertical loads, lateral loads are
    often only partially resisted by piles. Thus, it is also necessary to enhance
    the lateral load bearing capability of piles. In general, fins make the pile more
    rigid, which helps piles to resist greater lateral stresses than the typical approach.
    It is exceedingly challenging to fully understand the behavior of fin piles using
    conventional soil pile theories since they have various fin configurations. The
    purpose of the current study is to understand how regular pile mats (RP-Mat) and
    finned pile mat foundations with different fin lengths of 6m &amp; 18m behave
    under saturated and unsaturated soil conditions when they are subjected to 1940
    El-Centro earthquake ground motion. The three-dimensional Finite element analysis
    ABAQUS 6.17 software was used to model these foundations. At various floor levels,
    the peak acceleration, storey lateral displacement and Inter-storey drift values
    are compared for both fin lengths under different soil conditions. Results of
    the study showed that when compared to RP mat, using a finned pile mat proved
    more effective in decreasing the structural response. A better performance with
    respect to reducing the seismic effects on the building and improving its stiffness
    was observed when the fin length was increased Further, the 0.6Lp is proved to
    be the effective fin length which were shown satisfactory performance when compared
    to other fin lengths.
