  title: 'On the Fixed Rainfall Intensity: Effects on Overland Flow Resistance, Shear
    Velocity and on Soil Erosion'
  abstract: "Raindrops and overland flow both are erosive parameters but they do not\
    \ act by the same way. The overland flow alone tends to shear the soil horizontally\
    \ and concentrates into rills. In the presence of rain, the soil particles are\
    \ removed from the soil surface in the form of a uniform sheet layer. In addition\
    \ to this, raindrops falling on the flow roughen the water and soil surface depending\
    \ on the flow depth, and retard the velocity, therefore influence shear velocity\
    \ and Manning\u2019s factor. To investigate this part, agricultural sandy soil,\
    \ rainfall simulator and a laboratory soil tray of 0.2x1x3 m were the base of\
    \ this work. Five overland flow depths of 0; 3.28; 4.28; 5.16; 5.60; 5.80 mm were\
    \ generated under a rainfall intensity of 217.2 mm/h. Sediment concentration control\
    \ is based on the proportionality of depth/microtopography. The soil loose is\
    \ directly related to the presence of rain splash on thin sheet flow. The effect\
    \ of shear velocity on sediment concentration is limited by the value of 5.28\
    \ cm/s. In addition to this, the rain splash reduces the soil roughness by breaking\
    \ the soil crests. The rainfall intensity is the major factor influencing depth\
    \ and soil erosion. In the presence of rainfall, the shear velocity of the flow\
    \ is due to two simultaneous effects. The first, which is horizontal, comes from\
    \ the flow and the second, vertical, is due to the raindrops."
