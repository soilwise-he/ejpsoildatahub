  title: Rapid Determination of Soil Class Based on Visible-Near Infrared, Mid-Infrared
    Spectroscopy and Data Fusion
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Wise soil management requires detailed soil information, but
    conventional soil class mapping in a rather coarse spatial resolution cannot meet
    the demand for precision agriculture. With the advantages of non-destructiveness,
    rapid cost-efficiency, and labor savings, the spectroscopic technique has proved
    its high potential for success in soil classification. Previous studies mainly
    focused on predicting soil classes using a single sensor. In this study, we attempted
    to compare the predictive ability of visible near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra,
    mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, and their fused spectra for soil classification. A
    total of 146 soil profiles were collected from Zhejiang, China, and the soil properties
    and spectra were measured by their genetic horizons. Along with easy-to-measure
    auxiliary soil information (soil organic matter, soil texture, color and pH),
    four spectral data, including vis-NIR, MIR, their simple combination (vis-NIR-MIR),
    and outer product analysis (OPA) fused spectra, were used for soil classification
    using a multiple objectives mixed support vector machine model. The independent
    validation results showed that the classification model using MIR (accuracy of
    64.5%) was slightly better than that using vis-NIR (accuracy of 64.2%). The predictive
    model built on vis-NIR-MIR did not improve the classification accuracy, having
    the lowest accuracy of 61.1%, which likely resulted from an over-fitting problem.
    The model based on OPA fused spectra performed best with an accuracy of 68.4%.
    Our results prove the potential of fusing vis-NIR and MIR using OPA for improving
    prediction ability for soil classification.&lt;/p&gt;'
