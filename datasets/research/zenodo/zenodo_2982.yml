  title: Evaluation Of The Effect Of Lime And Cement On The Engineering Properties
    Of Selected Soil In A University In Southwestern Nigeria.
  abstract: Soil stabilization means alteration of the soils properties to meet the
    specified engineering requirements. Methods for the stabilization are compaction
    and use of admixtures. Lime and Cement was commonly used as stabilizer for altering
    the properties of soils. This project focuses on the effect of Cement and Lime
    on selected engineering properties of lateritic soils in Ladoke Akintola University
    of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria. In order to study this effect, fresh laterite
    was obtained and tested for its index and geotechnical properties. Afterwards,
    the soil sample was altered with additives proportions which includes 0%, 2.5%,
    5%, 7.5%, and 10% of both cement and lime replacement by dry weight. On examination
    laterite, it was discovered that the laterite can be classified as good. After
    carrying out the engineering properties on the sample, it was observed that the
    maximum dry density reduced with increase in the lime content and for cement content
    at 2.5 and 10% but increases at 5-7.5%. Also, the optimum moisture content increased
    for increasing lime content and fluctuates for increasing cement content. However,
    an increase in the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) was noticed for increase in
    cement but a low effect for lime addition. It was therefore concluded that lime
    and cement modifies the chemical property of the tested soil with cement the most
    suitable.
