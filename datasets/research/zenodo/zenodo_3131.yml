  title: 'Assessment of soil erosion by SLEMSA model using remote sensing and GIS:
    A case study of Taung Watershed of Ramotswa Agricultural District in Botswana'
  abstract: "The Soil Loss Estimation Model for Southern Africa (SLEMSA) model integrated\
    \ with Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) was positively\
    \ validated to spatially assess soil erosion risk in the Taung Watershed of Ramotswa\
    \ Agricultural District during the period 2000 \u2013 2020. The estimated annual\
    \ soil erosion averaged 11.77 and 12.57 t/ha/year in 2000 and 2020, respectively.\
    \ The Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and topography were found to be key determinants\
    \ of high soil erosion risk when using SLEMSA. The soil erosion assessment tools\
    \ enabled prioritization of high erosion prone areas in the study area for soil\
    \ conservation planning and watershed management."
