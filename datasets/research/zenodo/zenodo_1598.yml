  title: Occurrence, abundance and distribution of soil nematodes associated with
    groundnut farming in Kenya
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Groundnut is a major cash crop grown in tropical and subtropical
    regions. In Kenya, groundnut is mostly grown in the Western and Nyanza regions
    and has been ranked the fourth cash crop of the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB). However,
    groundnut production in Kenya has continued to decline with farmers attaining
    less than 50 % of the yield potential of 700 to 1400 kg/ha. Yearly statistical
    reports by&lt;br&gt;

    Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA), Nuts and Oil Crops Directorate for the last
    seven years, show the decline has been consistent. In 2019/2020 AFA reported there
    was a decrease of 216 Mt in Homa Bay and 30 Mt in Kisumu. Yield loss is attributed
    to lack of quality improved seed and pests&rsquo; infestation during growth and
    storage. Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are the major pests of groundnut worldwide.
    This study sought to investigate the occurrence of nematode communities (PPN and
    non-parasitic nematodes (NPN) in soils cultivated with groundnuts in the LVB and
    to determine the effect of farmyard manure application on their presence. Six
    peanut varieties (4 improved and 2 local) were cultivated in Nyakach and Karachuonyo
    in March to August in 2021 and 2022. Soil samples, groundnut roots and pods were
    collected. A modified Baermann&rsquo;s, maceration methods and filtration technique
    was used to isolate nematodes from the soil, groundnut pods and roots. Multi-stage
    Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine any significant differences
    in abundance and richness while the Shannon index compared diversity of PPN and
    NPN among the farms in two seasons and regions. Eleven genera of PPN: Aphelenchoides,
    Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, Helicotylenchus, Tylenchus, Scutellonema, Trichodorus,
    Hemicycliophora, Tylenchorhynchus, Rotylenchulus and Criconema. spp., and three
    genera of NPN; Rhabdittes, Dorylaimus spp. and Predators were categorized. Aphelenchoides
    and Meloidogyne were the most abundant PPN and Rhabdites NPN in both regions and
    seasons. Application of farm yard manure led to decline of abundance of PPN and
    an increase in NPN. The results confirm the presence of PPN in the LVB groundnut
    growing regions and the potential use of farm yard manure in their management.
    This study recommends further investigation on actual damage potential of these
    PPN and their management&lt;br&gt;

    strategies.&lt;/p&gt;'
