  title: Long-term impacts of organic and conventional farming on the soil microbiome
    in boreal arable soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Long-term effects of organic and conventional farming systems
    in parallel on the microbiota of boreal arable soil&lt;br&gt;

    from forage and cereal crop fields were investigated. Microbial activity was measured
    as basal respiration and&lt;br&gt;

    microbial biomass C and N were determined by fumigation extraction. Microbial
    abundance was determined by&lt;br&gt;

    gene copy numbers from bacterial and archaeal specific 16S rRNA genes and the
    fungal ITS2 region with&lt;br&gt;

    quantitative PCR. Microbial community composition for soil bacteria and fungi,
    including arbuscular mycorrhiza,&lt;br&gt;

    were conducted by amplicon sequencing with richness assessed from OTU reads. We
    detected changes in&lt;br&gt;

    both bacterial and fungal community composition between the farming systems. Microbial
    activity and biomass&lt;br&gt;

    C and N were higher in the organic system for cereal crop rotation compared to
    the respective conventional&lt;br&gt;

    system. In the autumn, organic systems had higher microbial richness. As fungi
    were more abundant in the&lt;br&gt;

    autumn, they may be responsible for both higher microbial activity and C sequestration
    in their biomass after&lt;br&gt;

    harvesting, especially in the organic system for cereal crop rotation. Also, crop
    type and cow manure explained&lt;br&gt;

    changes in fungal community composition. The typical bacterial community of the
    organic system for cereal crop&lt;br&gt;

    rotation included many soil and plant health promoting bacterial groups. Fungi
    benefiting from organic farming&lt;br&gt;

    practices, other than manure, may include endophytic taxa with a variety of functions
    as well as pathogenic and&lt;br&gt;

    mycotoxin producing species. Overall, the results suggest that farming practices
    typical of organic farming, such&lt;br&gt;

    as use of green manure and continuous plant cover have induced changes in the
    soil microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;'
