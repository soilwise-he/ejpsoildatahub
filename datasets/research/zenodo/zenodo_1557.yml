  title: Influence Of Calcium Chloride On Index Properties And Cbr Value Of Clayey
    Soil
  abstract: "Most of the problem faced by geotechnical engineers is when a given site\
    \ does not have suitable engineering properties to support structures, roads and\
    \ foundation. The soil of the site may be weak due to various reasons. A difficult\
    \ problem in work exists when the soil is found to be clay or the water table\
    \ in that region is high. Soils with high clay content generally have low shear\
    \ strength and has tendency to swell when their moisture content is allowed to\
    \ increase. For these reasons clayey soil is not suited for structures, roads\
    \ and foundation. Engineering properties of clayey soil can be improved by adopting\
    \ different methods of soil stabilization. \n\n \n\nMany stabilization methods\
    \ are in practice for altering the engineering properties of the clayey soil.\
    \ Common methods for stabilization of clayey soil are lime and cement stabilization.\
    \ Soil can also be stabilized by chemical stabilization as well as physical stabilization.\
    \ Physical stabilization includes dynamic compaction and chemical stabilization\
    \ is done by using chemically active materials such as lime, fly ash, Portland\
    \ cement, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium silicate, magnesium chloride\
    \ or materials having elastic properties such as bitumen.\n\n \n\nCalcium chloride\
    \ is the ionic compound of calcium and chloride. A recent study shows that calcium\
    \ chloride can be effectively dissolves in water quickly and provide enough calcium\
    \ ions for exchange ionic reactions with clayey soil. Function of this chemical\
    \ (calcium chloride) is to form into cluster of fine particles and bind them together.\n\
    \nCalcium chloride dosage is added in 0.5% to 3.0% by weight of soil with 0.5%\
    \ of increment in each dosage. Standard proctor test, CBR, consistency limits\
    \ test and UCS test are performed to determine the optimum dosage of calcium chloride."
