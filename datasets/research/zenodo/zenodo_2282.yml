  title: 'Flow Through Porous Medium. Part-VI : Permeability Studies of Water and
    Ammonium Salt Solutions Through Soil Membrane'
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, Himachal Pradesh University, Simla-171 005 <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 30 April 1981, revised 14 September 1981, accepted 10 December 1981</em>\
    \ The phenomenological permeation coefficients for water and aqueous solutions\
    \ of ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate at different concentrations\
    \ and at 35\xB0 were determined for a soil membrane of known thickness and water\
    \ content. The results have been interpreted in terms of the principles of non-equilibrium\
    \ thermodynamics. It has been found that the permeation coefficient for water\
    \ is than that of the ammonium salt solutions. Frictional coefficient between\
    \ membrane matrix and water has been evaluated and its dependence upon the solute\
    \ concentration has also been discussed. The effect of concentration of the electrolyte\
    \ solution on the radius of pore of the membrane equilibrated with the electrolyte\
    \ solution has also been discussed."
