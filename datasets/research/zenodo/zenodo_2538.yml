  title: Effects of Aged Oil Sludge on Soil Physicochemical Properties and Fungal
    Diversity Revealed by High-Throughput Sequencing Analysis
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The oilfield soil was contaminated for years by large quantities of
    aged oil sludge generated in the petroleum industry. In this study, physicochemical
    properties, contents of main pollutants, and fungal diversity of the aged oil
    sludge-contaminated soil were analyzed. Results revealed that aged oil sludge
    significantly changed physical and chemical properties of the receiving soil and
    increased the contents of main pollutants (petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals)
    in soil. Meanwhile, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing by Illumina
    Miseq platform at each taxonomic level demonstrated that the toxicological effect
    of oil pollutants obviously influenced the fungal diversity and community structure
    in soil. Moreover, it was found that the presence of three genera (Cephalotheca,
    Lecanicillium, and Septoriella) appeared in aged oil sludge-contaminated soil.
    And oil pollutants promoted the growth of certain genera in Ascomycota (70.83%)
    and Basidiomycota (10.78%), such as Venturia, Alternaria, and Piloderma. Nevertheless,
    the growth of Mortierella (9.16%), Emericella (6.02%), and Bjerkandera (0.00%)
    was intensively limited. This study would aid thorough understanding of microbial
    diversity in oil-contaminated soil and thus provide new point of view to soil
    bioremediation.&lt;/p&gt;'
