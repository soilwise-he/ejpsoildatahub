  title: Financial Efficiency and Intergenerational Equity of Soil and Water Conservation
    Measures in Kenya
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The present study, conducted in Upper Tana, Kenya, has the objective
    of assessing viability and profitability of structural and non-structural soil
    and water conservation measures among smallholder farmers. Financial cost benefit
    analysis (FCBA) framework was used to analyse primary data collected from 433
    smallholder farmers in Upper Tana. Similarly, a review of methodological experiences
    and challenges in assessing benefits accruing from conservation measures to future
    generations was also conducted. Structural and non-structural conservation measures
    studied were financially attractive with bench terraces and Napier grass strips
    attaining higher net present values than other structural and non-structural measures
    studied respectively. The gross margins of the conservation measures were also
    positive in the year of study. Labour and materials were the major inputs required
    for establishing and maintaining conservation measures. However, farmers needed
    a conducive institutional framework and land use policies, technical advice and
    support, favourable input-output market and credit to invest on conservation measures
    on a sustainable basis. Analysis at 15, 30, 60 and 90 year time horizons and at
    different discount rates (10%, 12% and 14%) using FCBA indicated that the higher
    the discount rate, the less were the streams of benefits. Similarly, a longer
    period of analysis at a constant discount rate resulted in marginal benefits bringing
    into question the application of conventional FCBA to intergenerational equity
    assessments and whether it is appropriate to conduct analyses at 60 and 90 year
    time horizons using FCBA. Reviews of methodologies for assessing conservation
    benefits to future generations indicated divided opinions on use of discount rates
    and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;'
