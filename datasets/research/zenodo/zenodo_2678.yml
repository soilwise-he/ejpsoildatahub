  title: Analysis of the relationship between the Socio-Economic Characteristics of
    Rice Farmers and Soil Management Practices in Abuja, Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> The study examined the\
    \ analysis of the relationship between the Socio-Economic Characteristics of Rice\
    \ Farmers and Soil Management Practices in Abuja. The study was conducted in rural\
    \ communities in Abuja, Nigeria. Two objectives guided the study. The study adopted\
    \ descriptive and logistic regression research design. Multistage sampling technique\
    \ was employed to select the farming communities for the study. Twelve (12) agricultural\
    \ wards (Chuwkuku, Gaube, Bamushin, kotunku, Pai, Dafa, Bako, Dobi, Paso, Chibiri,\
    \ Gadabiu and Paikon) were randomly selected giving a total of thirty-six (36)\
    \ agricultural wards. Five blocks were randomly picked from each of the agricultural\
    \ wards making the total of 180. Lastly two (2) circles were randomly selected\
    \ from each of the blocks resulting to three hundred and sixty (360) respondents\
    \ who were randomly selected from the chosen circles. The results show that 58.06%\
    \ of the respondents were male while 36.13% of the respondents were between the\
    \ ages of 30 and 39years. Also, 47.74% of them were married with 40% of the respondents\
    \ having an average of 5 people in their households. 61.94 had at most a national\
    \ certificate of education (NCE). Majority (44.84) of the respondent had a farm\
    \ size of between half a hectare and two hectares. The study recommended that\
    \ manual tillage should be mostly carried out by rice farmer to improve the level\
    \ of production and also soil rotation should be practiced where soil is much\
    \ available to reduce the level of degradation."
