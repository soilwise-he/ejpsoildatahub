  title: Importance of soil and plant community disturbance for establishment of Bromus
    tectorum in the Intermountain West, USA
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The annual grass Bromus tectorum has invaded millions of hectares\
    \ in western North America and has transformed former perennial grass and shrub-dominated\
    \ communities into annual grasslands. Fire plays a key role in the maintenance\
    \ of B. tectorum on the landscape but the type of disturbance responsible for\
    \ initial invasion is less well understood. We conducted an experiment in a perennial\
    \ shrub/grass/forb community in eastern Idaho, USA to examine the roles of plant\
    \ community and soil disturbance on B. tectorum emergence and establishment prior\
    \ to state-changing fires. Our experiment consisted of a plant community disturbance\
    \ treatment where we (1) removed the shrub component, (2) removed the grass/forb\
    \ component, or (3) removed all shrubs, grasses, and forbs. We followed this treatment\
    \ with seeding of B. tectorum onto the soil surface that was (1) intact, or (2)\
    \ disturbed. Each experimental plot had an associated control with no plant community\
    \ disturbance but was seeded in the same manner. The experiment was replicated\
    \ 20 times in two sites (high and low aboveground biomass). We measured emergence\
    \ by counting seedlings in late spring and establishment by counting, removing,\
    \ and weighing B. tectorum individuals in mid-summer. We also examined the influence\
    \ of plant community disturbance on the soil environment by measuring extractable\
    \ NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\u2013\
    \ four times each summer. Soil disturbance greatly influenced the number of B.\
    \ tectorum individuals that emerged each spring. Plant community disturbance,\
    \ specifically disturbance of the grass/forb component, increased N availability\
    \ in the late growing season and biomass of B. tectorum the following summer.\
    \ We conclude that soil disturbance and plant community disturbance interact to\
    \ promote the initial invasion of B. tectorum in Intermountain West valley ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;"
