  title: Plastic debris impairs archaeal abundance in sub-saharan soil
  abstract: 'Microplastic is ubiquitous in soils. The Sub-Saharan environment is largely
    under-represented in terrestrial plastisphere research despite high levels of
    plastic contamination and demonstrated effects of plastic on fungal communities,
    i.e. enrichments of pathogenic fungi on plastic in Sub-Saharan Kenya. Thus, it
    is of particular interest to investigate the effects of plastic debris in this
    region on the prokaryotic soil microbiome and the resulting consequences. To study
    plastic effects on prokaryotic microbiomes, soil and terrestrial plastic debris
    were analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Investigation of the microbiome
    revealed a strong negative plastic effect on the abundance of Archaea especially
    on the family Nitrososphaeraceae (ammonia oxidizers). In contrast, Sphingomonadaceae
    and multiple Bdellovibrionaceae were indicative for the plastisphere. Matching
    of amplicons with the PlasticDB database for microbial plastic degraders and PICRUSt
    predictions provided further information about the functional capacities of examined
    plastisphere microbiomes such as the depletion of archaeal pathways. In addition,
    we used the 16SPiP database to annotate sequenced bacterial candidates to potential
    pathogenic bacteria, revealing the abundance of more than 15 potential pathogens
    in soil and plastisphere. The combined data shows a modification of the plastisphere
    relative to the soil microbiome, suggests plastic effects on archaeal nitrogen
    transformation potentials and stimulates further research on specific mechanisms
    of plastic-Archaea interactions. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/427491/document'
