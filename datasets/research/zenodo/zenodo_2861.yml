  title: 'Screening of Soil and Sheep Faecal Samples for Predacious Fungi: Isolation
    and Characterization of the Nematode-Trapping Fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora'
  abstract: "Over one-year period, 150 pasture soil samples and 138 sheep faecal samples,\
    \ collected from different parts of Iran were screened for the presence of nematophagous\
    \ fungi. The samples were cultured at 25\xBAC on chloramphenicol-2% water agar\
    \ (CHF-WA) plates in the presence of Haemonchus contortus third stage larvae (L3)\
    \ and checked over a two-month period for characteristic conidia, conidiophores\
    \ and hyphal traps of nematophagous fungi. Suspected nematophagous fungi were\
    \ isolated by periodic transfer of the fungi on CHF-WA plates using the agar block\
    \ method. Overall, 11 soil samples were found to harbour the nematode-trapping\
    \ fungus Arthrobotrys from which 3 pure isolates were made and consequently identified\
    \ as Arthrobotrys oligospora IRAN 877 C, IRAN 878 C and IRAN 879 C. Nematophagous\
    \ fungi were not found in any tested sheep faecal samples. The predatory capacity\
    \ of the isolates was tested against H. contortus infective larvae and then compared\
    \ to reference strains A. oligospora CBS 111.37, A. oligospora CBS 251.82 and\
    \ Duddingtonia flagrans CBS 583.91. The local strains of A. oligospora reduced\
    \ the development of H. contortus L3 by 75-85%, whereas, the predatory capacity\
    \ of reference A. oligospora and D. flagrans strains was measured in the range\
    \ of 51- 85% compared to the fungus free controls. Study of the effect of temperature\
    \ on predatory activity of A. oligospora strains IRAN 877 C and CBS 111.37 revealed\
    \ a reduction of more than 95% in infective larvae of H. contortus at temperature\
    \ levels between 15 to 25\xBAC. This reduction was significantly decreased to\
    \ 30% and 50% at 10\xBAC and 30\xBAC, respectively. The nematode-trapping fungus\
    \ A. oligospora is reported from soil of Iran for the first time and its potential\
    \ role in biocontrol of gastrointestinal nematodes of ruminants is discussed."
