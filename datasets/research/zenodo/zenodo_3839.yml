  title: Estimating the Soil Erosion Crop Factor (C) With Open Sources Geographical
    Information System (GIS) Software
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT


    Soil erosion is one of the most important problems affecting agricultural productivity.
    The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is the most popular empirical-based
    model used globally for erosion estimation and control. Remote Sensing (RS) and
    Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques have become important tools as
    they evaluate erosion at larger scales due to the required amount of data and
    wider area coverage. In this study, the Crop factor (C), which is one of the important
    elements of RUSLE equation with CORINE 2018 database in Tekirdag province, was
    determined by using GIS techniques. Using the open source QGIS 3.14 software in
    the Regulated Universal Soil Loss Equation, topography in the region can be determined
    as a function of soil texture, land use, land cover, precipitation erosion, crop
    management and their application. Crop (C) factor of RUSLE varies between %0.27-%64.69
    under Tekirdag conditions.'
