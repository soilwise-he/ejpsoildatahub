  title: Influence of Nanozeolite Particles on Improvement of Clayey Soil
  abstract: The problem of soil stabilization has been one of the important issues
    in geotechnical engineering. Nowadays, nanomaterials have revolutionized many
    industries. In this research, improvement of the Kerman fine-grained soil by nanozeolite
    and nanobentonite additives separately has been investigated using Atterberg Limits
    and unconfined compression test. In unconfined compression test, the samples were
    prepared with 3, 5 and 7% nano additives, with 1, 7 and 28 days curing time with
    strain control method. Finally, the effect of different percentages of nanozeolite
    and nanobentonite on the geotechnical behavior and characteristics of Kerman fine-grained
    soil was investigated. The results showed that with increasing the amount of nanozeolite
    and also nanobentonite to fine-grained soil, the soil exhibits more compression
    strength. So that by adding 7% nanozeolite and nanobentonite with 1 day curing,
    the unconfined compression strength is 1.18 and 2.1 times higher than the unstabilized
    soil. In addition, the failure strain decreases in samples containing nanozeolite,
    whereas it increases in the presence of nanobentonite. Increasing the percentage
    of nanozeolite and nanobentonite also increased the elasticity modulus of soil.
