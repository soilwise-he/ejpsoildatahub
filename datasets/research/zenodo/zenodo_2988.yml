  title: The Effect Of A Sawdust Alkaline Extract Introduced To Activated Sludge On
    The Biological Activity Of Its Liquid Fraction In Soil Irrigation.
  abstract: "The studies show that a liquid fraction of activated sludge produced\
    \ from a mixture of activated sludge with a sawdust alkaline extract can be used\
    \ in soil irrigation as a plant growth stimulator without dilution. Germination\
    \ energy increased by 6%, germination capacity \u2014 by 11%, a number of seeds\
    \ with high germination power \u2014 by 11%, biological activity of the fraction\
    \ \u2014 by 19.3%. A liquid fraction produced from the mixture of activated sludge\
    \ + 0.5% sawdust alkaline extract was found to be the most effective one for irrigation.\
    \ 5 litres per tonne (1 m3) were found to be sufficient to increase the biological\
    \ activity of the activated sludge liquor."
