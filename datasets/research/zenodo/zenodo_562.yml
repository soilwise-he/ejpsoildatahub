  title: Soil, Earth and People - Our Care and Responsibility
  abstract: "The article discusses the relationship between soils, land modern man\
    \ and his concern and responsibility for sustainable land management. The main\
    \ problems, which limit the rational use and protection of land are analyzed and\
    \ also on the first place among them the improper and unfair distribution of fertile\
    \ soils and lands, and the resulting problems on a different nature \u2013 geographic,\
    \ demographic, ecological, food consumption and social onece The significance\
    \ of the triadic paradigms \"soil-land-people\", \"capital-labor-science\" and\
    \ \"wisdom-harmony-prosperity\" is noted as well as the maxims that oblige us\
    \ to work on them. It is also emphasized that soils in Bulgaria are subject to\
    \ natural, anthropogenic and technogenic pressures. Problems are outlined which\
    \ are related to arable land, recommendations, guidelines and critical assessments\
    \ of the soil scientists and the European institutions (European Parliament and\
    \ European Commission on Agriculture and Development of Rural Areas) concerning\
    \ the organization and management of soil and land resources."
