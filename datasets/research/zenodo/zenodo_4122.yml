  title: Poultry Manure and Its Derived Biochar as a Soil Amendment for Newly Reclaimed
    Sandy Soils under Arid and Semi-Arid Conditions
  abstract: Sandy soils under arid and semi-arid conditions are characterized by poor
    physical and biochemical properties such as low water retention, rapid organic
    matter decomposition, low nutrients use efficiency, and limited crop productivity.
    Addition of organic amendments is crucial to develop soil properties and consequently
    enhance nutrients use efficiency and lessen organic carbon decomposition. Two
    years field experiments were developed to investigate the feasibility of using
    poultry manure and its derived biochar integrated with different levels of N fertilizer
    as a soil amendment for newly reclaimed sandy soils in Western Desert of El-Minia
    Governorate, Egypt. Results of this research revealed that poultry manure and
    its derived biochar addition induced pronounced effects on soil moisture content
    at saturation point, field capacity (FC) and consequently available water. Data
    showed that application of poultry manure (PM) or PM-derived biochar (PMB) in
    combination with inorganic N levels had caused significant changes on a range
    of the investigated sandy soil biochemical properties including pH, EC, mineral
    N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic N (DON) and quotient DOC/DON.
    Overall, the impact of PMB on soil physical properties was detected to be superior
    than the impact of PM, regardless the inorganic N levels. In addition, the obtained
    results showed that PM and PM application had the capacity to stimulate vigorous
    growth, nutritional status, production levels of wheat and sorghum, and to increase
    soil organic matter content and N uptake and recovery compared to control. By
    contrast, comparing between PM and PMB at different levels of inorganic N, the
    obtained results showed higher relative increases in both grain and straw yields
    of wheat in plots treated with PM than in those treated with PMB. The interesting
    feature of this research is that the biochar derived from PM increased treated
    sandy soil organic carbon (SOC) 1.75 times more than soil treated with PM itself
    at the end of cropping seasons albeit double-applied amount of PM. This was attributed
    to the higher carbon stability of biochar treated sandy soils increasing soil
    persistence for carbon decomposition in comparison with PM labile carbon. It could
    be concluded that organic manures applied to sandy soils under arid and semi-arid
    conditions are subjected to high decomposition and mineralization rates through
    crop seasons. Biochar derived from organic wastes considers as a source of stable
    carbon and could be very hopeful choice for substituting easily decomposable organic
    manures under arid conditions. Therefore, sustainable agriculture and productivity
    in newly reclaimed sandy soils desire one high rate addition of biochar derived
    from organic manures instead of frequent addition of such organic amendments.
