  title: "Effects of Water\u2014Binder Ratio on Strength and Seismic Behavior of Stabilized\
    \ Soil from Kongshavn, Port of Oslo"
  abstract: "In many civil engineering problems, soil is stabilized by a combination\
    \ of binders and water. The success of stabilization is evaluated using seismic\
    \ tests with measured P-wave velocities. Optimization of process, laboratory testing\
    \ and data modelling are essential to reduce the costs of the industrial projects.\
    \ This paper reports the optimized workflow of soil stabilization through evaluated\
    \ effects from the two factors controlling the development of strength: (1) the\
    \ ratio between water and binder; (2) the proportions of different binders (cement/slag)\
    \ were changed experimentally in a mixture of samples to evaluate the strength\
    \ of soil. The experimental results show an optimal combination of 30% cement\
    \ and 70% slag with a binder content of 120 kg/m3 and a maximum water binder ratio\
    \ (w/b) of 5. Such proportions of mixture demonstrated effective soil stabilization\
    \ both on a pilot test scale and on full scale for industrial works. The correlation\
    \ between the compressive strength and relative deformation of specimens revealed\
    \ that strength has the highest values for w/b = 5 and the lowest for w/b = 7.\
    \ In case of high water content in soil and wet samples, the condition of a w/b\
    \ \u2264 5 will require a higher amount of binder."
