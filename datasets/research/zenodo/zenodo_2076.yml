  title: Soil Morphological Properties, Classification, Suitability and Capability
    Classification on Dabora-Yelwa Toposequence, Adamawa State, Northeastern Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to assess soil morphological properties,\
    \ soil classification, suitability and capability classification on Dabora-Yelwa\
    \ toposequence with the view of improving soil management practices and increase\
    \ the productive capacity of the farmers of the study area. Soil sampling units\
    \ were delineated using GIS and the study area was categorized into 3 different\
    \ slope positions on the toposequence and each slope position was recognized as\
    \ a sampling unit. Two soil types were identified and classified into Typic Plinthustalfs\
    \ (Yelwa and Sangba\u2019a respectively) and Psammentic Paleudalfs (Dabora). Generally,\
    \ structural development increased along the slope from upper slope to the bottom\
    \ slope position. Capability classification resulted in the upper slope: as C3\
    \ (IIIse) with limitations in texture and erosion hazards while the soils at the\
    \ lower slope resulted in class C2 (IIsw). Suitability classification indicated\
    \ that these soils were moderately suitable for sorghum at the upper slope while\
    \ maize was marginally suitable with limitation in drainage. Measures such as\
    \ land leveling, afforestation and use of cover crops will reduce the effect of\
    \ erosion at the upper slope position.&lt;/p&gt;"
