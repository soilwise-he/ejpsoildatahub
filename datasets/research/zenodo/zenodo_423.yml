  title: Multi-scale evaluation of soil functional indicators for the assessment of
    water and soil retention in Mediterranean semiarid landscapes
  abstract: 'Ecosystem monitoring and assessment are often based on functional indicators,
    which provide integrated and yet simple and affordable measures of key ecosystem
    functions. The landscape function analysis (LFA) assesses ecosystem functioning
    through three indices that represent basic soil functions: surface stability,
    infiltration, and nutrient cycling. Given the high scale-dependency of hydrological
    and erosion processes in semiarid ecosystems, the validation of the stability
    and infiltration indices requires a multi-scale approach, which has not been applied
    by previous works. Using records from a four-year monitoring of a semiarid landscape
    in SE Spain, we evaluated the LFA infiltration and stability indices against quantitative
    measurements of water and sediment flows at multiple scales. At the finest scale,
    the indices correctly reflected the higher infiltration and lower sediment production
    of plant patches as compared with bare-soil interpatches. The infiltration index
    also captured the spatial variation in the infiltration capacity of bare-soil
    interpatches. At the hillslope scale, total runoff was inversely related to the
    average infiltration index for bare-soil interpatches, but it was not related
    to the global infiltration index, which combines the values from both bare-soil
    interpatches and plant patches. These results suggest that the hydrological response
    of semiarid hillslopes depends mainly on the variation in the functioning of bare-soil
    interpatches. Total sediment yield from the hillslope plots was not related to
    the stability index. At the catchment scale, both the bare-soil interpatch and
    the global infiltration indices correctly captured the variability in total runoff
    produced by three micro-catchments of comparable size. The bare-soil infiltration
    index predicted bare-soil infiltration rate and hillslope runoff better than common
    simple indicators of soil functioning such as soil organic carbon, stone cover,
    crusted bare-soil cover, bulk-density and plant cover, and exhibited a similarly
    high indicatory potential that a variety of plant spatial-pattern indicators.
    In contrast to the multi-scale validation of the infiltration index, the indicatory
    potential of the stability index was only proved for the most contrasting soil
    conditions in the study site, pointing to a lower sensitivity of this latter index.'
