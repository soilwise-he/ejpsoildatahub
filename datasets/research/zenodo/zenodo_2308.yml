  title: 'The impact of spatial variability in soil nitrogen and the value in its
    management: A case study'
  abstract: "Variable rate nitrogen (VRN) management strategies seek to optimise the\
    \ nitrogen (N) supply to match crop demand, both to maximise farmer profitability\
    \ and minimise environmental risks. Despite potential benefits, there has been\
    \ comparatively little work looking at the value proposition underpinning VRN.\
    \ Gridded soil samples from a cropping paddock in Hawke\u2019s Bay, New Zealand,\
    \ were characterised for residual mineral N and a bioassay used to quantify N\
    \ mineralisation potential. These data were used in APSIM, a systems model, to\
    \ estimate production outcomes under three different N management strategies in\
    \ an irrigated and non-irrigated maize cropping system. Predictions showed that\
    \ yield was comparable between management scenarios, while VRN resulted in lower\
    \ residual soil N at harvest for both irrigated and non-irrigated systems. While\
    \ these results are for a single paddock, they demonstrate that in this circumstance\
    \ the implementation of VRN significantly improved environmental outcomes without\
    \ impacting gross margins."
