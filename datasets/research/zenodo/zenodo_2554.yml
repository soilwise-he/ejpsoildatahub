  title: Soil fauna modulates the effect of experimental drought on litter decomposition
    in forests invaded by an exotic pathogen
  abstract: '&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Litter decomposition is a fundamental process for nutrient cycling and
    C fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Multiple factors such
    as environmental conditions, litter quality and decomposer organisms are known
    to influence this ecological process in direct and indirect ways. However, it
    remains poorly understood to what extent this entangled bank of complex interactions
    can be disrupted by several global change drivers such as climate change and invasive
    species.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Here we reported main findings from a litter decomposition experiment
    conducted in a natural mixed forest invaded by&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi,&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;an
    exotic oomycete well known for causing tree disease and forest decline. In two
    Mediterranean forest types (namely woodland and closed forest), we first built
    a rainfall exclusion infrastructure to reduce natural precipitation by 30%. Then,
    we followed the spatial variation in C and N leaf litter dynamics as well as the
    abundance of the exotic oomycete&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;for
    18&nbsp;months under both control and rainfall exclusion conditions using a litter
    bag methodology with different mesh sizes to further evaluate the indirect role
    of mesofauna abundance and diversity in litter C and N temporal dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Significant reductions in soil moisture produced by the experimental
    rainfall exclusion increased C litter loss with time directly, and indirectly
    via increases in overall mesofauna abundance and changes in the ratio between
    predators and decomposers. N litter dynamics were in contrast modulated mainly
    by initial litter quality. Surprisingly,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P. cinnamomi&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;abundance
    did not correlate with variation in initial litter quality as previously suggested,
    but we found that the exotic oomycete was negatively correlated with both decomposer
    and predator abundances. These results suggest it might participate indirectly
    in litter decomposition dynamics through the biotic soil component.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;. Contrary to expected, our results show
    that a moderate but realistic rainfall reduction can accelerate the litter decomposition
    process. It also points out to litter fauna as a key component modulating the
    indirect impacts of global change drivers on litter decomposition.&lt;/li&gt;
