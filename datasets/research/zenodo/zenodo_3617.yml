  title: Contribution Of Root Respiration To Soil Respiration In Sugarcane Plantation
    In Thailand
  abstract: The understanding on the contribution of root respiration to total soil
    respiration is still very limited, especially for sugarcane. In this study, trenching
    experiments in sugarcane plantations were conducted to separate and investigate
    soil respiration for this crop. The measurements were performed for the whole
    growing period of 344 days to quantify root respiration. The obtained monitoring
    data showed that the respiration rate is increasing with the age of the plant,
    accounting for up to 29% of the total soil respiration before harvesting. The
    root to soil respiration ratio increased rapidly during the young seedling stage,
    i.e. first five months, then declined and finally got stabilized during yield
    formation and ripening stages, respectively. In addition, the results from the
    measurements confirmed that soil respiration was positively correlated with soil
    moisture content.
