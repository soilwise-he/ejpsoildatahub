  title: Effects of Organic Matter and Live Plants on Sulfidic Soil pH, Redox and
    Sulfate Content under Flooded Conditions
  abstract: In an undisturbed state below the water table, the sulfidic soils are
    benign, unless exposed due to various natural processes or anthropogenic activities
    and sulfuric acidity is produce, which has negative impacts on the environment.
    This paper examines the effects of organic matter, organic matter co-existing
    with live plants or live plants alone on sulfidic soil pH, redox and sulfate content
    under flooded conditions. In almost all cases, organic matter without plants induced
    ameliorative effects on sulfidic soil chemistry. In soils with or without organic
    matter, presence of plants led to higher Eh values, lower pH and higher sulfate
    contents. The reduction reactions of the added organic matter and the anoxia created
    by flooding were ineffective in reducing the amount of oxygen that was pumped
    into the rhizophore via the arenchymatous tissues in all the soils with plants.
    Under falling soil moisture regimes, e.g. during a drought event, presence of
    this type of plant species would aerate the reduced soil conditions. Aeration
    would then lead to oxidation of sulfides, producing sulfuric acid, which in turn
    would have negative impacts when released into the environment. One strategic
    option to reduce the amount of oxygen entering the soil would be to slash the
    shoots and leave them on the surface to help generate more alkalinity upon decomposition,
    even if the culm would continue to facilitate oxygen transport.
