  title: The Impact of Perennial Covers on Soil Microbiome and Nutrient Dynamic
  abstract: Our study discusses the impact of different cropping practices on soil
    health indicator and crop yield. The combination of no fertilization and perennialization
    enhanced soil health indicators and crop yield compared to conventional tillage
    annual crop fallow. The results showed that excessive nitrogen fertilization increases
    soil bulk density, while perennialization with no fertilizer added improves it.
    Higher carbon content was recorded under corn cultivation, but higher carbon-to-nitrogen
    ratio was shown in perennial covers. The study highlights the benefits of adopting
    perennial crops without fertilization for soil health and suggests improved management
    practices for sustainable agriculture. Our finding is particularly significant
    as it suggests an alternative approach to farming that improve soil health while
    reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizer. It provides valuable insights for
    farmers, policymakers, and researches enabling them to make informed decisions
    and implement practices that support both productivity and environmental stewardship,
    Overall, it underscores the importance of responsible fertilizer use and improved
    management practices for maintaining soil fertility and promoting sustainable
    agriculture system.
