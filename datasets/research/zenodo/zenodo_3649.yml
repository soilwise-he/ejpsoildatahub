  title: Selection Of Rayleigh Damping Coefficients For Seismic Response Analysis
    Of Soil Layers
  abstract: One good analysis method in seismic response analysis is direct time integration,
    which widely adopts Rayleigh damping. An approach is presented for selection of
    Rayleigh damping coefficients to be used in seismic analyses to produce a response
    that is consistent with Modal damping response. In the presented approach, the
    expression of the error of peak response, acquired through complete quadratic
    combination method, and Rayleigh damping coefficients was set up and then the
    coefficients were produced by minimizing the error. Two finite element modes of
    soil layers, excited by 28 seismic waves, were used to demonstrate the feasibility
    and validity.
