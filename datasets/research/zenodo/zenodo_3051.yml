  title: The Migration of Organic Chlorine Pesticide Residues in the Composition of
    the Soil Samples from Mirzaabad, Gulistan and Boyovut Districts of Syrdarya Region
  abstract: "&lt;h4&gt;Abstract :&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thin layer chromatography\
    \ gas chromatography ECD detector was employed to evaluate soil samples and wheat\
    \ stalks collected during the spring season for the presence of chlorine organic\
    \ pesticides, namely DDT, DDE, DDD, HCH alpha, and gamma isomers. The study revealed\
    \ that the uppermost concentration of pesticides is constrained within the depth\
    \ interval of 0\u201310(20) cm, with their infiltration extending to a depth of\
    \ 2.0\u20132.5 m. The initial investigation focused on examining the dynamics\
    \ and movement of OCP, including substances such as DDT, DDD, DDE, alpha HCH,\
    \ and gamma HCH, throughout the Syrdarya region. This page provides an overview\
    \ of organochlorine pesticides, their residual presence, their application in\
    \ agricultural regions, and the constituent makeup of wheat stalks. In April 2023,\
    \ a collection of samples was obtained from several districts within the Syrdarya\
    \ region. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a total of 15\
    \ samples. The gas chromatography technique with an electron capture detector\
    \ (GC/ECD) was employed for the investigation of organic chlorine insecticides.\
    \ The isolation and quantification of organic chlorine insecticides with low to\
    \ medium polarity were achieved using a capillary column.&lt;/p&gt;"
