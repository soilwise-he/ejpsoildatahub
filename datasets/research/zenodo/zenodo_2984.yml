  title: STUDIES ON THE RHIZOSPHERIC SOIL FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH NEPETA CATARIA L.
    AND RUMEX DENTATUS L. IN DISTRICT KULGAM OF KASHMIR VALLEY
  abstract: Plants get all types of nutrients from the soil either by the direct assimilation
    of nutrients from the soil or through various other pathways like their association
    with bacteria and fungi. Rhizospheric soil fungi and their association, isolation,
    identification and characterization with two plants viz Nepeta cataria L. and
    Rumex dentatus L. have been analysed. The fungi isolated from the rhizosphere
    soil of Nepeta cateria are Rhizopus stolonifer, Pencillium notatum, Pencillium
    sp. and Aspergillus niger. While the fungi isolated from rhizosphere of Rumex
    dentatus are Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus niger and Pencillium notatum. Among
    these fungi the highest frequency was of Pencillium sp. (100%) in case of Nepeta
    cateria followed by Rhizopus stolonifer (80%), Penicillium notatum (60%) and Aspergillus
    niger (60%). While in case of Rumex dentatus, the highest frequency was observed
    in both Rhizopus stolonifer (100%) and Pencillium notatum (100%) followed by Aspergillus
    niger (80%)
