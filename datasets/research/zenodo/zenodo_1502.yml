  title: Soil invertebrates of coniferous forests along a gradient of air pollution
    (Komi Republic)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The role of soil invertebrates in the cycle of substances, soil-forming
    processes and the provision of ecosystem services is undeniable. Therefore, soil
    invertebrates are valuable in bioindication studies. Comprehensive research of
    soil invertebrates in the production area of Mondi Syktyvkar JSC as the largest
    pulp and paper enterprise in the European part of Russia was initiated in 2003.
    A huge amount of data about composition, abundance and structure of soil macro-
    and mesofauna along an impact gradient was accumulated during the period from
    2003 to 2019 years. These data can be used to study local biodiversity, monitor
    the state of soil invertebrate communities and assess the impact of the pulp and
    paper industry on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datasets here presented include
    information from a monitoring programme for soil invertebrates that inhabit coniferous
    forests in the production area of Mondi Syktyvkar JSC (Komi Republic). The assemblages''
    structure of macrofauna, collembolans and nematodes are described. Information
    on the number of individuals of springtail species, nematodes genera and macrofauna
    taxa is given. A total of 11146 sampling events of macrofauna, 6673 sampling events
    of Collembola, and 2592 sampling events of Nematoda are recorded along a gradient
    of air pollution from pulp and paper industry emissions.&lt;/p&gt;'
