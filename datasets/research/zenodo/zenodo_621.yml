  title: Soil Classification Using Image Processing and Modified SVM Classifier
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Recently the use of soil classification has gained more and
    more importance and recent direction in research works indicates that image classification
    of images for soil information is the preferred choice. Various methods for image
    classification have been developed based on different theories or models. In this
    study, three of these methods Maximum Likelihood classification MLC , Sub pixel
    classification SP and Support Vector machine SVM are used to classify a soil image
    into seven soil classes and the results compared. MLC and SVM are hard classification
    methods but SP is a soft classification. Hardening of soft classifications for
    accuracy determination leads to loss of information and the accuracy may not necessary
    represent the strength of class membership. Therefore, in the comparison of the
    methods, the top 20 compositions per soil class of the SP were used instead. Results
    from the classification, indicated that output from SP was generally poor although
    it performs well with soils such as forest that are homogeneous in character.
    Of the two hard classifiers, SVM gave a better output than MLC. Priyanka Dewangan
