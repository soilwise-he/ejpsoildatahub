  title: COMPOSITION AND GERMINATION CAPABILITY OF WEED SEED BANK IN THE SOIL UNDER
    MAIZE
  abstract: "Monitoring of quantitative and qualitative properties of weed species\
    \ seeds in the arable soil layer is one of the most efficient methods for prediction\
    \ of weed occurrence in the field. It provides better herbicide choice, as well\
    \ as their timely application. In 2011 and 2012 in two localities with similarly\
    \ applied agricultural practice in maize crop, weed seed bank was studied in the\
    \ arable soil layer up to 30 cm of depth. In the first locality, seeds of 12 weed\
    \ species were separated. Of these species, the most numerous<br> were seeds of\
    \ Polygonum lapathifolium and Sinapis arvenis at all studied depths, and the greatest\
    \ quantity was found at the depth of 20-30 cm. The greatest number of all remaining\
    \ evidenced weed species was also found at this depth. In the other locality seeds\
    \ of even 15 weed species was separated, but only seeds of Amaranthus retroflexus\
    \ occurred in greater quantity at all studied layers. In average, for all species,\
    \ the greatest number of seeds was found in the deepest layer, but statistically\
    \ significant differences were not<br> recorded in number of seeds per soil depth.\
    \ After determination of the separated weed seeds followed their germination in\
    \ climatic chamber. The highest germination percentage of 70-80% was recorded\
    \ for weed species Sinapis arvensis at locality \u017Dabalj. At locality Zmajevo,\
    \ the highest germinatin was established for weed species Amaranthus retroflexus\
    \ and Chenopodium album."
