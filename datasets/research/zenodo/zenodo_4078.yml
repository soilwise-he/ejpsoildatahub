  title: Study On The Effect Of Sulphur, Glucose, Nitrogen And Plant Residues On The
    Immobilization Of Sulphate-S In Soil
  abstract: In order to evaluate the relationship between the sulphur (S), glucose
    (G), nitrogen (N) and plant residues (st), sulphur immobilization and microbial
    transformation were monitored in five soil samples from 0-30 cm of Bastam farmers
    fields of Shahrood area following 11 treatments with different levels of Sulphur
    (S), glucose (G), N and plant residues (wheat straw) in a randomized block design
    with three replications and incubated over 20, 45 and 60 days, the immobilization
    of SO4 -2-S presented as a percentage of that added, was inversely related to
    its addition rate. Additions of glucose and plant residues increased with the
    C-to-S ratio of the added amendments, irrespective of their origins (glucose and
    plant residues). In the presence of C sources (glucose or plant residues). N significantly
    increased the immobilization of SO4 -2-S, whilst the effect of N was insignificant
    in the absence of a C amendment. In first few days the amounts of added SO4 -2-S
    immobilized were linearly correlated with the amounts of added S recovered in
    the soil microbial biomass. With further incubation the proportions of immobilized
    SO4 -2-S remaining as biomass-S decreased. Decrease in biomass-S was thought to
    be due to the conversion of biomass-S into soil organic-S. Glucose addition increased
    the immobilization (microbial utilization and incorporation into the soil organic
    matter) of native soil SO4 -2-S. However, N addition enhance the mineralization
    of soil organic-S, increasing the concentration of SO4 - 2-S in soil.
