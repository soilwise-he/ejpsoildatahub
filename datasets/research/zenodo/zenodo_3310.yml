  title: Soil Moisture Sensed Automatic Irrigation System
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT


    Improving irrigation efficiency can contribute greatly to reducing production
    costs of crops, making the agriculture industry more competitive and sustainable.
    Through proper irrigation, average plant yields can be maintained (or increased)
    while minimizing environmental and other impacts caused by excessive application
    of water and subsequent agrichemical leaching. Many years ago, irrigation had
    to be done manually and it involved a lot of labour and material costs. However,
    recent technological advances have made soil water sensors available for efficient
    and automatic operation of irrigation systems. Automatic soil moisture sensor-based
    irrigation seeks to maintain a desired soil water range in the root zone that
    is optimal for plant growth. This report therefore illustrates how by using an
    automatic soil moisture sensor based irrigation system, the issue of water wastage,
    agrichemical wastage and time spent on irrigation can be effectively tackled without
    adversely affecting crop yield, leading to optimal irrigation and ultimately an
    optimal agricultural system as a whole. Here we make use of an Arduino microcontroller
    interfaced with a soil moisture sensor. The microcontroller triggers an electronic
    valve ON or OFF based on readings taken from the soil moisture sensor. The model
    used here is miniaturized for the purpose of demonstration. It can however be
    implemented on a larger scale as in a farm or garden to reap its full benefits.'
