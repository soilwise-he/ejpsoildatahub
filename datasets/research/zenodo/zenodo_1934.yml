  title: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY OF PHYSICAL, MECHANICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
    IN BASIC SOIL CULTIVATION
  abstract: Qualitative softening of compacted soil and weed control is the main purpose
    of tillage. Soil softening improves the physical and mechanical properties of
    the soil, the water, air, heat and nutrient regimes, also improves the activity
    of various beneficial micro-organisms, accelerates the breakdown of organic matter,
    nutrients in the form are easily absorbed by plants and are formed in the soil.
    In the following years, the focus of agricultural specialists and farmers has
    been on the rational and efficient use of land resources and the production of
    quality crops. This requires important measures, such as improving the reclamation
    of irrigated land, reducing soil salinity and preventing erosion.
