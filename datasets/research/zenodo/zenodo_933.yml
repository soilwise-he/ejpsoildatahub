  title: Fauna of the Soil Protozoa of the Northern-East Azerbaijan
  abstract: In this paper investigation results of ciliates and testate amoebae biodiversity
    in the forest and cultivate soils of Northern-East Azerbaijan are given. 135 species
    of the soil ciliates and 91 species of the testate amoebae were found. 16 species
    of ciliates and 11 species of testate amoebae were first reported for the Caucasus
    fauna. The vertical distribution of species richness and general quantity of the
    free-living ciliates and testate amoebae in the different soils of several regions
    of the Northern-East Azerbaijan were carried out. Its disposition can be used
    as express method for evaluation the quality of native and cultivate soils.
