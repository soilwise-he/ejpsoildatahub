  title: Long Term of Cattle Manure Amendments and its Impact on Triticale (X. Triticosecale
    Wittmack) Production and Soil Quality
  abstract: 'Organic amendment is a good alternative to improve soil fertility to
    maintain or increase crop forage and grain production. After several times of
    organics application (crop cycles) is important to follow soil physical and chemical
    parameters to avoid soil pollution such as salinity and nitrate. The main objective
    of this study was to maintain good triticale forage production and soil quality
    after seven years in plots where two factor were studied:caw manure amendments;
    0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 t ha -| and one chemical level with 150-100-00 kg ha-1
    of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and potassium, respectively just to compare manure amendments.
    After This time to decrease soil salinity and high levels of nitrate triticaleforage
    was planted in the same plots using two varieties without manure and chemical
    fertilizer application. Triticale variables measured were green forage and soil
    parameters such as; Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Matter (OM), Hydrogenpotential
    (Ph) and Nitrates (NO-3). Results indicated that triticale forage production was
    high in all plots were caw manure was applied after three years than the control
    and chemical fertilizer level, Also, the chemical soil parameters such as salinity,
    and nitrate decrease to adequate levels of 4 mmhos cm -1 in salinity and less
    than 20 ppm of nitrates. Triticale forage production was better in all plots with
    caw manure application with more than 25 Mg ha-1 that''s is the triticale average
    production in this region and more of 100 % than the control and chemical fertilizer
    plots. According to these resultscaw manure amendments is a good alternative to
    get high triticale forage production and maintain a good soil quality.Read Complete
