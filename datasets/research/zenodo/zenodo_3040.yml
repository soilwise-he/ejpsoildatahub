  title: 'Sensitivity of Earthquake Damage Estimation to the Input Data (Soil Characterization
    Maps and Building Exposure): Case Study in the Luchon Valley, France'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This article studies the effects of the soil data and exposure
    data of residential building inventories, as well as their spatial resolution,
    on seismic damage and loss estimates for a given earthquake scenario. Our aim
    is to investigate how beneficial it would be to acquire higher resolution inventories
    at the cost of additional effort and resources. Seismic damage computations are
    used to evaluate the relative influence of varying spatial resolution on a given
    damage model, where other parameters were held constant. We use soil characterization
    maps and building exposure inventories, provided at different scales from different
    sources: the European database, a national dataset at the municipality scale,
    and local field investigations. Soil characteristics are used to evaluate site
    effects and to assign amplification factors to the strong motion applied to the
    exposed areas. Exposure datasets are used to assign vulnerability indices to sets
    of buildings, from which a damage distribution is produced (based on the applied
    seismic intensity). The different spatial resolutions are benchmarked in a case-study
    area which is subject to moderate-to-average seismicity levels (Luchon valley
    in the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, France). It was found that the proportion of heavily
    damaged buildings is underestimated when using the European soil map and the European
    building database, while the more refined databases (national/regional vs. local
    maps) result in similar estimates for moderate earthquake scenarios. Finally,
    we highlight the importance of pooling open access data from different sources,
    but caution the challenges of combining different datasets, especially depending
    on the type of application that is pursued (e.g., for risk mitigation or rapid
    response tools).&lt;/p&gt;'
