  title: Creation of an innovative robot with a gripper for moving plant microshoots
    from the in vitro transport tank to the working tank with soil ground at the stage
    of their adaptation in soil ground during microclonal reproduction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The industrial development of cities is the main cause of the
    destruction and degradation of natural resources around the world. Urbanization
    negatively affects the species composition of plants, the atmosphere and soil
    cover of areas of populated areas of large cities of the World. Tree plantations
    are the main mechanism for stabilizing the ecological situation in large cities
    and arid territories of the countries of the World.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;In this regard, in order to obtain a large number of genetically identical
    plants using their micropropagation, it is necessary to automate the main stages
    of this technological process.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The result of the study is the creation of an adaptive phalanx gripper
    of a robotic complex for automating the technological process of handling operations.
    That will have a positive effect on solving the urgent problem of planting greenery
    in large cities and areas of arid territories not only in the Republic of Kazakhstan,
    but also in other countries of the World and represents a fundamentally new approach
    to solving the environmental problems of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The article substantiates various options for structural-kinematic schemes
    of the robot gripper, taking into account the stochastic conditions of its interaction
    with the overloaded object. Mathematical methods have been created for the selection
    and justification of the geometric, structural-kinematic and dynamic parameters
    of grippers for overloading plant microshoots and their computer 3D models. Software
    has been developed for modeling the functioning of a remotely controlled physical
    prototype of a mobile robot with an adaptive gripper for reloading microshoots
    from a transport tank to a cargo tank.&lt;/p&gt;'
