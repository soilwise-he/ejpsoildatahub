  title: Vertical Stratification of Soil Phosphorus as a Concern for Dissolved Phosphorus
    Runoff in the Lake Erie Basin
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;During the re-eutrophication of Lake Erie, dissolved reactive phosphorus
    (DRP) loading and concentrations to the lake have nearly doubled, while particulate
    phosphorus (PP) has remained relatively constant. One potential cause of increased
    DRP concentrations is P stratification, or the buildup of soil-test P (STP) in
    the upper soil layer (&lt;5 cm). Stratification often accompanies no-till and
    mulch-till practices that reduce erosion and PP loading, practices that have been
    widely implemented throughout the Lake Erie Basin. To evaluate the extent of P
    stratification in the Sandusky Watershed, certified crop advisors were enlisted
    to collect stratified soil samples (0&ndash;5 or 0&ndash;2.5 cm) alongside their
    normal agronomic samples (0&ndash;20 cm) (n = 1758 fields). The mean STP level
    in the upper 2.5 cm was 55% higher than the mean of agronomic samples used for
    fertilizer recommendations. The amounts of stratification were highly variable
    and did not correlate with agronomic STPs (Spearman&rsquo;s r = 0.039, p = 0.178).
    Agronomic STP in 70% of the fields was within the buildup or maintenance ranges
    for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (0&ndash;46 mg kg&minus;1
    Mehlich 3 P). The cumulative risks for DRP runoff from the large number of fields
    in the buildup and maintenance ranges exceeded the risks from fields above those
    ranges. Reducing stratification by a one-time soil inversion has the potential
    for larger and quicker reductions in DRP runoff risk than practices related to
    drawing down agronomic STP levels. Periodic soil inversion and mixing, targeted
    by stratified STP data, should be considered a viable practice to reduce DRP loading
    to Lake Erie.&lt;/p&gt;'
