  title: Impact Of Wild Fire On Soil Physicochemical Parameters In A Dry Deciduous
    Forest Of Melghat.
  abstract: 'Effects of a wildfire on soil chemical and physical properties in a Melghat
    forest( north ? western compact block is extending over 3075 Sq km. in the Amravati
    district of Maharashtra) were investigated. Response of the soil during the first
    two years following a wildfire was examined, where data from soil in a burned
    forest were compared to that in an adjacent, unburned soil. The effects that wildfire
    have on soil properties in this highly fragmented ecosystem are not well understood,
    but results from this study suggest similar responses to those found in other
    Mediterranean forest systems. Both physical and chemical properties were examined,
    and data presented here suggest that soil properties vary in their initial response
    to fire in this ecosystem.Na and K does not alter in burn and unburned soil, total
    nitrogen also remain same. While total organic carbon increases, electric conductivity
    also increases. TOC: TN ratio also increases. The available phosphorus increases
    sharply which may result in the PH 6.5. The results of this study have implications
    for the productivity and sustainable management of the native forest remnants
    that remain in this region.'
