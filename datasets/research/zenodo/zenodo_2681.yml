  title: Soil stabilisation for DNA metabarcoding of plants and fungi. Implications
    for sampling at remote locations or via third-parties
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Storage of soil samples prior to metagenomic analysis presents\
    \ a problem. If field sites are remote or if samples are collected by third parties,\
    \ transport to analytical laboratories may take several days or even weeks. The\
    \ bulk of such samples and requirement for later homogenisation precludes the\
    \ convenient use of a stabilisation buffer, so samples are usually cooled or frozen\
    \ during transit. There has been limited testing of the most appropriate storage\
    \ methods for later study of soil organisms by eDNA approaches. Here we tested\
    \ a range of storage methods on two contrasting soils, comparing these methods\
    \ to the control of freezing at -80 \xB0C, followed by freeze-drying. To our knowledge,\
    \ this is the first study to examine the effect of storage conditions on eukaryote\
    \ DNA in soil, including both viable organisms (fungi) and DNA contained within\
    \ dying/dead tissues (plants). For fungi, the best storage regimes (closest to\
    \ the control) were storage at 4 \xB0C (for up to 14 d) or active air-drying at\
    \ room temperature. The worst treatments involved initial freezing, followed by\
    \ thawing which led to significant later spoilage. The key spoilage organisms\
    \ were identified as Metarhizium carneum and Mortierella spp., with a general\
    \ increase in saprotrophic fungi and reduced abundances of mycorrhizal/biotrophic\
    \ fungi. Plant data showed a similar pattern, but with greater variability in\
    \ community structure, especially in the freeze-thaw treatments, probably due\
    \ to stochastic variation in substrates for fungal decomposition, algal proliferation\
    \ and some seed germination. In the absence of freeze drying facilities, samples\
    \ should be shipped refrigerated, but not frozen if there is any risk of thawing.&lt;/p&gt;"
