  title: Assessment Of Geotechnical Properties Of Migmatite-Derived Residual Soil
    From Ilorin, Southwestern Nigeria, As Barrier In Sanitary Landfills
  abstract: This study investigates the geotechnical properties of a migmatite - derived
    soil from southwestern Nigeria for its potential use as barrier in sanitary landfill.
    The required parameters for soils to be considered as barrier such as grain size
    distribution, Atterberg consistency limits, maximum dry density (MDD) and the
    coefficient of permeability were determined. Results obtained show that the hydraulic
    conductivity is lower than the suggested limit (1 x 10<sup>-7</sup>cm/s) of the
    various waste regulatory agencies. In addition, it has adequate basic geotechnical
    properties, strength and the shrinkage potential upon drying. These properties
    suggest the potential suitability of the soil as a barrier in containment facility
    for disposal of waste material.
