  title: Determination of the single- and multi- phase transport properties of a layered
    soil by combining laboratory experiments with numerical calculations
  abstract: "A military airport situated in Northern Poland has highly been contaminated\
    \ by jet-\nfuel since 2nd world war. Geological characterization revealed that\
    \ the unsaturated \nzone is a highly heterogeneous soil consisting of three main\
    \ layers dominated by \nmassive clay with desiccation fractures, homogeneous sand,\
    \ and fractured sandy \ntill. In order to proceed in the implementation of an\
    \ in situ stimulation-\nremediation program, information concerning the transport\
    \ properties of the various \nlayers and their interfacial zones is required.\
    \ \nDepending on the texture of the (non-fractured) soil matrix, its single- and\
    \ multi-\nphase transport properties are either estimated with history matching\
    \ of \ndisplacement experiments or calculated from microscopic properties of the\
    \ pore \nstructure. For the permeable sandy layers, immiscible and miscible displacement\
    \ \nexperiments are performed on disturbed and undisturbed soil columns, and the\
    \ \nelectrical resistance along the columns is monitored. The electrical measurements\
    \ \nare employed to calculate the transient response of the water saturation profile\
    \ \nalong the column, as well as the solute concentration breakthrough curve at\
    \ various \naxial positions of the column. The experimental datasets are introduced\
    \ into \nnumerical codes of inverse modeling of the two-phase flow and advection-dispersion\
    \ \nequations to estimate the relative permeability curves, the capillary pressure\
    \ \ncurve, and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient. For the low permeability\
    \ \nmassive clay and sandy till layers, the pore- and throat-size distributions\
    \ along \nwith the network accessibility functions of the matrix are estimated\
    \ by processing \nthe autocorrelation function of 2-D BSEM images of polished\
    \ cross-sections of \nporecasts, and inversing experimental data of Hg intrusion\
    \ / retraction curves. \nThen, critical path analysis is used to calculate the\
    \ absolute permeability, and \nformation factor, whereas a quasi-static pore network\
    \ approach is employed to \ncalculate the relative permeability and capillary\
    \ pressure curves."
