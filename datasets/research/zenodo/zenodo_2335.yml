  title: Removal of hydrocarbons from crude oil contaminated agricultural soil by
    phytoremediation using Mariscus alternifolius and Fimbristylis ferruginea
  abstract: "Crude oil extraction is one major route through which hydrocarbons are\
    \ released into the environment and hydrocarbon contamination is highly hazardous\
    \ to the ecosystem. This study investigated the removal of hydrocarbons from crude\
    \ oil contaminated agricultural soils using <em>Mariscus alternifolius</em> Vahl.\
    \ and <em>Fimbristylis ferruginea</em> plant species. Before planting, the polluted\
    \ soil (negative control) had a total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration of 17962.11\xB1\
    1000.00 mg/kg and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentration of 440.97\xB1\
    1.00 mg/kg. Likewise, the soil oil and organic carbon contents were 3.25\xB10.10\
    \ ppm and 3.06\xB10.02% respectively. Results, 90 days after planting, indicated\
    \ a significant decrease in the total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of\
    \ <em>M. alternifolius </em>(100.82\xB146.31 mg/kg)<em> </em>and<em> F. ferruginea\
    \ </em>(110.41\xB139.68 mg/kg) treated soils. Likewise, there was a significant\
    \ decrease in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentration of <em>M. alternifolius</em>\
    \ treated soil (95.69\xB165.44 mg/kg). The oil content of the treated soils significantly\
    \ decreased to 1.03\xB10.28 ppm and 0.84\xB10.33 ppm in <em>M. alternifolius </em>and\
    \ <em>F. ferruginea</em> treated soils respectively, while the organic content\
    \ of the treated soils significantly decreased to 2.16\xB10.09% and 2.20\xB10.20%\
    \ in <em>M. alternifolius </em>and <em>F. ferruginea</em> treated soils respectively.\
    \ Phytoremediation using <em>M. alternifolius </em>and <em>F. ferruginea</em>\
    \ has proven to be potent in the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil\
    \ through enhancement and recovery of the polluted soil. These plant species which\
    \ improved the cultivation and germination competence of the treated soils thus\
    \ making the soil probable for agricultural and other related purposes are therefore\
    \ recommended for used in the phytoremediation of crude oil contaminated soils."
