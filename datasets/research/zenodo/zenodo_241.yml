  title: 'Association between CBR and Soil Index Properties: Empirical Analysis from
    Chitwan and Makwanpur District Soil Samples'
  abstract: "The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value is a crucial soil parameter\
    \ in road construction and design. Obtaining representative CBR values is challenging,\
    \ requiring time-consuming and expensive testing procedures. To address this issue,\
    \ regression equations were developed to establish correlations between CBR and\
    \ soil index properties. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the soaked\
    \ CBR, Liquid Limit (LL), Plastic Limit (PL), Plasticity Index (PI), Maximum Dry\
    \ Density (MDD), and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) of soil samples. Regression\
    \ models were then created between CBR and different sets of soil index properties\
    \ using Microsoft Excel 2007. Strong correlations were observed between soaked\
    \ CBR, PL, PI, OMC, and MDD (R2 = 0.744); CBR, LL, PL, OMC, and MDD (R2 = 0.702);\
    \ CBR, PI, OMC, and MDD (R2 = 0.643); CBR, LL, OMC, and MDD (R2 = 0.621); and\
    \ CBR, OMC, and MDD (R2 = 0.602). Among all equations, the relation CBR = 0.72\
    \ PL \u2013 1.22 PI + 2.34 OMC + 106.97 MDD \u2013 222.46 exhibited the strongest\
    \ correlation with a P-value of 0.005 and R2 of 0.744.<br>"
