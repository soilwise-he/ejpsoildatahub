  title: Use of Sodium Silicate in Combination with Cement for Improving Peat Soil
    in Mekong River Delta  Vietnam
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Peat soil is formed from river-bog sediments (abQ232) are largely\
    \ distributed in Mekong river Delta provinces-Vietnam such as Kien Giang, Hau\
    \ Giang, B\u1EA1c Li&ecirc;u and Ca Mau. The resuls of research to improve them\
    \ with many kinds of cements showed that the unconfined compressive strength of\
    \ soil samples reinforced by cements had increased within 28 days, from 28 to\
    \ 56 days this strength was reduced. Research for improving the soil above by\
    \ cement and sodium silicate to increase the strength and stability with curing\
    \ time had been conducted. The results showed that the concent of 0.5% of sodium\
    \ silicate in comparison with cement mass was added to soil samples, their strength\
    \ increased significantly when compared to soil samples without sodium silicate\
    \ and greater than that of the soil samples reinforced by contents of 1%, 1.5%\
    \ and 2% of sodium silicate in comparison with cement mass and also the concent\
    \ of 0.5% of sodium silicate in comparison with cement mass added to soil sample\
    \ has solved the problem of reducing soil sample strength with curing time.&lt;/p&gt;"
