  title: Effects of micronutrients on growth and productivity of maize in acidic soil
  abstract: Micronutrients are trace elements which are needed by the maize crop in
    small amounts and play an active role in the plant metabolic functions in shortage
    of which show deficiency symptoms and crop yields are reduced, they are therefore
    to be added into the soil before crop planting or applied directly to the crop
    to increase maize productivity. In order to evaluate the effects of micronutrients
    (B, Zn, o, S and Mn) on the grain production of maize (var. Rampur Composite),
    series of field experiments were conducted during the winter season of three consecutive
    years (2007 to 2009) in the acidic soil condition (5.1 pH) at National maize Research
    Programme (NMRP), Rampur. Plant growth and yield parameters were studied. Results
    of the experiments revealed that the treatments had significant effect on studied
    parameters. Three years yield data following combined analysis indicated a sharp
    response of treatments on grain production and was observed to be highly significant,
    however, the response on the maize grain production among the micronutrient treated
    plots was observed small (5.43-5.99 t/ha of grains) except with the crop that
    lacked sulphur nutrient (4.71 t/ha). The highest grain yield (5.99 t/ha) was recorded
    with the crop which was supplied with all micronutrients (B, Zn, S, Mn and Mo
    applied in combination with NPK fertilizers at 120:60 40 kg /ha which produced
    almost 171 % higher grain yield than those with control plot (2.21 t/ha) and 1.48
    t/ha of additional grains over NPK treated crop. It is suggested to apply micronutrients
    along with recommended dose of fertilizers in the acidic soils of Chitwan.
