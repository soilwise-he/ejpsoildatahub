  title: Regional topsoil organic carbon content in the agricultural soils of Slovakia
    and its drivers, as revealed by the most recent national soil monitoring data
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a primary constituent of soil organic
    matter and plays an important role in the regulation of many soil processes, including
    greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, SOC also became an indicator for monitoring
    climate change mitigation policies in the agricultural sector. The availability
    of up-to-date SOC inventories is thus crucial in terms of supporting SOC&ndash;related
    actions at country or sub-country scales. Currently, the National Monitoring System
    of the Agricultural Soils of Slovakia (CMS-P), whose network of 318 monitoring
    sites was last surveyed in 2018, is the only available source of up-to-date topsoil
    SOC data for agricultural land in Slovakia. Although very useful at the national
    scale, the number of CMS-P observations it contains is too limited for much needed
    sub-national SOC inventories. We hypothesized that with the aid of well-chosen
    macro-scale drivers of topsoil SOC accumulation in agricultural land in Slovakia,
    and by mapping those drivers geographically, we could upscale the CMS-P observations
    and produce a regional estimate of topsoil SOC. Altitude, land cover, topsoil
    texture, and soil type were assumed to be the key factors controlling topsoil
    SOC accumulation in Slovakia, and based on these, the country was classified into
    14 macro-scale geographical regions. Typical ranges and mid-class values of 0&ndash;30cm
    topsoil SOC concentrations (%) and stocks (t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    were calculated for each macro-scale region from CMS-P data. The average topsoil
    SOC content in agricultural land was estimated to be 2.13% (72.9 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
    The highest topsoil SOC stock (&gt; 90 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was
    estimated for the lowlands of Slovakia, and the lowest (&lt; 50 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    for the shallow and stony soils of mountain regions. When aggregated to 78 administrative
    regions at LAU1 level, the area-weighted averages ranged between 39.20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;and
    80.0 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with the highest values (&gt; 65 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    being in LAU1 regions in the south-west, south-east, and north of Slovakia where
    arable land is most prevalent. Total SOC storage in 0&ndash;30cm topsoil of agricultural
    land in Slovakia was estimated at 118.39 Mt, with two-thirds of this amount stored
    in arable soils in 33 south-west, south-east, and south LAU1 administrative regions.
    As there is no alternative and up-to-date dataset on topsoil SOC content in Slovakia,
    the upscaling algorithm presented in this study is an important step toward utilizing
    CMS-P data for sub-national SOC inventories. It may also offer a new way of providing
    inputs to help predict future or alternative regional topsoil SOC accumulation
    trajectories in Slovakian agricultural land using process-based or statistical
    models.&lt;/p&gt;'
