  title: Clean Technology Through Bio Char to Enhance Soil and Water Quality
  abstract: "The ancient indigenous knowledge preserved in Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs),\
    \ a type of extremely fertile soil that contains large amounts of charcoal and\
    \ archaeological arti facts and is typically high in calcium and phosphorus, is\
    \ the source of inspiration for the potential use of bio char in modern agriculture.\
    \ The humid tropics face significant challenges when it comes to sustainable soil\
    \ fertility management. As a result, ADEs have raised public awareness by serving\
    \ as an example of how soil fertility improvements and long-term carbon sequestration\
    \ can coexist. This has increased interest in bio char, a traditional method converted\
    \ into carbon. The surge in food demand and environmental concerns provide numerous\
    \ obstacles for modern agriculture. The potential applications of bio char in\
    \ carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emission reduction, renewable energy, waste\
    \ mitigation, and soil amendment are becoming more and more acknowledged by scientists\
    \ and policy makers. The use of bio char in soil has the potential to significantly\
    \ impact the dynamics of nutrients, soil pollutants, and microbial functions.\
    \ Consequently, applying bio char to soil strategically may have positive effects\
    \ on agriculture, the environment, and the economy. Additionally, recent research\
    \ has demonstrated that bio char plays an important role as a soil conditioner\
    \ and fertilizer to increase crop output as well as improve soil quality and health.\
    \ Applying bio char as a soil supplement appears to improve soil nutrient density,\
    \ water-holding capacity, fertilizer requirements, improve soil microbiology,\
    \ and boost crop yields. Furthermore, using bio char has a number of positive\
    \ effects on the environment, the economy, and possible integration with carbon\
    \ credit schemes. The solution to these basic needs could be found in bio char,\
    \ also referred to as bio carbon.\_"
