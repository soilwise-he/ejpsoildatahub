  title: Effects of regenerative agriculture practices on productivity, GHG emissions,
    and soil C sequestration in tropical rice-based cropping systems
  abstract: A long term experiment (LTE) comparing two rice cropping systems, rice-rice
    (R-R) and maize-rice (M-R), was used to assess the productivity, global warming
    potential (GWP), and soil organic carbon (SOC) of these systems under tropical
    conditions. Regenerative agriculture practices, namely, crop rotation (R-R, M-R),
    non-tillage (tilled, non-tilled), and returning of residues (with residue, without
    residue) were practiced for nine years with two crops per year. Soil submergence
    with rice and drier conditions with maize creates different biogeochemical conditions
    which makes them unique. The LTE monitored the productivity and SOC of R-R and
    M-R cropping systems for eighteen cropping seasons, and GHG emissions were measured
    on the ninth year when the system was relatively more stable. System productivity
    was not affected by returning residues and non-tillage, but it was significantly
    higher in M-R than R-R system in no residue plots regardless of tillage. The GWP,
    however, was not affected by non-tillage or cropping system when residue was not
    returned, but M-R was significantly higher than R-R system in plus residue plots
    regardless of tillage. The SOC generally decreased in all treatments over nine
    years of the same treatment, but the highest SOC in the first 15 cm topsoil was
    found in non-tilled R-R with residue returned (25,201 kg C ha-1) and lowest in
    non-tilled M-R without residue (17,612kg C ha-1). In this study, the R-M had higher
    productivity, but R-R cropping system was more sustainable, in terms of SOC and
    GWP. It shows that rotating flooded rice with non-flooded maize resulted in lower
    SOC, and using maize residue in a flooded rice crop resulted in higher GWP. Non-tillage
    has no significant effect on productivity and SOC when applied to only one of
    the two crops in a year. Residue incorporation contributed in SOC maintenance
    but increased GWP in all treatments.
