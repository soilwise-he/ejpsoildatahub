    leaching of chromium

    <em>Manuscript received online 27 January 2019, accepted 14 March 2019</em> Cr<sup>VI</sup>
    is considered as one of the priority pollutant emanated mainly from the wastewater
    discharge of the tannery industries. In the present research work, batch and column
    adsorption studies were performed to evaluate the Cr<sup>VI</sup> adsorptive potential
    of the clayey soil. The batch adsorption test results indicate the optimum Cr<sup>VI</sup>
    removal efficiency at a soil dose of 200 g/L with an initial solute concentration
    of 5 mg/L at an equilibrium reaction time of 12 h and optimum pH level of 7.0.
    The maximum chromium removal efficiency was achieved at 76%. The hydrodynamic
    parameters estimated through tracer studies and CXTFIT modeling were used as input
    parameters in numerical modeling of Cr<sup>VI</sup> migration through clay soil
    using HYDRUS-1D solute transport software to assess the efficacy of the soil as
    primary liner material in chromium laden waste containment structures.
