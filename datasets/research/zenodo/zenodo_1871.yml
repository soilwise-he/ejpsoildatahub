  title: Investigating the Effect of Nanoclay Additives on the Geotechnical Properties
    of Clay and Silt Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of nanotechnology multi-disciplinary
    cross applications as well as the limitations of traditional materials, nanomaterials
    have been introduced to improve the soil. This paper investigates the potential
    advantages of nanotechnology for innovative solutions in the area of soil improvement.
    Studies on applied nanomaterials in geotechnical engineering show the way these
    nanoparticles are applied to improve soil engineering parameters. In the present
    study, we aimed to investigate the effect of adding Nano clay on the geotechnical
    properties of clay and silt soil and improve their engineering properties. For
    this purpose, a series of tests were conducted including granulation, uniaxial,
    direct shear, Atterberg limits, compaction and triaxial tests on clay and silty
    soils. The results show that the liquid and plastic limits of soil will increase
    with increasing nanoparticles in soil composition. Also, according to the results
    of compaction test, by increasing in Nano clay the unit weight of clay soil will
    increase and optimum moisture content will decrease. According to the results
    from direct shear tests, by increasing in nanoparticles, the adhesion of clay
    and silt soils also increase. However, the internal friction angle of both clay
    and silt soil is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;'
