  title: Tolerance Of Heavy Metals By Gram Positive Soil Bacteria
  abstract: 'With the intention of screening for heavy metal

    tolerance, a number of bacteria were isolated and characterized from

    a pristine soil. Two Gram positive isolates were identified as

    Paenibacillus sp. and Bacillus thuringeinsis. Tolerance of Cd2+, Cu2+

    and Zn2+ by these bacteria was studied and found that both bacteria

    were highly sensitive to Cu2+ compared to other two metals. Both

    bacteria showed the same pattern of metal tolerance in the order Zn+

    &gt; Cd2+ &gt; Cu2+. When the metal tolerance in both bacteria was

    compared, Paenibacillus sp. showed the highest sensitivity to Cu2+

    where as B. thuringiensis showed highest sensitivity to Cd2+ and Zn2+

    .These findings revealed the potential of Paenibacillus sp. in

    developing a biosensor to detect Cu2+ in environmental samples.'
