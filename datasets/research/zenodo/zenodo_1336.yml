  title: Prediction of Pile Bearing Resistance in Multi-Layered Soil using Optimality
    Criterion
  abstract: "<em>This paper discusses the problem of designing a pile foundation in\
    \ a multi-layered soil that optimizes the buckling load, taking into consideration\
    \ the stiffness and frictional resistances of the soil strata. The optimality\
    \ criteria method was applied in the context of Rayleigh\u2019s quotient, and\
    \ solved for by variational principles with associated boundary conditions. The\
    \ results revealed the minimum buckling load of the tapered pile on the multi-layered\
    \ soil, the resultant effect on the elastic boundary condition. A numerical illustration\
    \ is presented to emphasize the impact of the pile's tapering and shaft friction,\
    \ soil non-uniformity, pile-soil stiffness, and the boundary condition at both\
    \ ends of the pile. It is expected that the study will furnish geotechnical and\
    \ structural engineers with a tool to easily predict strength improvements in\
    \ pile foundations from any known layered soil medium</em><em>.</em>"
