  title: "Screening and Comparative Characterization of Microorganisms from Iranian\
    \ Soil Samples Showing \xCF\u2030-Transaminase Activity toward a Plethora of Substrates"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this study, soil microorganisms from Iran were screened for
    &omega;-transaminase (&omega;-TA) activity based on growth on minimal media containing
    (rac)-&alpha;-methylbenzylamine (rac-&alpha;-MBA) as a sole nitrogen source. Then,
    for the selection of strains with high enzyme activity, a colorimetric o-xylylendiamine
    assay was conducted. The most promising strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing.
    Five microorganisms showing high &omega;-TA activity were subjected to determine
    optimal conditions for &omega;-TA activity, including pH, temperature, co-solvent,
    and the specificity of the &omega;-TA toward di&alpha;erent amine donors and acceptors.
    Among the five screened microorganisms, Bacillus halotolerans turned out to be
    the most promising strain: Its cell-free extract showed a highly versatile amino
    donor spectrum toward aliphatic, aromatic chiral amines and a broad range of pH
    activity. Transaminase activity also exhibited excellent solvent tolerance, with
    maximum turnover in the presence of 30% (v/v) DMSO.&lt;/p&gt;'
