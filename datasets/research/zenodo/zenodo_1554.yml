    microbiota
  abstract: "Optical density of root exudate of yellow lupin of Promin\u2019, Motuv\
    \ 369, Borsel'fa, Obriy varieties and line 448/8 and lupin white of Olezhka, Suniy\
    \ parys, Pizhovuy varieties and alcaloides form in laboratory conditions were\
    \ studied. Variety peculiarities of secretory activity of root plants systems\

    \ conditions Western Podillya have been shown. Essential changes in quantity mushrooms,\
    \ bacteria and streptomices in rhizosphere and space between rows of diverse lupin\
