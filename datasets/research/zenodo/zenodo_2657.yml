  title: Productivity and grain quality of winter triticale varieties (Triticosecale
    Wittmack el. Camus) under different soil and climatic growing conditions
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. To evaluate the productivity\
    \ and grain quality of winter triticale varieties grown under different soil and\
    \ climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;.\
    \ The research process involved laboratory, computational and statistical methods,\
    \ and analysis and synthesis to draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;.\
    \ HTC (IV&ndash;X) was found to vary significantly monthly, annually and in general\
    \ between the research sites. It was found that the yield of winter triticale\
    \ varieties in the Forest-Steppe and Polissia zones was 5.3 t/ha. The maximum\
    \ yield in the Forest-Steppe zone was achieved by the variety &lsquo;MIP Feniks&rsquo;\
    \ (5.9 t/ha), in the Polissia zone by the variety &lsquo;Pamiati Patseky&rsquo;\
    \ (5.8 t/ha). It was found that the protein content of winter triticale varieties\
    \ for the 2019&ndash;2020 research years in the Forest-Steppe zone was on average\
    \ 12.6% and ranged from 12.2% (&lsquo;Liubomyr&rsquo;) to 13.3% (&lsquo;MIP Yatahan&rsquo;),\
    \ which according to the classifier corresponded to grain of medium quality and\
    \ can be used in the confectionery industry. The coefficient of variation (V,%)\
    \ for this characteristic was 3.5%. In the Polissia zone, the protein content\
    \ of the varieties averaged 13.6% over the years of research and ranged from 12.9%\
    \ &ndash; medium content (&lsquo;MIP Feniks&rsquo;) to 14.3% &ndash; high content\
    \ (&lsquo;MIP Yatahan&rsquo;). The intrazone variation was low and amounted to\
    \ 4.0%. Correlation and regression analysis showed that an increase in the active\
    \ temperature during the vegetation period up to 3203 \u043E\u0421 allows an increase\
    \ in the productivity indicators and in the weight of 1000 grains from 5.6 to\
    \ 6.1 t/ha and from 46.8 to 53.5 g, respectively; an increase in precipitation\
    \ during the vegetation period up to 515.1 mm leads to a decrease in the weight\
    \ of 1000 grains from 45.2 to 38.1 g; with an increase in the amount of active\
    \ temperatures and precipitation during the vegetation period from 3167.65 to\
    \ 3202.9 \u043E\u0421 and from 413.85 to 515.1 mm, respectively, it is possible\
    \ to increase the protein content in grain from 12.4 to 13.8%; with an increase\
    \ in the yield and weight of 1000 grains from 5.8 to 6.1 t/ha and from 51.8 to\
    \ 53.8 g, the protein content of the grain can be reduced from 13.1 to 12.0%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\
    \n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;. Different responses of varieties\
    \ to zonal growing conditions were observed. A positive influence of the rainfall\
    \ factor during the growing season on the yield of winter triticale in Forest-Steppe\
    \ and Polissia (r = 0.66 and 0.34 units) and on the increase of the protein content\
    \ of grain grown in the Polissia zone (r = 0.56) was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;"
