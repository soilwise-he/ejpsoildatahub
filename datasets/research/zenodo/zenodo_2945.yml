  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the correlation between bacterial abundance\
    \ and soil physicochemical properties along the heavy metal contamination gradient\
    \ in the area of non-ferrous metal processing plant was assessed. Our results\
    \ showed that bacterial abundance (number of heterotrophic bacteria and number\
    \ of 16S rRNA gene copies) decreased with 45\u201356% (CFU) and 54\u201387% (16S\
    \ rRNA gene) along the Zn, Pb and Cd contamination gradient. The total bacterial\
    \ abundance (16S rRNA gene) increased exponentially in contrast to the abundance\
    \ of heterotrophic bacteria. The reduction of bacterial abundance in heavily contaminated\
    \ soil indicated that the soil properties (soil pH, total organic carbon, inorganic\
    \ ions, soil texture) could modify the effects of heavy metals and the response\
    \ of microorganisms to that stress in long-term contaminated soils.&lt;/p&gt;"
