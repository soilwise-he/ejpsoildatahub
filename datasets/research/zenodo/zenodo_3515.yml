  title: Stabilization of Black Cotton Soil by Using Construction and Demolition Waste
  abstract: "Black cotton (BC) soil that change significantly in volume with change\
    \ in water content is the major cause of distortions to structures in India since,\
    \ it covers around 20% of land area. Over the years successful methods have been\
    \ used to stabilize them. However, it is found very important for engineers to\
    \ judge the effectiveness and appropriateness of all stabilizers. Black cotton\
    \ soil constitutes of a too easy phyllosillicate collection of minerals that procedure\
    \ when they involve from water solution as microscopic minerals known as Montmorillonite.\
    \ Clay mineral that have susceptibility to change volume with application of moisture\
    \ into it which in turn create various problems during construction on site due\
    \ to swelling and shrinkage behavior. The expansive soils encounters swelling\
    \ and shrinkage during different wet and dry seasons causing considerable damage\
    \ to structures. The problems caused by expansive soil to the stability of civil\
    \ engineering structures have received universal attention in view of serious\
    \ economic loss at national level of many nations. Now a day\u2019s construction\
    \ industry is increasing rapidly in India due to improving economic growth; and\
    \ large amount of waste being generated. In this research we have studied various\
    \ soil parameters with respect to conventional soil ( sample procured from field)\
    \ and stabilized soil ( by adding increasing percentages of construction and demolition\
    \ waste) and the C&amp;D waste percentages are added as 3%, 6% and 9% the CBR\
    \ values are increased considerably."
