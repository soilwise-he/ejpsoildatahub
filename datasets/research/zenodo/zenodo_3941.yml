  title: A Geographical Study Of Soil Characteristic In Sugarcane Cultivation Of Rahuri
    Tahsil Of Ahmedngar District (Ms)
  abstract: "<em>Sugarcane requires more water compare to other crops within growth\
    \ periods. Its requires more water in summer season due to increases in temperature.\
    \ Its growth is found successfully where the annual rainfall received 1400 to\
    \ 2500 mm. pH in water is high (more than 8.1) is found in 21.72 percent villages.\
    \ These villages come under canal and other source of irrigation. Less than 7.5\
    \ pH is found in 44 percent villages in the study area. EC in soil is suggested\
    \ that it\u2019s sufficient range in 25.54 percent villages. Calcium is existing\
    \ less than 1.5 per kg/hr. is not sufficient for sugarcane. It is found high proportion\
    \ (more than 3.1 per kg/hr.) in 37 percent villages in study area. Magnesium covered\
    \ high ratio in 28 villages and chlorides is found on high ratio in 67 percent\
    \ villages, which is affected on sugarcane growth. </em>"
