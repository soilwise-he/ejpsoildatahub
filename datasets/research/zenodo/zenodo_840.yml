  title: Soil Classification and Harvest Proposal Implemented using Machine Learning
    Techniques
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The major source of living for the people of India is agriculture.
    It is considered as important economy for the country. India is one of the country
    that suffer from natural calamities like drought and flood that may destroy the
    crops which may lead to heavy loss for the people doing agriculture. Predicting
    the crop type can help them to cultivate the suitable crop that can be cultivated
    in that particular soil type. Soil is one major factor or agriculture. There are
    several types of soil available in our county. In order to classify the soil type
    we need to understand the characteristics of the soil. Data mining and machine
    learning is one of the emerging technology in the field of agriculture and horticulture.
    In order to classify the soil type and Provide suggestion of fertilizers that
    can improve the growth of the crop cultivated in that particular soil type plays
    major role in agriculture. For that here exploring Several machine learning algorithms
    such as Support vector machine(SVM),k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) and logistic regression
    are used to classify the soil type.&lt;/p&gt;'
