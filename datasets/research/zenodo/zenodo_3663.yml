  title: Development Of Corn (Zea Mays L.) Stalk Geotextile Net For Soil Erosion Mitigation
  abstract: 'This study aimed to introduce new natural fiber to be used in the production
    of geotextile net for mitigation of soil erosion. Fiber extraction from the stalks
    was the main challenge faced during the processing of stalks to ropes. Thus, an
    investigation on the extraction procedures of corn (<em>Zea mays</em> L.) stalk
    under biological and chemical retting was undertaken. Results indicated significant
    differences among percent fiber yield as affected by the retting methods used
    with values of 15.07%, 12.97%, 11.60%, and 9.01%, for dew, water, chemical (1
    day after harvest and15 days after harvest), respectively, with the corresponding
    average extracting duration of 70, 82, 89, and 94 minutes. Physical characterization
    of the developed corn stalk geotextile net resulted to average mass per unit area
    of 806.25 g/m<sup>2</sup> and 241% water absorbing capacity. The effect of corn
    stalk geotextile net in mitigating soil erosion was evaluated in a laboratory
    experiment for 30<sup>o</sup> and 60<sup>o</sup> inclinations with three treatments:
    bare soil (A<sub>1</sub>), corn stalk geotextile net (A<sub>2</sub>) and combined
    cornstalk geotextile net and vegetation cover (A<sub>3</sub>). Results revealed
    that treatment A<sub>2 </sub>and A<sub>3</sub> significantly decreased sediment
    yield and an increase in terms of soil loss reduction efficiency. The cost of
    corn stalk geotextile net is Php 62.41 per square meter.'
