  title: Plant remains of Syringa vulgaris L. as a factor of allelopatnic soil fatigue
  abstract: "Allelopathic properties of vegetating organs and plant remains of <em>Syringa\
    \ vulgaris</em> L. were studied. The allelopathic activity of plant remains was\
    \ 1.5\u20136 times higher and depended on cultivars. The high positive correlation\
    \ between allelopathic activity of plant remains and content of phenolics was\
    \ established. The effect of plant remains on biochemical characteristics and\
    \ phytotoxicity of soil rhizosphere was investigated."
