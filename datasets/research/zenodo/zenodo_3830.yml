  title: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF STABILIZED EXPANSIVE SOIL USING PUMICE MIXED WITH LIME
    FOR SUBGRADE ROAD CONSTRUCTION
  abstract: Unsuitable soil materials along the alignment of road projects have a
    significant influence on planning, design, construction, and maintenance. Expansive
    soils are susceptible to considerable volume changes due to seasonal variations
    and moisture content. Most soils found in Jimma and Ambo Zones composed of plastic
    clay soil, causing severe damage at the intermittent of pavement sections. This
    research study conducted laboratory investigation considering combinations of
    materials blended to stabilize the expansive soil for subgrade construction. An
    experimental type of study performed which started by collecting specimens. Two
    clayey soil specimens considered to test the free swell index obtained from a
    depth of 1.5m to remove the organic impurities. Results indicated the chemical
    analysis of pumice contained 82.68%, while its physical properties of the test
    of fineness specific surface and residue on 45 microns showed 3770 cm2 /gm and
    30%, respectively. As the lime content increased, the CBR strength also increased.
    But, if the percent content of lime decreased with an increasing pumice content,
    the CBR value did not show any significant increase. Both the chemical and physical
    properties satisfied the requirements according to ASTM C-618. Hence, this experiment
    obtained 7% lime + 3% pumice as an optimum mix ratio to stabilize expansive soils.
