  title: Yield components and genetic potential of winter wheat on pseudogley soil
    of western Serbia
  abstract: "In order to determine the effect of genotype and vegetation season on\
    \ the yield<br> and components of the winter wheat yield an experiment was performed\
    \ in the<br> secondary agricultural-chemical school \u201CDr \u0110or\u0111e Radi\u0107\
    \u201D in Kraljevo. Five<br> wheat varieties (Kruna, Renesansa, Pobeda, NS 40S\
    \ and Takov\u010Danka) were<br> examined during two growing seasons in the agro-ecological\
    \ conditions of<br> Western Serbia. Trials were arranged according to a randomized\
    \ scheme in<br> five repetitions. Grain yield (GY), 1000 grain weight (TGW) and\
    \ test weight<br> (TW) in winter wheat grain were analysed. The study was performed\
    \ as an<br> experiment based on extremely acidic pseudogley soil. On average,\
    \ for all<br> wheat varieties, during the two-year trial, the highest yield of\
    \ winter wheat<br> 4.673 t/ha was obtained in the variety Renesansa. The Renesansa\
    \ variety<br> showed the highest yield and 1000 grain weight. The highest 1000\
    \ grain<br> weight of investigation on wheat cultivar Renesansa (43.72 g). The\
    \ highest<br> two-year average value of test weight was found in the varieties\
    \ Kruna and<br> Pobeda (77.52 kg/hl and 77.31 kg/hl). Analysis of variance revealed\
    \ a highly<br> significant effect of the growing season on the yield and test\
    \ weight of wheat.<br> A highly significant effect of genotype on 1000 grain weight\
    \ and test weight<br> was determined<br>"
