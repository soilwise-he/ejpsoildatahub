  title: Effect Of Poultry Manure And Nitrogen, Phosphorus, And Potassium (15:15:15)
    Soil Amendment On Growth And Yield Of Carrot (Daucus Carota)
  abstract: This present experiment was carried out during the 2012 cropping season,
    at the Farming for the Future Experimental Field of the University for Development
    Studies, Nyankpala Campus in the Northern Region of Ghana. The objective of the
    experiment was to determine the carrot growth and yield responses to poultry manure
    and N.P.K (15:15:15). Six treatments (Control (no amendment), 20 t/ha poultry
    manure (PM), 40 t/ha PM, 70 t/ha PM, 35 t/ha PM + 0.11t/ha N.P.K and 0.23 t/ha
    N.P.K) with three replications for each were laid in a Randomized Complete Block
    Design (RCBD). Data were collected on plant height, number of leaves per plant,
    canopy spread, root diameter, root weight, and root length. Microsoft Excel and
    Genstat Statistical Package (9<sup>th</sup> edition) were used for the data analysis.
    The treatment means were compared by using Least Significant Difference at 10%.
    Generally, the results showed that there were no significant differences (P&gt;0.1)
    among the treatments with respect to number of leaves per plant, root diameter,
    root weight, and root length. However, significant differences occurred among
    plant heights and canopy spreads. Plant height treated with 40 t/ha PM at the
    fourth week after planting and canopy spread at eight weeks after planting and
    ten weeks after planting by 70 t/ha PM and 20 t/ha PM respectively showed significant
    difference (P&lt;0.1). The study recommended that any of the amended treatments
    can be applied at their recommended rates to plots for carrot production, since
    there were no significant differences among the treatments.
