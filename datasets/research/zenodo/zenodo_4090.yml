  title: A Study On Physicochemical Analysis Of Road And Railway Track Side Soil Samples
    Of Amritsar (Punjab) And Their Genotoxic Effects
  abstract: Considering the serious health hazards of air pollutants from automobiles,
    the present study was aimed to estimate the genotoxic/tumor inducing potential
    of three soil samples collected from junctions of Bus stand (BS), Crystal (CT)
    and Railway station (RS) of Amritsar, Punjab (India) using <em>Allium cepa</em>
    root chromosomal aberration assay (<em>Al</em>RCAA) and potato disc tumor assay
    (PDTA). The genotoxic potential in <em>Al</em>RCAA was 41.27% and 41.26% for BS;
    37.89% and 43.38% for RS and 33.76% and 37.83% for CT during <em>in situ</em>
    and root dip treatments, respectively. The maximum number of tumors were induced
    in RS sample (64) followed by BS (21) and CT (9) during PDTA. The physicochemical
    parameters of soil sample were also studied and the concentration of lead was
    found to be 95.21 mg/Kg in RS, 35.30 mg/Kg in BS and 24.59 mg/Kg in CT samples.
