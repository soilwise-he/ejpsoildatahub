  title: Mollusks as Indicators of the State of Soil and Water in Uzbekistan
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The work examines the vital activity of mollusks. About 160
    species of terrestrial mollusks have been identified in Uzbekistan. It has been
    established that 12 species of terrestrial mollusks live on the plains in the
    steppe serozem soils at heights. Psychromezobionts live in hydromorphic soil among
    turf and under stones. Typical and dark soils are home to over 20 species of mollusks.
    On brown, brown-mountain-forest, light-brown meadow-steppe soils, 4 species of
    endemic mollusks live. Brackish-water mollusks were also found, which are divided
    into eurygane, living in a wide range of water salinity, and stenohaline, living
    in a narrow range of water salinity. Mollusks-indicators of the type and condition
    of the soil have been determined. In conclusion, the author concludes that it
    is necessary to further study the species composition and indicator role of mollusks
    in Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;'
