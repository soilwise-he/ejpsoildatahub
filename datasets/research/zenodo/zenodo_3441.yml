  title: Performance Of Maize (Zea Mays) Grown On Mildly Acidic Low Fertile Soil As
    Affected By Selected Organic-Based Soil Amendments And Synthetic Fertilizer
  abstract: Under intensive cropping systems in the tropics, application of chemical
    fertilizers becomes an apparently indispensable means of replenishing the rapidly
    depleting soil nutrients. However, the reported side effects of continuous application
    of synthetic fertilizers on soil and man are now a major concern. Hence, determination
    of the potentials of some easily exploitable natural or organic-based fertilizer
    material(s), which can effectively compete with the commonly used synthetic fertilizers
    like NPK 15-15-15, is a worthwhile scientific approach, not towards improved performance
    of versatile arable crop like maize, but also for total eradication or alleviation
    of chemical inputs on tropical soils. A field experiment was conducted at the
    Teaching and Research Farms, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH),
    Ogbomoso, in the year 2017, to comparatively determine the effects of NPK fertilizer
    and some selected organic-based fertilizer / ammendments on growth, yield and
    nutrient uptakes of maize (Zea mays). Six treatments were introduced, T0 (the
    control which received no fertilizer application), T1 (NPK fertilizer application),
    T2 (Tithonia compost application), T3 (Organomineral fertilizer application),
    T4 (Poultry manure application) and T5 (Cow dung application). All fertilizers
    were applied at recommended rates. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete
    Block Design (RCBD), replicated thrice. Data were collected on growth and yield
    parameters, and were subjected to analysis of variance.
