  title: Studies of the possibilities of using organic waste to increase soil productivity
    for grain crops in the conditions of Sheki-Zagatala zone of Azerbaijan
  abstract: The article discusses the problems of the use of waste as organic fertilizers
    help to increase soil fertility, improve the nutritional regime, and also helps
    maintain ecological balance. The introduction into the soil of various types and
    doses of organic and ratios of mineral fertilizers for crops (winter wheat, barley,
    barley, rye, hay, others) both individually and together contributes to the improvement
    of product quality, in particular, the structure of the crop and, accordingly,
    soil fertility, thereby reducing the intensity of the development of the erosion
    process characteristic in the republic. The use of organic and mineral fertilizers
    in various types and doses for crops has a rather positive effect on the formation
    of wheat grains and creates the possibility of obtaining high yields, which is
    proved by the results of the experiment laid down in 7 variants, in a 4-fold repetition,
    on plots with an area of each plot in the amount of 100m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, in
    the course of the research, the effect of organic and mineral fertilizers on the
    quality of winter wheat grain was also studied, where the main quality indicator
    of the protein content in the grain in the application of mineral fertilizers
    in a dose of N<sub>100</sub>P<sub>50</sub>K<sub>120</sub> was 11.40%, in the version
    of 10t / ha of compost Zakatala + N<sub>50</sub>P<sub>25</sub>K<sub>60</sub>-11.97%,
    the difference of which compared with the version without fertilizers was 2.28%
    and 2.85%, respectively, and the increase in grain yield was 10 ts/ha - (42.9%),
    and straw - 16.4 c / ha (or 41.8%).
