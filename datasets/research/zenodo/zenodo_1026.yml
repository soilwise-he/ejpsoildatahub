  abstract: In July 2002, the AIRSAR system flew several data acquisition flights
    during the SMEX'02 field experiment in Iowa. The test site was chosen specifically
    because of the varying vegetation cover to allow more quantitative testing of
    the radar inversion algorithms under these conditions. Field conditions were generally
    favorable for this experiment, and data were acquired during an initial dry period,
    followed by a wet period after significant rain, and again followed by a drier
    period. This paper discusses in detail the characteristics of the AIRSAR data
    acquired, and provides an initial quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the
    radar algorithm under these vegetated conditions.
