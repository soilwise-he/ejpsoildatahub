  title: D 2.2 SERENA Soil threats and soil ecosystem services of interest in SERENA
  abstract: "This report from task 2.2 of the EJP SOIL SERENA project presents definitions,\
    \ information and indicators related to soil threats, soil ecosystem services\
    \ (SES) and their bundles relevant for European member states. A significant part\
    \ of the work consisted in finding common harmonised definitions for the soil\
    \ threats and ES between the 16 participating European member states in SERENA.\
    \ Based on these harmonised definitions, a prioritisation of soil threats and\
    \ SES was done by each member state. This resulted in an overall ranking of the\
    \ soil threats and SES in order from high to lower interest for SERENA. The soil\
    \ threat \u2018Loss of soil organic carbon\u2019 and the SES \u2018Soil organic\
    \ carbon and Greenhouse gas and climate regulation/carbon sequestration\u2019\
    \ were scored with the highest priority. Finally, an additional translation was\
    \ done from technical English to a non-soil-expert language for each soil threat\
    \ and SES. This translation and the prioritisation of the soil threats and SES\
    \ will be evaluated by the SERENA stakeholders in WP1 of the SERENA project. The\
    \ selection of specific indicators and the assessment of thresholds for the soil\
    \ threats and SES of interest in SERENA will be done by WP2 T2.3."
