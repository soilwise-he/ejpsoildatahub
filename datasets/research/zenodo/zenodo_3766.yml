  title: RADON CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS IN SOIL GAS OF SAWA LAKE, SAMAWA CITY -
    SOUTH OF IRAQ.
  abstract: Radon concentration measurements in the soil gas and in the atmospheric
    air was carried out around Sawa lake, Samawa City, Southern part of Iraq. Thirtieth
    chosen locations as sampling points of soil around the lake have been studied.
    The radon in soil gas were measured using a continuous radon monitoring device
    RAD7. Radon concentrations was found in the range of (86.9 Bq.m-3) to (6448 Bq.m-3)
    with an average value of (1963 Bq.m-3). Annual effective dose (AED) due to inhalation
    was estimated from the measured radon concentration near to the soil surface and
    is found to be ranged from (0.000826) to (0.061282 mSv.y-1) with an average value
    of (0.01866 mSv.y-1). The AED due to inhalation were found to be within the safe
    limit recommended by WHO of 0.1mSv.y-1 and or far below from the reference levels
    proposed by ICRP of 1mSv.y-1, which revealed that the radon concentration and
    the associated annual effective dose does not pose any kind of health hazard to
    the population and tourists in the study area.
