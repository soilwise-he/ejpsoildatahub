  title: Biogeographical patterns in soil bacterial communities across the Arctic
    region
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The considerable microbial diversity of soils and key role in
    biogeochemical cycling have led to growing interest in their global distribution
    and the impact that environmental change might have at the regional level. In
    the broadest study of Arctic soil bacterial communities to date, we used high-throughput
    DNA sequencing to investigate the bacterial diversity from 200 independent Arctic
    soil samples from 43 sites. We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental
    factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis,
    illustrating a nonrandom distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the
    key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while
    total organic carbon (TOC), moisture and conductivity were shown to have little
    effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while
    generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of the 48 147 bacterial
    taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously distributed
    and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the high potential
    for endemism in the region. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of
    spatial and edaphic factors on the structure of Arctic soil bacterial communities.&lt;/p&gt;'
