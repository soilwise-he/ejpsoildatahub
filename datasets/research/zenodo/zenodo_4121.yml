  title: Spatial variation of soil salinity of the southern part of the alluvial plain
    of Iraq and its impact on agricultural production
  abstract: 'Abstract: The problem of soil salinity from the grave on the soils and
    agricultural production in the regions of the world in general and Iraq and soil
    southern part of the alluvial plain of the Iraqi problems, as reflected by leaving
    large tracts of agricultural lands and low agricultural production, so research
    aims to know the historical evolution of this problem and determine the quality
    and quantity of salts and to clarify the reasons for the accumulation and effects
    and finally propose appropriate solutions. The first signs of salinity in the
    search area have emerged since the mid-third millennium BC and took worsen to
    the present time, Show of Soils region it Mazijah Grenier with Mgas slow permeability
    medium general rate of salinity 13.5 Mlmoz / cm, and the ESP approximately 18.4%
    and PH 6,7, for all sites to soil the banks of the river basins, and therefore
    considered soils saline alkaline increases towards the south and from the banks
    of rivers lowlands adjacent to the accumulation of salts is due to the interaction
    of a number of factors, including very high evaporation and saline groundwater
    level, the quality of irrigation water, excessive irrigation, exercise Altbooir
    system, the lack of Alambazl, poor natural drainage ........ etc, the risk of
    salinity problem requires radical solutions is to create Mpazl wash, in addition
    to the need to educate farmers about the correct practice in irrigation and drainage
    techniques, in particular agricultural operations in general to keep the soil
    and water resources, which is one of the natural resources the task. As well as
    to increase agricultural production in order to ensure the needs of food that
    is growing as a result of the forced and high standard of living of the population
    growth.'
