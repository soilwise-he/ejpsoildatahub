  title: 'Soil Suitability For Solid Waste Dumping: Implication For Groundwater Protection'
  abstract: "ABSTRACT :\n\nAnthropogenic activities in Urban cities of developing\
    \ countries has resulted soil pollution and groundwater contamination. Therefore\
    \ the objective of this paper is test suitability of soil for solid waste dumping\
    \ based on Physio-chemical parameters and textural analysis of soil around periphery\
    \ of Davanagere Urban city.The city experiences semi-arid climate with a moderate\
    \ rainfall located in Central Karnataka, India. Textural analysis indicated that\
    \ soil is silt loam with moderate high permeability (10-3 to 10-4 cm/sec).The\
    \ collected soil sample terminate slightly less in Liquid Limit and more in Plastic\
    \ Limit (Liquid Limit&gt;50% and Plastic Limit&lt;30%). soil=\"\" suitability=\"\

    \ suitability index was computed based on ratings allotted for each soil parameter\
    \ and site suitable for solid waste dumping is determined. The study indicates\
    \ that the soil has neutral pH and moderately high permeabilityand hence groundwater\
    \ protection works to be taken up for sites selected based on soil suitability\
    \ index. \n\n&lt;30%). soil=\"\" suitability=\"\" index=\"\" was=\"\" computed=\"\
