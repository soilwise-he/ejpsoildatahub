  title: Assessment of Soil Homogeneity using Geoelectrical Diametrix in Layered and
    Weathered Rocks
  abstract: This paper explores the use of diametrically aligned vertical electric
    sounding VES in assessing homogeneity and anisotropy in layered sedimentary soils
    and in weathered rock formation. Both Wenner and schlumberger electrode configurations
    were used in the sedimentary and weathered rock formation respectively, and augmented
    by geotechnical boring to 30m. The Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to the diametrically
    aligned VES data where the presence of significant differences between the data
    sets suggested degrees of uniformity in ground resistivity and by extension compositional
    quality and structure. Similarly, characteristic values of electrical resistivity
    in diametrically opposite directions of the geo-layers were determined and compared.
    By evaluating the differences in apparent resistivity at the same depth, a measure
    of homogeneity was derived. Various degrees of homogeneity were established at
    both the sedimentary and weathered formation.
