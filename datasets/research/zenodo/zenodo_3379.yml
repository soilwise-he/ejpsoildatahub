  title: Heavy Metal Reduction in Plant Using Soil Amendment
  abstract: This study investigated the influence of limestone and sepiolite on heavy
    metals accumulation in the soil and soybean. The soil was synthesized to contaminate
    with zinc 150 mg/kg, copper 100 mg/kg, and cadmium 1 mg/kg. The contaminated soil
    was mixed with limestone and sepiolite at the ratio of 1:0, 0:1, 1:1, and 2:1.
    The amount of soil modifier added to soil was 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8%. The metals
    determination was performed on soil both before and after soybean planting and
    in the root, shoot, and seed of soybean after harvesting. The study was also on
    metal translocate from root to seed and on bioaccumulation factor. Using of limestone
    and sepiolite resulted in a reduction of metals accumulated in soybean. For soil
    containing a high concentration of copper, cadmium, and zinc, a mixture of limestone
    and sepiolite (1:1) was recommended to mix with soil with the amount of 0.2%.
    Zinc could translocate from root to seed more than copper, and cadmium. From studying
    the movement of metals from soil to accumulate in soybean, the result was that
    soybean could absorb the highest amount of cadmium, followed by zinc, and copper,
    respectively.
