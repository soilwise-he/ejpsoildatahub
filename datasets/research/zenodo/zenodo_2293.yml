  title: Factorial Analysis of Soil pH as a Function of Its Moisture Content and Distance
    from Flare Point
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract\u2014</strong> This paper presents a derived model which\
    \ predicts the soil pH based on its soil moisture content and distance from flare\
    \ point. The response coefficient of the soil pH to the distance from flare point\
    \ and soil moisture content was evaluated to ascertain the viability and reliability\
    \ of the highlighted dependence. Results of series of evaluations carried out\
    \ indicate that the correlations between soil pH and distance from flare point\
    \ &amp; soil moisture content as evaluated from the actual and model-predicted\
    \ results were all \u02C3 0.88. Standard errors incurred in obtaining results\
    \ of soil pH based on distance from flare point &amp; moisture content were 0.08\
    \ and 0.07 &amp; 0.076 and 0.06%, as obtained from actual and model-predicted\
    \ results respectively. The validity of the model; \u03BE = - 0.0496 \u03B2<sup>2</sup>\
    \ \u2013 1.5 x10<sup>-7</sup>\u03D1 + 0.7122\u03B2 + 0.0003\u03D1 + 2.5408 was\
    \ rooted on the insignificant maximum deviation of model-predicted values of soil\
    \ pH from the corresponding actual values which was less than 1.1%. This translated\
    \ into over 98.9% operational confidence level for the derived model as well as\
    \ over 0.98 response coefficient of soil pH to the combined operational influence\
    \ of distance from flare point and soil moisture content."
