  title: Growth and yield responses of tomato to irrigation in screenhouse-potted
    soil amended with varying levels of poultry manure
  abstract: "The need for production of high value crops has increased over the years,\
    \ hence the need to more appropriately determine irrigation water levels in water-scarce\
    \ scenarios. The Aim of this research was to 1) determine the effect of deficit\
    \ irrigation on growth and yield of tomato, and 2) determine how poultry manure\
    \ amendments of soil would interact with irrigation to influence the observed\
    \ growth and yield responses. There were two irrigation levels namely 0.75 and\
    \ 1.5 l per plant per week, combined with 0, 34 and 68 g/plant poultry manure,\
    \ in a 2 x 3 factorial design with three replicates. Growth and yield parameters\
    \ were measured till maturity. Data were analysed through RTANOVA in a GLM at\
    \ \u03B1=0.05. Results showed that the combination of 0.75 l irrigation water\
    \ per plant per week with 34 g poultry manure per plant significantly increased\
    \ number of leaves, branches and collar diameter. At low levels of irrigation\
    \ (0.75 l/plant/week) the highest number of flowers (196) is produced under fertilization\
    \ with 68 g poultry manure per plant, with a reproductive success rate of 18.37%.\
    \ When the irrigation rate doubles, the highest number of flowers (126 /plant)\
    \ is produced in plants fertilized with 34 g/plant poultry manure, with a reproductive\
    \ success rate of 42.06%., representing the best combination of treatments for\
    \ maximum fruit yield; doubling manure rates to 68 g/plant results in increased\
    \ flower abortion and reduced reproductive success."
