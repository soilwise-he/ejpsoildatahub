  title: Agroforestry Systems As Conditioners Of Physical And Structural Quality Of
    The Soil
  abstract: "The study of transformations that occur in the soil, resulting from the\
    \ use and management adopted, is very important in the choice of the most suitable\
    \ system to recover the soil functions. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess\
    \ the impact of agroforestry systems (AFS\xB4s) management, in different successional\
    \ stages, on soil physical quality in south of S\xE3o Paulo state (Brazil). The\
    \ work was conducted under an Ultisol (Arenic Dystrudult). It was evaluated the\
    \ fowling physical soil attributes: density, porosity, flocculation index and\
    \ soil aggregate stability. The experiment was conducted in factorial scheme,\
    \ and graded on type of use/management (AFS 12 years; AFS 2.5 years; AFS 1 year\
    \ and native forest) as well as depth (0-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.40 m). The results\
    \ showed that over time, consolidated agroforestry systems provide less impactful\
    \ alternatives and can assist in reversing the degradation processes, increasing\
    \ soil porosity under these systems and reduce soil density, greater stability\
    \ of aggregates and smaller thermal variations of soil. Therefore, consolidated\
    \ agroforestry systems (12 years) promote a resilience of the soil structure and\
    \ should be included in the production system, especially in regions of environmental\
    \ preservation."
