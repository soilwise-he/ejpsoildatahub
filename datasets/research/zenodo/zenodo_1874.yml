  title: Analysis of the Possibilities of Bioremediation of Soil Loaded with Waste
    from the Paper Industry
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The object of research in this scientific
    paper is the treatment of waste generated by paper production in industrial landfills.
    In the part of the paper production process, i.e. in its subsystem for wastewater
    treatment, a significant amount of solid waste is generated, which ends up in
    industrial landfills. The reason for the impossibility of returning to the production
    process lies in the fact that the sludge contains larger amounts of moisture and
    present chemical components that are isolated in the paper production process
    or during wastewater treatment. In the experimental part of the paper, a &ldquo;trial
    plot&rdquo; was selected on which seedlings of the paulownia elongate plant were
    planted in the waste sludge. The process of plant growth was monitored for two
    years and bioremediation, i.e. transfer of elements from sediments to plants,
    was analysed by modern instrumental methods. Based on the results obtained by
    research, it can be said with certainty that Paulownia elongate can be used in
    bioremediation of areas where these sediments are deposited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
