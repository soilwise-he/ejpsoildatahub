  title: A study on plant nutrition balance, soil fertility and economic returns of
    investments
  abstract: "Plant nutrition balance plays a major role in the universal need to increase\
    \ food production to meet the demands of the growing world population. Fertilizer\
    \ application resulted in marked crop yield increases, which for most crops were\
    \ more than hundred. The extent to which fertilizers are used still differs considerably\
    \ between various regions of the world. Soil nutrient status is widely constrained\
    \ by the limited use of inorganic and organic fertilizers and by nutrient loss\
    \ mainly due to erosion and leaching. Many small holder farmers do not have access\
    \ to synthetic fertilizer because of high price of fertilizers, lack of credit\
    \ facilities, poor distribution, and other socio-economic factors. Consequently,\
    \ crop yields are low, in fact decreasing in many areas, and the sustainability\
    \ of the current farming system is at risk. Therefore, the aim of this review\
    \ was to review the role of integrated Plant nutrition balance management for\
    \ improving crop yield and enhancing soil fertility under small holder farmers\
    \ in dry areas, and recommend the appropriate approaches for enhancing soil fertility\
    \ and increasing crop yield for small holder farmers in dry and semi-dry areas.\
    \ These are the key challenges of adoption in the scaling up of such alternative\
    \ soil fertility management practices to millions of small-scale farmers. There\
    \ is a need, therefore, for research and extension to sort out issues of adoption\
    \ and scaling up of the available options. In order to address soil fertility\
    \ problems, potential synergies can be gained by combining technical options with\
    \ farmers\u2019 knowledge as well as training of farmers and development agent\
    \ on new soil fertility management approaches. So, the results of this review\
    \ showed that, the integrated application of organic and inorganic fertilizers\
    \ improve productivity of crops as well as the fertility status of the soil. The\
    \ reasons for this are many, which include access or availability of inputs, use\
    \ of organic resources for other purposes in place of soil fertility, nutrient\
    \ balancing, collecting, transporting and management of organic inputs and economic\
    \ returns of investments."
