  title: 'Sustainable soil management measures: a synthesis of stakeholder recommendations'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil degradation threatens agricultural production and soil
    multifunctionality. Efforts for private and public governance&lt;br&gt;

    are increasingly emerging to leverage sustainable soil management. They require
    consensus across science, policy,&lt;br&gt;

    and practice about what sustainable soil management entails. Such agreement does
    not yet exist to a sufficient extent&lt;br&gt;

    in agronomic terms; what is lacking is a concise list of soil management measures
    that enjoy broad support among&lt;br&gt;

    all stakeholders, and evidence on the question what hampers their implementation
    by farmers. We therefore screened&lt;br&gt;

    stakeholder documents from public governance institutions, nongovernmental organizations,
    the agricultural industry,&lt;br&gt;

    and conventional and organic farmer associations for recommendations related to
    agricultural soil management&lt;br&gt;

    in Germany. Out of 46 recommended measures in total, we compiled a shortlist of
    the seven most consensual ones:&lt;br&gt;

    (1) structural landscape elements, (2) organic fertilization, (3) diversified
    crop rotation, (4) permanent soil cover, (5)&lt;br&gt;

    conservation tillage, (6) reduced soil loads, and (7) optimized timing of wheeling.
    Together, these measures support&lt;br&gt;

    all agricultural soil functions, and address all major soil threats except soil
    contamination. Implementation barriers&lt;br&gt;

    were identified with the aid of an online survey among farmers (n = 78). Results
    showed that a vast majority of farmers&lt;br&gt;

    (&gt; 80%) approved of all measures. Barriers were mostly considered to be economic
    and in some cases technological,&lt;br&gt;

    while missing knowledge or other factors were less relevant. Barriers were stronger
    for those measures that cannot be&lt;br&gt;

    implemented in isolation, but require a systemic diversification of the production
    system. This is especially the case for&lt;br&gt;

    measures that are simultaneously beneficial to many soil functions (measures 2,
    3, and 4). Results confirm the need for&lt;br&gt;

    a diversification of the agricultural system in order to meet challenges of food
    security and climate change. The shortlist&lt;br&gt;

    presents the first integrative compilation of sustainable soil management measures
    supporting the design of effective&lt;br&gt;

    public or private governance.&lt;/p&gt;'
