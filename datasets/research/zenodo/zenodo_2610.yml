  title: THE EFFECT OF ORGANO-MINERAL COMPOSTS ON THE FORGIVENESS OF ORGANO-MINERAL
    COMPOSTS IN SALTY SOIL CONDITIONS IN KARAKALPAKISTAN
  abstract: One of the important factors in obtaining high and high yields of agricultural
    crops and increasing soil fertility is the combined use of local and mineral fertilizers
    in scientifically based proportions. However, today there is a shortage of local
    and mineral fertilizers. In addition to filling such gaps, maintaining and increasing
    soil fertility, many studies have shown the use of non-traditional agricultural
    fertilizers, organic fertilizers, mainly compost, in addition to mineral fertilizers
    to increase the growth and productivity of the soil.
