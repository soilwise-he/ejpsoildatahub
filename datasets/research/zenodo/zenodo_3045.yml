  title: Change of Mn, Ni, and Zn concentrations in soils in the city center of Kastamonu
    and nearby by the use of soil
  abstract: Environment pollution, especially heavy metal pollution, became one of
    the most important problems of urban areas. Heavy metals in the air threatening
    human and environmental health pass to the soil after a while. Thus, soil is the
    medium, which can reflect the level of pollution at best. In the present study,
    among the heavy metals posing threat to human health, Mn, Ni, and Zn concentrations
    were determined in soil samples taken from 15 points, which had different characteristics,
    in the city center of Kastamonu province and the changes in these heavy metals
    by location were compared using statistical methods. As a result, it was determined
    that rather than anthropogenic factors, the concentrations of these heavy metals
    in the soil samples were shaped by the soil lithology.
