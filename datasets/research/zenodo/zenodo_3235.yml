  title: The Content Of Selenium And Heavy Metals In The Soil Of The Territory Of
    The Secondary School No. 14 In The Nefteyugansk Of The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous
    Okrug - Yugra
  abstract: "In the article the results of researches of analytical indicators of\
    \ soil samples on the territory of the secondary school no. 14 the city of Nefteyugansk\
    \ of the Khanty\u2013Mansi Autonomous okrug \u2014 Yugra. The article presents\
    \ the results of studies of selenium and antagonist elements: lead, copper, cadmium,\
    \ arsenic and zinc. The authors emphasize that the content of selenium in the\
    \ soil in the Nefteyugansk, Khanty\u2013Mansi Autonomous okrug \u2014 Yugra can\
    \ be attributed to calendarization. The amount of selenium does not change. It\
    \ was found that the content of heavy metals in the soil in this area varies widely.\
    \ This is due, first of all, to the acidic reaction environments of soils, their\
    \ low degree of mineralization and natural waters, as well as an increased content\
    \ of toxic elements \u2014 lead, arsenic and copper."
