  title: Assessing Constituents and Efficiency of Neem Seeds Powder (Azadirachtaindica
    A. Juss) modifying Soil physical and Chemical Properties
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em>\u2014</strong> <em>Neem is an indigenous tree\
    \ spreading over some tropical arid climatic area. The trees are carrying fruits\
    \ containing seeds. The importance of this study is to identify the benefits gained\
    \ from Neem seeds powder being applied as soil conditioner. The objective is to\
    \ estimate the inherent chemical components of Neem powder and eventually assess\
    \ its potential on decreasing soil pH values and salinity levels. Soil samples\
    \ were collected from College of Agricultural Studies, Sudan University of Science\
    \ and Technology (SUST). A total of 6 kilogram soil was taken at a depth of 0-30cm\
    \ from the soil surface, dried and grinded to pass 2mm sieve, divided equally\
    \ into 4 groups each of 1.5Kg (equivalent to 1500mg). The soil samples were analyzed\
    \ to determine their chemical and physical properties. Neem seeds were obtained\
    \ from Department of Integrated Pest Management that belongs to the Institution\
    \ of ENRDRI. Neem seeds are dried, grinded and kept under room temperature, further\
    \ used for determine their physical and chemical properties. To each subsoil sample\
    \ (1.5Kg.) and amount of 0g, 25g, 50g and 75g Neem seeds powder was added and\
    \ thoroughly mixed. Each of the 4 soils- Neem seeds powder mixture was subdivided\
    \ into 15 pots, each containing 10mg of the mixture. The experiment ended up with\
    \ 3 different treatments and the control. After 14 week incubation, the soil-\
    \ Neem mixtures were analyzed for pH and Ec. At 25% Neem seeds powder, pH recorded\
    \ values ranging from 7.22-7.99, and values of 7.47-7.89 were for Neem seeds powder\
    \ of 50% and 75% respectively. Variation in electrical conductivity among different\
    \ treatments recorded different values according to change in Neem seeds contents.\
    \ At 25%, electrical conductivity values ranged from 0.22-0.33, at 50% and 75%\
    \ recorded 0.17-0.28, and 0.17-0.28 respectively, while being 0.22-0.32 in the\
    \ control. Results showed that the soil pH and electrical conductivity have decreased\
    \ with increasing Neem seeds powder. Also on conclusion, the results indicated\
    \ that Neem seeds powder can be used as organic amendment for saline and alkaline\
    \ soil.</em>"
