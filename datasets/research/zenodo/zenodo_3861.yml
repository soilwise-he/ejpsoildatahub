  title: Afforestation Effect with Conifer and Hard Wood Species on some Physical
    and Chemical Soil Characteristics
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In long periods, afforestations have great effects on the physical
    and chemical soil characteristics. Preserving nutritions elements density of the
    soil in a balanced quantity in afforestated areas in order to consider the constant
    development principle is necessary and considerable negative changes shouldn&rsquo;t
    take place in soil characteristics.&lt;br&gt;

    This research compares the pure Pinus teada and blended local conifer afforestations
    on some soil characteristics in Azbarm Siyahkal area. Soil sample taking method
    was random-systematic and12 blended samples from hardwood afforestation and 12
    blended samples also from conifer afforestations were prepared from the depth
    of 0 to 30 cm and were transferred to the laboratory to determine the physical
    and chemical parameters (including: soil tissue, special apparent and superficial
    mass, pH, electrical conductivity, soil saturation humidity percentage, nitrogen,
    phosphor, potassium. calcium). The results showed that the amount of humidity
    saturation percentage, Carbon ratio to nitrogen and phospher among pinus teada
    species, Ace insigne and Alnus substrata and Quercus castaneifolia at the confidence
    level of 95% is significant. The humidity saturation percentage and phospher in
    hardwood stand was more in comparison with conifer and Carbon ratio to nitrogen
    in hardwood stand was less in comparison with conifer.&lt;/p&gt;'
