  title: Time Dependent Consolidation Properties of an Expansive Soil
  abstract: In this paper, different one-dimensional consolidation property is described.
    Analysis of different types of consolidation parameters and their behavior related
    with settlement are accomplished. Expansive soils show various behaviors due to
    same loading for different time intervals due to dissipation of excess pore-air
    and pore water pressure which inevitably results in volume reduction and thus
    the settlement occurs in expansive soils which results in very hazardous structural
    destruction. The time interval is increased here compared to other papers. However,
    in this paper, one dimensional consolidation test is accomplished for five different
    loading in different time intervals by using an odometer. The values of different
    consolidation parameters are obtained for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 days interval for
    each loading. The values show that the coefficient of permeability and the coefficient
    of consolidation have a linearly decreasing relationship with time. And the coefficient
    of compressibility and coefficient of volume compressibility have a linearly increasing
    relationship with time.
