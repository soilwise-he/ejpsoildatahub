  title: EFFECT OF AMENDMENT RESIDUE ON SOIL CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, YIELD POTENTIAL
    AND PROTEIN CONTENT IN SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX (L.) MERR)
  abstract: Biochar rice husks and cow manure as soil amendment have the potential
    to improve soil chemical properties such as soil pH, CEC, and several compounds
    such as C-organic, N-total and can fertilize the soil. This research is the third
    planting season, continued from the previous two planting seasons. The purpose
    of this study was to determine the effectof residual soil amendment in the third
    planting season on soil chemical properties, yield potential and protein content
    of soybean seed. From this research, the residue of soil amendment in the first
    planting season and the addition in the second planting season showed values that
    were not much different in each treatment both from the chemical nature of the
    soil and protein content. Soil pH, P-available and CEC tends to increase in residual
    cow manure 20 tons ha-1 and 10 tons ha-1 but not significant. Likewise with the
    potential for large yields in cow manure residues of 20 tons ha-1, another case
    with the highest crude protein content obtained in the control (R1) (without the
    soil amendment or fertilizer).
