  title: Different land use systems improve soil fertility status of sandy soil and
    increase the yield of rice under rain-fed wet lowland tropical climatic conditions
    in Papua New Guinea
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>The pratical\
    \ use of different land use systems(LUS) as a management strategy and the effect\
    \ of the LUSon soil proprties as an indicator of soil fertility status, and the\
    \ understanding of the long-term effect of the LUS, are important to maintaining\
    \ optimal soil fertility and yeild of crops. In the rain-fed wet lowlandtropical\
    \ soils, studies related to rice production and the associated effectson soil\
    \ properties are limited to a few studies. In this study, we investigated the\
    \ effects of four LUS (crop rotation, continuous cropping, manure application\
    \ and fallow) on soil properties that influence soil fertility status and yield\
    \ of crops under a rain-fed wet lowland tropical sandy soil conditions.The data\
    \ were compared with the natural soil data obtained prior to and at the end of\
    \ the study. All the LUS had no to small effects on bulk density, moisture content,\
    \ electrical conductivity and pH.Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available\
    \ phosphorus, extractable potassium, and cation exchange capacity were all higher\
    \ in all the LUS.Crop rotation increased soil organic carbon and cation exchange\
    \ capacity, fallow increased total nitrogen, and manure application increased\
    \ available phosphorus and extractable potassium contents, respectively.The LUS\
    \ had no significant effects on particle composition except that small increases\
    \ in the silt contentswere observed in the continuous, rotation and fallow systems.\
    \ In almost all cases, soil organic carbon content influenced the fertility status\
    \ of the sandy soil and yield of rice. Higher soil organic carbon contentresulted\
    \ in higher available phosphorous and extarvale potassium,enhence reulted in higher\
    \ yield of rice but decreased the total nitrogen content.Our results implied that\
    \ the soil organic carbon content of sandy soils needs to be managed properly\
    \ for optimal soil fertility and higher yieid</em><em>.</em>"
