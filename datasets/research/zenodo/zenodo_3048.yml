  title: Soil nematodes in the rhizosphere of a metal accumulating plant in a pollution
    gradient from a non-ferrous metal factory in Bulgaria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Nematodes were studied at sites with low, medium and high level\
    \ of soil metal contamination in the area of a non-ferrous metal plant. Soil total\
    \ metal concentrations ranged from values below their maximum permissible concentrations\
    \ (MPC) in soil to 48, 44, 16 and 4 times higher than the MPC for Cd, Pb, Zn and\
    \ Cu, respectively.\_ Nematodes were isolated from\_uncultivated, monoculture\
    \ stands of the metal accumulating mustard weed (&lt;em&gt;Lepidium draba &lt;/em&gt;L.,\
    \ Brassicaceae) in April, May and June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Overall, 55\
    \ nematode genera were identified during the investigation: 50 genera at low,\
    \ 39 at medium, 37 at high levels of soil metal pollution. Several nematode diversity\
    \ measures and the specific responses of some nematode genera differentiated the\
    \ three investigated sites. Both nematode richness (S) and diversity (H') of genera\
    \ correlated negatively with the soil metal concentrations in the following order:\
    \ Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Zn&gt;Cu. Several genera (&lt;em&gt;Alaimus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cylindrolaimus&lt;/em&gt;,\
    \ &lt;em&gt;Paramphidelus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scutylenchus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Steinernema&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ were common at the least contaminated site and were either rare or not found\
    \ at the rest of the sites. Some genera (&lt;em&gt;Clarkus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Filenchus&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ were most abundant at the medium level of contamination. The abundance of eleven\
    \ genera correlated negatively with the metal concentrations in the samples. Most\
    \ of the negative correlations (&lt;em&gt;Acrobeles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Coslenchus&lt;/em&gt;,\
    \ &lt;em&gt;Geomonhystera&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Plectus&lt;/em&gt;) were in the\
    \ following order: Cd&gt;Zn&gt;Pb&gt;Cu. The abundance of nine genera correlated\
    \ positively with the metal concentrations and most of their correlations were\
    \ in the order: Cu&gt;Pb&gt;Zn&gt;Cd.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Faunal profile analyses\
    \ of the free living nematode assemblages revealed higher values of Structure\
    \ index (SI) at low (75\u201391%) and medium (77\u201387%) levels of contamination\
    \ in comparison with the most polluted site (35\u201346%). Nematode structure\
    \ metabolic footprints (SFP) at low and medium levels of contamination were much\
    \ higher than at the high pollution level. Both SI and SFP at the medium level\
    \ of metal contamination indicated low bioavailability and low toxicity of Pb\
    \ (1290 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil), Cd (34 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil),\
    \ Zn (1779 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil) and Cu (190 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;soil)\
    \ for the free-living nematodes, isolated from the rhizosphere of the mustard\
    \ weed at this site. The rhizosphere of the metal accumulating plant might be\
    \ protective for these nematodes, providing conditions of reduced bioavailable\
    \ metals in contaminated soil during the vegetation period of the plants.&lt;/p&gt;"
