  title: Effect of Leachate Presence on Shear Strength Parameters of Bentonite-Amended
    Zeolite Soil
  abstract: Over recent years, due to increased population and increased waste production,
    groundwater protection has become more important, therefore, designing engineered
    barrier systems such as landfill liners to prevent the entry of leachate into
    groundwater should be done with greater accuracy. These measures generally involve
    the application of low permeability soils such as clays. Bentonite is a natural
    clay with low permeability which makes it a suitable soil for using in liners.
    Also zeolite with high cation exchange capacity can help to reduce of hazardous
    materials risk. Bentonite expands when wet, absorbing as much as several times
    its dry mass in water. This property may effect on some structural properties
    of soil such as shear strength. In present study, shear strength parameters are
    determined by both leachates polluted and not polluted bentonite-amended zeolite
    soil with mixing rates (B/Z) of 5%-10% and 20% with unconfined compression test
    to obtain the differences. It is shown that leachate presence causes reduction
    in resistance in general.
