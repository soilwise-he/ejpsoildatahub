  title: Determining the influence of physical nonlinearity of soil strength properties
    on the estimated base resistance
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The paper has examined the potential of using nonlinear models\
    \ of strength in determining the initial critical load on soil, as well as the\
    \ standardized and estimated base resistance, which makes it possible to reduce\
    \ labor intensity in the process of determining the strength properties of soils.&lt;/p&gt;\n\
    \n&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis and generalization of results from theoretical\
    \ studies into geomechanical processes using analytical mathematical methods,\
    \ the formula modifications have been derived that are intended for determining\
    \ the initial critical load on soil, as well as the standardized and estimated\
    \ base resistances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have established interrelation between\
    \ strength, in particular specific cohesion, and the angle of internal friction,\
    \ which are included in the strength conditions by Mohr-Coulomb and A.&nbsp;Shashenko,\
    \ thereby making it possible to improve the procedure for calculating external\
    \ loads on soil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dependences of critical loads on base\
    \ on the mean pressure under the sole of the foundation haven been analyzed in\
    \ the range of pressure&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;\u0420&lt;/em&gt;=100...500&nbsp;kPa using\
    \ the strength conditions by Mohr-Coulomb and A.&nbsp;Shashenko.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\
    &lt;p&gt;It has been established that when using generally accepted estimation\
    \ formulae to determine the critical loads on base, it is required that the pressure\
    \ range should be taken into consideration at which the properties of soil strength\
    \ were determined. In this case, using the Shashenko failure criterion to determine\
    \ critical loads on base makes it possible to properly consider the impact exerted\
    \ by the mean pressure on them under the sole of the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to dependences used currently in the Ukrainian, Belarusian,\
    \ Russian regulatory documents, as well as in other countries&rsquo; standards,\
    \ the resulting formulae make it possible to take into consideration the dependences\
    \ of soil strength properties on the mean pressure on soil under the sole of the\
    \ foundation. The results obtained make it possible to improve the reliability\
    \ of determining the initial critical load on soil, as well as the standardized\
    \ and estimated base resistances. This is achieved by taking into consideration\
    \ the nonlinearity of the Mohr limiting circles&rsquo; envelope using the strength\
    \ condition by A.&nbsp;Shashenko&lt;/p&gt;"
