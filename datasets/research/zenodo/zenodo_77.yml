  title: Soil management effects on soil organic matter properties and carbon sequestration
    (SOMPACS)
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;SOMPACS is a project recommended by EJP SOIL for funding under\
    \ the 1st External Call \"Towards Healthy, Resilient and Sustainable Agricultural\
    \ Soils\". The goal of this project is to assess management practices that enrich\
    \ organic matter pools that are resilient to rapid microbial decomposition. The\
    \ project started in 2022 as a consortium of 12 research institutions from Poland,\
    \ Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, UK, Italy and USA for a period of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soil\
    \ and vegetation samples from eight long-term experiments that differ in soil\
    \ management practices (i.e.,\_conventional vs. no-tillage; mineral vs. organic\
    \ fertilization; with and without catch crop; and arable land vs. undisturbed\
    \ grassland) are investigated. Study sites include: 22- and 54-year long experiments\
    \ in Lithuania; 26-year long experiment in Italy; 30- and 40-year long experiments\
    \ in Ireland; 30- and 46- and 100-year long experiments in Poland; and 178-year\
    \ long Broadbalk experiment in Great Britain. Additional experimentation includes\
    \ assessing the impact of root growth promoting amendments (commercially available\
    \ humic substances, biochar and biogas digestate) on stable organic matter pools.\
    \ In parallel with soil sampling, plant productivity are measured in all field\
    \ experiments. This investigation is couples fields studies with small-scale experimental\
    \ plots and laboratory incubations under controlled conditions. In addition to\
    \ assessing basic soil properties, the following state-of-the-art analyses are\
    \ conducted:&lt;/p&gt;SOM composition and stability by Py-GC-MS;fractionation\
    \ of aggregate size classes and C pools of increasing physicochemical protection;isotopic\
    \ analysis of \u03B413C and \u03B415N performed on different SOM pools;microbiological\
    \ properties (community-level physiological profiling, selected functional genes\
    \ involved in C and N cycles, microbiome and mycobiome analyses by next-generation\
    \ sequencing, genetic diversity using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism);enzymatic\
    \ activity;soil water retention and soil water repellency;mineral composition\
    \ of clay fraction; (8) soil structure stability.&lt;p&gt;The most resistant SOM\
    \ pool (humin) are isolated by different methods (isolation vs. extraction) and\
    \ examined for chemical composition and structure, using spectrometric and spectroscopic\
    \ techniques (mass spectrometry, NMR, FTIR, EPR, UV-Vis-NIR, fluorescence). The\
    \ carbon stocks in the soil profile will be evaluated and the carbon extractable\
    \ in cold water will be determined to assess the potential carbon leaching and\
    \ microbial availability. Additionally, in-field soil carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)\
    \ fluxes from selected experiments is monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far, soil\
    \ samples (0-100 cm depth) were collected and the humin fraction from surface\
    \ A horizon was isolated for spectroscopic studies. Crop yield and vegetation\
    \ productivity was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was financed\
    \ by NCBR (EJPSOIL/I/78/SOMPACS/2022).&lt;/p&gt;"
