  title: The Effect of Mulching on Soil Moisture Retention and Yield of Lettuce (Lactuca
    Sativa L.)
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>An experiment\
    \ was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different mulching materials\
    \ on soil moisture retention and yield of lettuce at the greenhouse located at\
    \ Luyengo campus of the University of Eswatini during the months of January and\
    \ February, 2019. The treatments consisted of grass mulch (GM), Plastic mulch\
    \ (PM), leaf debris mulch (LM), and no mulch (NM) which was used as a control.\
    \ Each of the treatments had four replications. The organic mulch was applied\
    \ at a thickness of 10 cm, and the plots for experiments were randomly selected.\
    \ Each plant received 600 cm<sup>3</sup> of water every 3 days using a homemade\
    \ drip irrigation system (equivalent to 6 mm per irrigation circle). Data on soil\
    \ moisture content was collected using the gravimetric method every 3 days (before\
    \ irrigation).The growth parameters of the lettuce plants that were collected\
    \ weekly were plant height, leaf number and leaf area. Both wet weight and dry\
    \ weight yield were determined for each plot at the end of the experiment (six\
    \ weeks after planting). Data collected was coded and entered into SPSS computer\
    \ software. Data analysis was conducted using the analysis of variance (ANOVA)\
    \ and the least significance difference (LSD) test to determine if means were\
    \ significantly different. The results showed that GM treatment had high mean\
    \ moisture retention at 9.3%. It was followed by PM and LM at 8.9%. The lowest\
    \ moisture retention was realized from the control (No mulching) at 7.9%.The differences\
    \ in mean moisture retention was significant between NM and NM (p&lt;0.05). The\
    \ same pattern was observed for the growth parameters, where GN had highest values\
    \ and the control had the lowest values. The wet mass yield was highest for GM,\
    \ at 164.7 g. The yield from LM was 149.3 g. It was followed by PM at 141.3 g.\
    \ The lowest yield was obtained from the control at 108 g. The difference in mean\
    \ yields for GM and NM were significant (p&lt;0.05). They were not significantly\
    \ different for all the other treatments (p&gt;0.050. It was concluded from the\
    \ experiment that grass mulching resulted in improved moisture retention and high\
    \ yields. </em>"
