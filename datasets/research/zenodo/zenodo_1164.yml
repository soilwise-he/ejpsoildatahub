  title: 'Volume estimation of soil stored in agricultural terrace systems: A geomorphometric
    approach'
  abstract: 'High-resolution topographic (HRT) techniques allow the mapping and characterization
    of geomorphological<br> features with wide-ranging perspectives at multiple scales.
    We can exploit geomorphometric information in the<br> study of the most extensive
    and common landforms that humans have ever produced: agricultural terraces. We<br>
    can only develop an understanding of these historical landform through in-depth
    knowledge of their origin,<br> evolution and current state in the landscape. These
    factors can ultimately assist in the future preservation of such<br> landforms
    in a world increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities. From HRT surveys,
    it is possible to<br> produce high-resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from
    which important geomorphometric parameters<br> such as topographic curvature,
    to identify terrace edges can be extracted, even if abandoned or covered by<br>
    uncontrolled vegetation. By using riser bases as well as terrace edges (riser
    tops) and through the computation of<br> minimum curvature, it is possible to
    obtain environmentally useful information on these agricultural systems<br> such
    as terrace soil thickness and volumes. The quantification of terrace volumes can
    provide new benchmarks<br> for soil erosion models, new perspectives to stakeholders
    for terrace management in terms of natural hazard and<br> offer a measure of the
    effect of these agricultural systems on soil organic carbon sequestration. This
    paper<br> presents the realization and testing of an innovative and rapid methodological
    workflow to estimate the<br> anthropogenic reworked and moved soil of terrace
    systems in different landscapes. We start with remote terrace<br> mapping at large
    scale and then utilize more detailed HRT surveys to extract geomorphological features,
    from<br> which the original theoretical slope-surface of terrace systems were
    derived. These last elements were compared<br> with sub-surface information obtained
    from the excavations across the study sites that confirm the reliability of<br>
    the methodology used. The results of this work have produced accurate DTMs of
    Difference (DoD) for three<br> terrace sites in central Europe in Italy and Belgium.
    Differences between actual and theoretical terraces from<br> DTM and excavation
    evidence have been used to estimate the soil volumes and masses used to remould
    slopes.<br> The utilization of terrace and lynchet volumetric data, enriched by
    geomorphometric analysis through indices<br> such as sediment conductivity provides
    a unique and efficient methodology for the greater understanding of<br> these
    globally important landforms, in a period of increasing land pressure.'
