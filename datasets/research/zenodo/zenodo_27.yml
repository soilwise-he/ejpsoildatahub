  title: Soil Nutrient Analyses
  abstract: "Soil supports the rooting system of the plants. It is extremely important\
    \ as it stores nutrients essential for plant growth and prosperity and to determine\
    \ its future nutrient content. The nutrients are classified as macronutrients\
    \ (<em>e.g.</em> nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) which are elements that plants\
    \ require in large amounts. In contract, micronutrients (<em>e.g.</em> Manganese,\
    \ Zinc, Boron) are required in smaller amounts by the plant. Too many macronutrients\
    \ in soil often interfere with micronutrient availability; thus, a balance is\
    \ very important. Soil nutrient analyses must be conducted before and during all\
    \ cultivating period to evaluate nutrient possible uptake from the plants. More\
    \ specifically: \xB7 NO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>\
    \ provide nitrogen which plays many roles in plants, such as among other, affects\
    \ leaf development and chlorophyll production. \xB7 Phosphorus is an essential\
    \ nutrient both as a part of plant structure compound, and as a key player in\
    \ biochemical reactions. It is a vital component of DNA, RNA and ATP, which is\
    \ an energy unit for vital plant processes. \xB7 Potassium is taken up in significant\
    \ amounts by crops and is essential in almost all processes needed to sustain\
    \ plant growth and reproduction."
