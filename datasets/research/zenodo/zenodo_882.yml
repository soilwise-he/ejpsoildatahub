  title: Soil Liquefaction Potential Maps for Earthquake Events in Yangon, Myanmar
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The soil liquefaction is one of the main topics of geotechnical
    engineering associated with the strong earthquakes. The study area has been selected
    in Yangon City because it is most populated density area and located near the
    active faults and the rivers. The main objective of study is the development of
    liquefaction potential maps as a prominent feature for site planners and decision
    makers to reduce loss of lives. The borehole data including ground water table,
    Standard Penetration Test SPT , blow counts, wet density and fine content etc.
    have been collected from the 530 representative sites in Yangon City. The safety
    factor of soil liquefaction is evaluated by using National Center of Earthquake
    Engineering Research NCEER Method 1997 . The Liquefaction Potential Index LPI
    is proposed by Luna and Frost Method 1998 to predict the potential of liquefaction
    at sites. The proposed liquefaction potential map is analyzed by using Geographic
    Information Software. The development of liquefaction potential maps is associated
    with 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 of probabilities of exceedance in 50 years. Zar Lee
