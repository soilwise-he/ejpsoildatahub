  title: A Risk of Soil Degradation
  abstract: The organic matter of soil is degrading day by day. In recent decades,
    it has become very intense as the country's population has increased. One-quarter
    of species on planet earth lives in soils. It is predicated that around 27000
    species of life forms are becoming extinct every year due to loss of habitat.
    The main causes of soil degradation are deforestation, removal of natural vegetation,
    converting forests to farms, degrading marginal lands and other agriculture related
    activities.
