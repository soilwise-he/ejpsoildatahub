  title: 'A simplified model for size and shape of microplastics in soil: implications
    for risk assessment and particle measurement'
  abstract: "Microplastics (plastic particles \xA1 5 mm, MP) have become known mainly\
    \ for their impact on aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, microplastic exposure in\
    \ soil and potential effects on edaphon have been examined only recently. Unfortunately,\
    \ probabilistic risk assessment and fate modelling is so far hindered by the lack\
    \ of continuous representations of size and shape. Hence, the aim of this work\
    \ was to simplify these properties of microplastics in soil using probability\
    \ density distributions. To parametrize them, a literature survey was done. In\
    \ total, 28 studies were found to be eligible, from which empirical data was extracted.\
    \ Nonetheless, we were unable to obtain a particle size distribution for microplastics\
    \ in soil, because sufficient data for modeling was only found in 14 % of the\
    \ included studies. They showed that frequency either decreased or increased with\
    \ particle size, resulting in a regression coefficient between -1.33 and 1.10,\
    \ depending on sampling site. This finding questions whether particle size of\
    \ microplastics in agricultural topsoils follows a power law, which is the case\
    \ for microplastics in aquatic environments. The shape of microplastics was predominantly\
    \ classified as fibers, that had a proportion of 40 %, followed by 23 % irregular\
    \ particles, 15 % films, 4 % pellets, and 3 % foams. From this, Corey\xB4s shape\
    \ factor was derived, that followed a with a bimodal-like mixture of two normal\
    \ distributions. Overall, this shape distribution was comparable to the one for\
    \ microplastics in aquatic ecosystems, but with a higher amount of films, that\
    \ most likely originated from mulch films used in agriculture. Altogether, our\
    \ study can only provide preliminary model parameters for size and shape of microplastics\
    \ in soil. To overcome this, open data on comprehensive measurements of individual\
    \ plastic particles from all soil types around the world and from different layers\
    \ is urgently needed. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/426908/document"
