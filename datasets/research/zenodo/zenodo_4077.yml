  title: A preliminary study of the content and distribution of pesticide residues
    in soil samples from the Kathmandu valley, Nepal
  abstract: "The increasing use of pesticides for agricultural production is causing\
    \ soil pollution problems in different parts of Nepal. Uncontaminated agricultural\
    \ soils are of great importance as they have a direct impact on food security\
    \ and human health. The objective of this study was to investigate the quality\
    \ and quantity of pesticides in soil samples from districts near the capital city\
    \ of Kathmandu, from where fruit and vegetables are brought to the city for consumption.\
    \ A questionnaire survey was carried out in four districts around Kathmandu city\
    \ to investigate the types of pesticides that are most commonly used in these\
    \ districts. A total of 15 soil samples were taken at a depth of 10 cm and four\
    \ complete soil profiles were sampled at three different depths (10 cm, 30 cm\
    \ and 50 cm) on the farms of those who were interviewed. A total of four replicates\
    \ of each soil sample were extracted and analyzed. The pH, soil texture and organic\
    \ carbon content of the soil samples were analyzed to understand the general soil\
    \ characteristics. The QuEChERS method used for the analysis of food samples was\
    \ modified and applied to the soil samples. An HPLC-MS/MS was used for the qualification\
    \ and quantification of the pesticide residues in the soil samples. The questionnaire\
    \ survey revealed that carbendazim, chlorpyrifos-methyl, parathion-methyl, imidacloprid,\
    \ metalaxyl, dimethoate, omethoate and dichlorvos were the most commonly used\
    \ pesticides in the area studied. The chemical analysis showed that soil samples\
    \ from all the districts except Kathmandu city were contaminated with various\
    \ pesticides. The soil samples collected at the depth of 10 cm were found to be\
    \ contaminated with the fungicide carbendazim and the insecticide chlorpyrifos-methyl\
    \ at rates of up to 0.038 mg kg-1 and the systemic insecticide imidacloprid was\
    \ found at up to 0.016 mg kg-1. !e study of soil samples taken at different depths\
    \ (10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm) showed that pesticides were homogenously distributed\
    \ with soil depth. !e recovery between 77.5-112%, linearity between 0.01 mg kg^{-1}\
    \ - 2 mg kg^{-1} with correlation factors R^2 higher than 0.99 and LOQ between\
    \ 0.2 \xB5g kg^{-1}- 6.25 \xB5g kg^{-1} were found. Some samples were contaminated\
    \ with parathion-methyl, a highly carcinogenic organophosphorous insecticide,\
    \ even though these pesticides had already been banned. For the first time, this\
    \ study provides information about soil contamination levels due to pesticides\
    \ in Central Nepal and shows that further research and information campaigns for\
    \ farmers are necessary."
