  title: "On the Control of Soil Heterogeneity, P\xC3\xA9clet Number and Spatially\
    \ Variable Diffusion Over Unsaturated Transport"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Physical properties of soils are ubiquitously heterogeneous. This spatial
    variability has a profound, yet still partially understood, impact on conservative
    transport. Moreover, molecular diffusion is often a disregarded process that can
    have an important counter-intuitive effect on transport: diffusion can prevent
    non-Fickian tailing by mobilizing mass otherwise trapped in low velocity zones.
    Here, we focus on macroscopically homogeneous soils presenting small scale heterogeneity,
    as described by the Miller-Miller theory. We then analyze the dynamic control
    of soil heterogeneity, advection and diffusion on conservative transport. We focus
    especially on the importance of diffusion and of its tortuosity-dependent spatial
    variability on the overall transport. Our results confirm previous finding that
    relatively high P&eacute;clet number systems are highly sensitive to the degree
    of heterogeneity, which promotes non-Fickian transport. Also, diffusion appears
    to have a profound impact on transport, depending on both the degree of heterogeneity
    and the P&eacute;clet number. For a high P&eacute;clet number and a very heterogeneous
    system, diffusion leads to the counter-intuitive decrease of non-Fickian spreading
    described previously. This is not observed for a low P&eacute;clet number due
    to the impact of the spatial variability in the diffusion coefficient, which appears
    to be a significant controlling factor of transport by promoting or preventing
    the accumulation of mass in low velocity zones. Globally, this work (a) highlights
    the complex, synergistic effect of soil heterogeneity, advective fluxes and diffusion
    on transport and (b), alerts on potential upscaling challenges when the spatial
    variability of such key processes cannot be properly described.&lt;/p&gt;'
