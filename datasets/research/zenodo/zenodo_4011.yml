  title: THE EFFECT OF SOIL AMENDMENT TO NUTRIENT UPTAKE OF MAIZE AND YIELD IN THE
    SECOND PLANTING SEASON.
  abstract: One of the potential soil texture for agriculture activity was sandy soil.
    But, there was needed some technology to improve the quality of sandy soil especially
    physical and chemical properties. Biochar was a stable carbon product which produced
    from the pyrolysis processed of organic matter. The addition of biochar was expected
    to be an alternative solution for physical, chemical properties and increase soil
    organic carbon and water availability. The experimental was aimed to determine
    the effect of soil amendment from rice husk, rice husk biochar, and cow manure
    to nutrient uptake of maize and yield of maize during the second planting season.
    The research was conducted in ACIAR experimental site, Aceh Besar district, Aceh
    province, Indonesia. The experimental design was completely randomized design
    non-factorial with three replications. The rates of soil amendment were rice husk
    biochar5 t ha-1 and 10 t ha-1, rice husk 5 t ha-1 and 10 t ha-1, and cow manure
    10 t ha-1 and 20 t ha-1. The rates of soil amendment before was given the addition
    fertilizer like N and K, 50% NPK fertilizer recommendations and without NPK as
    a control. The results showed that the rates of 20 t ha-1 cow manure added N and
    K fertilizer was giving the best effect to maize growth, the rates of 10 t ha-1
    cow manure added N and K fertilizer was giving the best effect to maize yield,
    and the rates of 10 t ha-1 and 5 t ha-1 soil amendment with the addition of N
    and K fertilizer, and the rates of 10 t ha-1 cow manure with the addition of N
    and K were giving the best effect to N uptake. But, the application of soil amendment
    was not significant to P and K plant uptake
