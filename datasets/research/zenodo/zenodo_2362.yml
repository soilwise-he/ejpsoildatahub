  title: 'Model updating of a masonry tower based on operational modal analysis: The
    role of soil-structure interaction'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Vibration-based finite element model (FEM) updating of cultural
    heritage assets is gaining so much attraction these days since destructive tests
    are usually not allowed to be performed. In this study, a framework for developing
    three-dimensional (3D) FEMs is proposed using 3D laser scanners and applied on
    Slottsfjell tower, a stone masonry tower in T&oslash;nsberg, Norway. Operational
    modal analysis (OMA) was done based on the ambient vibration testing (AVT) data
    to define the frequency values and corresponding mode shapes of the tower. Mechanical
    properties of the t&oslash;nsbergite stone were utilized to derive the base values
    of the material properties of the homogenized masonry for performing sensitivity
    analysis and FEM updating. To investigate the effect of the soil-structure interaction
    (SSI) on the FEM updating results, three FEMs are developed. The fixed-base model
    is the FEM without considering the SSI effects, and two other FEMs are developed
    using the substructure and direct methods for simulating the SSI effects. Sensitivity
    analysis was performed to investigate the effective parameters on the dynamic
    characteristics of the models. FEM updating was conducted on the three FEMs, and
    results are compared to each other to show the role of the SSI on the FEM updating
    results. The resonance effect can cause damage to buildings located even in low
    seismicity zones. For this aim, the risk of resonance effect has been evaluated
    for the tower. Finally, linear dynamic analysis was performed on the three calibrated
    models, and the results were compared to each other.&lt;/p&gt;'
