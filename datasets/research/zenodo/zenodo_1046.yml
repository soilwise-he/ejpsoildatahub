  title: EFFECT OF MINERAL AND ORGANIC FERTILIZATION ON SOME SOIL PHYSICAL TRAITS
  abstract: A field experiment was conducted in Babylon province, Al-Mussaib project
    during the summer season of 2020. The study included two levels of NPK mineral
    fertilization (without fertilization, mineral fertilization) and according to
    the recommended for fertilizing the sunflower crop and two levels of organic fertilization
    (without organic fertilization, organic fertilization) at an average 6 kg of decomposed
    sheep manure for each experimental unit before planting and three levels of biological
    fertilization (without fertilization, bio fertilization soaking seeds, injecting
    the soil with biomaterial) (Bio Halth). Where the seeds were soaked and mixed
    well with bio fertilizer before cultivation for the second level, as well as the
    plants were injected with bio fertilizer after germination for the third level,
    The seeds were sown on June 1, 2020, American Flame cultivar, originating on a
    furrow, with a distance of 75 cm between one furrow and another, and 25 cm between
    a pit and another .To know the effect of mineral, organic and biological fertilization
    on some physical properties of soil, the one replicate included 12 treatments
    distributed randomly on the experimental plot. The number of the experimental
    plot was 36 panels with dimensions of 3 x 4 m, leaving intervals between sectors
    2 m and between the experimental units 1m. Soil samples were taken from the field
    at the harvest stage. Samples of field soil were taken before cultivation, at
    a depth of 0-30 cm, and mixed well with each other to homogenize them and make
    a compound sample of them, and then they were air-dried and crushed and passed
    through a sieve with a capacity of 2 mm and a part of them was taken for laboratory
    analyzes to know some of the physical properties of the study soil before cultivation.
    The results of the experiment showed that there were significant differences between
    the averages of the studied traits in the presence of the mineral, organic and
    biological fertilization process. Organic fertilization gave the best averages,
    as it reached 50.45%, 1.32 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 24.44 mm, and 1.26 mm for the traits
    of concentration, porosity, bulk density, soil aggregate stability, and average
    Mean weight diameter compared to the control treatments which amounted to 43.71%,
    1.51 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 13.15 mm and 0.88 mm respectively .As for the biological
    fertilization, it gave the best averages for the water conductivity, which amounted
    to 11.51 cm.h<sup>-1</sup>, compared to the control treatment, which amounted
    to 9.10 cm.h<sup>-1</sup>. The bi-interactions were significant for all soil properties,
    and the bi-interaction between mineral and organic fertilizers gave the best averages
    in most soil characteristics, which amounted to 1.40 mm and 1.24 g/cm3 for the
    weighted diameter average and bulk density, respectively, while the mineral and
    biological fertilizers gave the best average in the porosity that amounted to
    52.56%. As for the organic fertilization with the biological, it gave the best
    average in the bulk density trait, as it reached 1.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the
    triple interaction was significant for all traits.
