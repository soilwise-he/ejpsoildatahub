  title: Effect of tomato hybrids to different growing media and fertigation on soil
    properties under naturally ventilated polyhouse
  abstract: 'The present investigation was conducted to study the response of different
    growing media and fertigation on yield and yield attributes of tomato in different
    tomato hybrids (Avtar, Rakshita and Naveen 2000 plus). This experiment was conducted
    at the Research Farm of Department of Agricultural Engineering, CSK Himachal Pradesh
    Krishi Vishvavidyalaya, Palampur during summer season of 2013 and 2014 under naturally
    ventilated polyhouse. The research trial was laid out with treatments comprising
    three hybrids (Avtar, Rakshita and Naveen 2000 plus), three fertigation levels
    (NPK @ 20:20:20 g/m2, NPK @ 25:25:25 g/m2 and NPK @ 30:30:30 g/m2) and two growing
    media (vermicompost and cocopeat: vermicompost) with randomized block design (RBD)
    and three replications. The data recorded for both the years i.e., 2013 and 2014.
    The recorded soil pH and organic carbon was not affected significantly by different
    hybrids, fertigation levels and growing media. Maximum available nitrogen (289.5
    kg/ha in 2013 and 295.1 kg/ha in 2014), phosphorous (25.7 kg/ha in 2013 and 27.0
    kg/ha in 2014) and potassium (262.0 kg/ha in 2013 and 270.9 kg/ha in 2014) in
    the soil were observed at NPK @ 30 g/m2which were significantly higher than NPK
    @ 25 g/m2and NPK @ 20 g/m2. Different hybrids and growing media during both the
    years could not exhibit any significant effect on available nitrogen, available
    phosphorus and available potassium of soil after the harvest of tomato crop'
