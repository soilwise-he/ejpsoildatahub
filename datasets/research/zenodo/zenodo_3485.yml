  title: Soil Respiration Rate Of Laurel-Leaved And Cryptomeria Japonica Forests
  abstract: "We assessed the ecology of the organic and mineral soil<br>\nlayers of\
    \ laurel-leaved (BB-1) and Cryptomeria japonica (BB-2 and Pw)<br>\nforests in\
    \ the Kasugayama Hill Primeval Forest (Nara, Japan). The soil<br>\nrespiration\
    \ rate was higher in the deeper horizons (F and H) of organic<br>\nlayers than\
    \ in those of mineral soil layers, suggesting organic layers<br>\nmay be where\
    \ active microbial metabolism occurs. Respiration rates in<br>\nthe soil of BB-1,\
    \ BB-2 and Pw forests were closely similar at 5 and 10\xB0C.<br>\nHowever, the\
    \ soil respiration rate increased in proportion to<br>\ntemperatures of 15\xB0\
    C or above. We therefore consider the activity of<br>\nsoil microorganisms to\
    \ markedly decrease at temperatures below 10\xB0C.<br>\nAt a temperature of 15\xB0\
    C or above, the soil respiration rate in the BB-1<br>\norganic layers was higher\
    \ than in those of the BB-2 and Pw organic<br>\nlayers, due to differences in\
    \ forest vegetation that appeared to<br>\ninfluence several salient soil properties,\
    \ particularly pH and the carbon<br>\n(C) and nitrogen (N) content of the F and\
    \ H horizons."
