  title: A STUDY BETWEEN STRUCTURAL CORRELATION &amp;MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SUB-GRADE
    SOIL WHEN BLENDED WITH LIME AND RICE HUSK ASH
  abstract: Present study considers structural characterization of sub-grade soil
    to increase the strength of soil for road. The present investigation has been
    carried out with agricultural waste materials like Rice Husk Ash individually
    mixed with soil and also in combination with different percentage of Hydrated
    Lime. Structural and mechanical characterization of the investigated samples was
    performed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Standard Proctor
    Test, Unconfined Compression Test, California Bearing Ratio (CBR)Test. It was
    observed that increase of strength may be due to the reduction of mica in the
    soil sample. Increase of the silica in the soil sample finally increases the strength
    and stability. Microstructural study revealed that the mica phase may play very
    important role for maintaining the strength and stability of the soil.
