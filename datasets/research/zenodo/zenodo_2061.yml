    of majority of rural dwellers in Nigeria has suffered a huge setback due to mostly
    total neglect and abandonment by successive government coupled with climatic variations
    and unsuitable soil management practices employed by the household farmers, and
    thus the essence of this study; economic implication of climate change and soil
    management practices in Nigeria. The devastating impacts of climate change in
    Nigeria cannot be ruled off with its significant evidences across the agro-ecological
    zones. The havoc caused by variations in climate change is second to none. These
    impacts have been felt virtually across all sectors of the economy namely health,
    security, energy, transportation, agriculture, etc. However, in as much as climate
    change poses adverse effects in Nigeria, its positive side though highly debatable
    cannot be ruled out for instance, rising temperatures and heat waves in most cases
    activate and aid soil microbial organisms, thus enhancing soil aeration, soil
    structure and texture which further aid and support agricultural production of
    the household farmers. Greater attention is thus being given to intensification
    of sustainable soil management technologies. Key benefits of these technologies
    are; increasing food production without depleting soil and water resources, restoring
    soil fertility, increasing the resilience of farming systems to climatic risk,
    and improving their capacity to sequester carbon and climate change mitigation.
    Conclusively, farmers should embraced climate change mitigation strategies and
    adaptative principles and incorporate efficient and effective soil management
    techniques to forestall future climatic occurrences and boost farm production
    and income. <strong>Keywords: </strong>Agriculture, Economic Impacts, Climate
