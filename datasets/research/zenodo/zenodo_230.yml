  title: Soil and irrigation research in Canterbury
  abstract: "A one-day workshop, with 58 participants (Appendix) and sponsored by\
    \ the New Zealand Society of Soil Science, was held at Lincoln on Thursday 1<sup>st</sup>\
    \ March 2012. The aims of the workshop were: To current research and opportunities\
    \ for future soils research with respect to irrigation in Canterbury To bring\
    \ soils researchers and industry representatives with irrigation expertise together\
    \ to enable networking discussions. During the day there were 27 presentations,\
    \ each of 5 minutes duration, organised into three themes: How can we tailor irrigation\
    \ schemes to land/soil resources? Do we have the knowhow to conduct on-farm irrigation\
    \ sustainably? Do we understand the soil processes to allow sustainable land management\
    \ under irrigation? The large number of presentations highlighted that there is\
    \ a good level of active soil research related to irrigation, across a range of\
    \ organisations. There is also breadth in this research, ranging from landscape-scale\
    \ analyses of irrigation schemes, to paddock-scale management technologies, down\
    \ to processes driving nitrogen and microbe leaching. Following each presentation\
    \ theme there was a discussion forum to identify the general state of knowledge,\
    \ with topics assigned to one of three categories: agreed, debated, and gaps.\
    \ All results are presented in this report. Overall participants agreed most about\
    \ the current knowledge status in themes two and three, with considerably less\
    \ agreement about current knowledge at the landscape scale (theme one). Greatest\
    \ debate took place within themes one &amp; two, with a lot of research gaps identified\
    \ across all three themes. Some of the knowledge gaps that were repeatedly identified\
    \ included: There is still a need to better understand the fate of both water\
    \ and nutrients in the environment. Our current knowledge of shallow and stony\
    \ soils commonly was considered inadequate. There is a need for improved understanding\
    \ of soil physical changes under irrigated conditions. Systems modeling was seen\
    \ as important and a number of opportunities identified, but it was recognised\
    \ that there were a number of areas where the current models needed to be refined.\
    \ We need to further improve our knowledge of soil water relations (and associated\
    \ function) to tailor irrigation schemes to specific soil and land resources.\
    \ We need to find ways to improve how we feed science into policy. Extension of\
    \ existing research knowledge was also commonly identified as a general gap. At\
    \ the end of the workshop the participants were asked to fill out a survey of\
    \ current and desired professional interactions, with a social networks analysis\
    \ of this survey presented at the end of this report. This analysis shows there\
    \ is a high level of existing professional networking, but only a smaller group\
    \ that had previously interacted in co-authoring of scientific papers, which probably\
    \ reflects both the breadth of research disciplines as well as the good turnout\
    \ of non-scientist participants. Overall, feedback from the participants was very\
    \ positive and encouraging and all agreed that the aims of the workshop had been\
    \ met. One of the most positive outcomes was that there was a high desire for\
    \ new professional interactions, and participants wanted to see the workshop repeated\
    \ in the future. We recommend that given the rapid rate of change in Canterbury\
    \ irrigation that a repeat workshop is held in 1\u20132 years\u2019 time. A worthwhile\
    \ initiative would be to hold a pan agency collaboration initiative in late 2012\
    \ / early 2013 where opportunities for collaborative projects could be identified,\
    \ prior to the 2013\u201314 financial year. For the Crown Research agencies, this\
    \ report should be presented to those involved in the Soil Land Use Alliance (SLUA)\
    \ initiative, which is aiming to co-ordinate research and funding applications\
    \ across the different agencies. A one-day workshop, with 58 participants (Appendix)\
