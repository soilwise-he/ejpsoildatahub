  title: Major Nutrients Requirement of Amaranthus cruentus L. on Two Soil Types in
    Lagos State of Nigeria
  abstract: Soils from Ikorodu (Orthic Luvisol) and Lagos State University (LASU)
    Ojo campus (Dystric Fluvisol) were used in greenhouse experiments to determine
    N, P and K requirement of Amaranthus cruentus L. using five rates of NPK 15:15:15
    at 0, 150, 300, 450 and 600 kg ha1. The experiment was arranged in a completely
    randomized design with four replications. Soil treated with 300 and 450 kg ha-1
    NPK 15:15:15 significantly (p&lt;0.05) enhanced plant height number of leaves
    shoot fresh and dry weight and plant N-uptake compared to other treatments at
    Ikorodu. Corresponding values were obtained from soil treated with 450 and 600
    kg ha-I NPK 15:15:15 at LASU. Optimum N, P and K requirements for A. cruentus
    at Ikorodu and LASU were 45.0 and 67.5 kg N/ha-1 respectively.
