  title: 'Optimizing Soil Health Management in Smart Agriculture: Deep Learning Algorithms
    for Nutrient Analysis and Fertilizer Recommendation with Precision Agriculture
    Systems'
  abstract: Today, technology makes the management of soil health the key to sustainable,
    high-yield agriculture. This article discusses a new approach using artificial
    intelligence and deep learning to understand the nutrients needed in the soil
    and provide fertilizer guidelines for advanced agriculture. We are using modern
    agricultural techniques, coupled with artificial intelligence, to develop a new
    way to protect soil that is more convenient, accurate and intelligent. Our study
    uses complex soil data to accurately predict soil water scarcity. We found a special
    algorithm. In addition, we have proposed an AI-driven fertilizer recommendation
    system that can customize different solutions for different soils. This research
    not only aligns AI with the practical needs of agriculture, but also creates new
    and more useful technologies for future smart agriculture innovations, promoting
    more advanced smart agriculture, fewer environmental risks, and smarter sustainable
    development.
