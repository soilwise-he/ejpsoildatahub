  title: THE DISINFESTATION OF SOIL IN GREENHOUSES
  abstract: "<em>The energy method of soil disinfection of greenhouses from pests\
    \ and pathogens of vegetable crops has been studied and proposed in Gorsky State\
    \ Agrarian University. As a coolant, it is recommended to use ionized water steam,\
    \ pre-treating the soil with a cutter with a diameter of 25\u202630 mm lumps or\
    \ cells with a diameter of 16\u202620 mm. High quality of disinfection is ensured,\
    \ when using water ionized steam as a coolant, the time of soil heating is reduced\
    \ by on average of 1,5 times, the steam consumption reduces by 35...40%, the heat\
    \ utilization coefficient is increased by 1,3 times compared with the use of non-ionized\
    \ steam as a coolant.</em> <strong><em>Key words</em></strong><em>: decontamination\
    \ of soil, pests and pathogens, bioindicators, coolant, ionized steam, the thermal\
    \ conductivity, the heating of the soil, the steam condensation front, rotary\
    \ hoe, cutter.</em>"
