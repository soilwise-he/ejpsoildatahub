  title: Hydroxyapatite-activated seaweed biochar for enhanced remediation of fluoride
    contaminated soil at various pH ranges
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the defluoridation efficiency of hydroxyapatite-activated
    seaweed (&lt;em&gt;Eucheuma Cottonii&lt;/em&gt;) biochar (HSB) at various soil
    pH ranges (3&ndash;11) while monitoring the impact of contact time (30 min - 2.5
    h), adsorbent dosage (0.1&ndash;0.5 g) as well as the initial fluoride concentration
    and compare its performance to its respective seaweed biochar (SB). Activation
    of SB with the hydroxyapatite lead to a shift in its point-zero-charge (pHPZC)
    from 6 to 7.4 broadening its defluoridation pH range from a solitary 5 to amid
    3 through 11. The fluoride adsorption mechanism was found to follow both Langmuir
    (R2 = 0.956) and Freundlich (R2 = 0.942) isotherm models with a maximum defluoridation
    capacity of 3.03 mg/g equivalent to the defluoridation efficiency of 79%. This
    is accounted to the existence of soil ions, SB active sites, and the attached
    hydroxyapatite, as fluoride adsorption sites each exhibiting a dissimilar fluoride
    removal mechanism. Therefore, the HSB could be a promising adsorbent for fluoride
    removal in the fluoride contaminated agricultural soils of inclusive pH ranges.&lt;/p&gt;'
