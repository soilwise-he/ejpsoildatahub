  title: Simple Methods of Extracting Boron for Assay of Available Soil Boron
  abstract: This article 'Simple Methods of Extracting Boron for Assay of Available
    Soil Boron' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series, created
    by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective of
    this publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with
    the development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems.
    This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the production
    of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce
    nations in the world.
