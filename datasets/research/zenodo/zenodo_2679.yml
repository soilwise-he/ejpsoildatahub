  title: 'Estimation of Soil Moisture Content in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo-State
    Using Remote Sensing Technique: 2017 Study'
  abstract: <em>Soil moisture estimation is essential for optimal water and soil resource
    management. Surface soil moisture is an important variable in the natural water
    cycle, which plays an important role in the global equilibrium of water and energy
    due to its impact on hydrological, ecological and meteorological processes. Soil
    moisture changes due to the variability of soil characteristics, topography, and
    vegetation in time and place and affects vegetation distribution. Too little moisture
    can result in yield loss and plant death and too much causes root disease and
    wasted water. Soil moisture measurements are performed directly using in situ
    methods and indirectly, using transfer functions or remote sensing. Since in-situ
    measurements are usually costly and time-consuming in large areas, we can use
    methods such as remote sensing to estimate soil moisture at very large scales.
    The purpose of this study is to estimate soil moisture using land surface temperature.
    In this work, ground temperature was calculated using Landsat-8 thermal infrared
    band for Oredo Local Government Area and was used to estimate the soil moisture
    of the study area using ArcGIS (Arc-map 10.2.2). The study revealed places with
    low, moderate and high moisture contents with the moderate moisture index being
    dominant in both seasons. This study will thus serve as a database that will enable
    farmers to embark on precision farming with the local government area under investigation.
