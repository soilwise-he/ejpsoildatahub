  title: Rhizosphere pH and Phosphatase Activity in Orthic Allophanic Soil Under Pinus
    radiata Seedlings Grown with Broom and Ryegrass
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Under &nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pinus radiata &lt;/em&gt;plantations &nbsp;where
    &nbsp;the tree spacing&nbsp; is wider &nbsp;and most soils are phosphorus &nbsp;(P)
    deficient, &nbsp;the radiata &nbsp;tree response to P fertilizer is expected&nbsp;
    to be more influenced &nbsp;by&nbsp; the interaction between &nbsp;the applied
    &nbsp;P fertilizer, the tree and understorey vegetation. &nbsp;Therefore, &nbsp;a
    better understanding of the soil P chemistry under radiata pine trees in association
    &nbsp;with &nbsp;other &nbsp;plants&nbsp; is required. &nbsp;We investigated &nbsp;the
    effect of broom &nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;Cytisus scoparius &lt;/em&gt;L.) and ryegrass
    &nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;Lolium multiflorum) &lt;/em&gt;grown &nbsp;with &nbsp;radiata
    &nbsp;seedlings &nbsp;in Orthic Allophanic Soil treated with&nbsp; 0, 50, and
    100 &mu;g P g-1 &nbsp;soil of TSP on the pH and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere
    soils under glasshouse condition. The pHs of radiata rhizosphere soils either
    grown with broom or grass were lower than &nbsp;those in the &nbsp;bulk soils
    and the bulk and rhizosphere soils of grass and broom, &nbsp;whether &nbsp;they&nbsp;
    were grown &nbsp;alone or grown &nbsp;with radiata at the &nbsp;applications of
    50 and 100 &mu;g P g-1 soil. These results suggest that P application enhanced
    root induced acidification &nbsp;in a P-deficient Allophanic Soil under radiata.
    &nbsp;The soils in the rhizosphere of grass and broom, grown in association with
    radiata, were also acidified by&nbsp; the effect of radiata &nbsp;roots. &nbsp;Acid
    &nbsp;phosphatase &nbsp;activity in soils under &nbsp;radiata, &nbsp;grass and
    broom &nbsp;decreased with &nbsp;an increased &nbsp;rate of P application. At
    all P rates,&nbsp; acid phosphatase activity was higher in the rhizosphere of
    radiata &nbsp;grown &nbsp;with &nbsp;broom than in the bulk soils. The phosphatase
    activity in the rhizosphere soil of radiata grown with broom was also higher than
    that of radiata grown with grass, but it was slightly lower than that in the rhizosphere
    of broom grown &nbsp;alone. These results suggest that broom may have also contributed
    to the higher &nbsp;phosphatase &nbsp;activity in the rhizosphere soils than&nbsp;
    in the bulk &nbsp;soils of broom &nbsp;and radiata when they were grown &nbsp;together&lt;/p&gt;'
