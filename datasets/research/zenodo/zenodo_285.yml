  title: Synergistic Effect of Organic, Inorganic and Biofertilizers on Soil Microbial
    Activities in Rhizospheric Soil of Green Pea
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;To study the effect of incorporation of organic, inorganic and\
    \ biofertilizers on rhizospheric microbial population and enzyme activities at\
    \ various time intervals in pea crop, the experiment was laid in randomized blocked\
    \ design in triplicate with plot size of 7 \xD72.5 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; using\
    \ Punjab-88 variety. Study was conducted during winter season of 2015-16 in field\
    \ of Department of Agronomy, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India.\
    \ Enumeration of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, diazotrophs, PGPR and PSB was\
    \ done on Nutrient Agar medium, Glucose Yeast Extract medium, Kenknight\u2019\
    s medium, Jensen\u2019s medium, King\u2019s B medium and NBRIP medium respectively,\
    \ using serial dilution spread plate technique. Activities of soil enzymes (Alkaline\
    \ phosphatase, Urease and Dehydrogenase) were studied. Significantly higher total\
    \ bacterial population (150 \xD710&lt;sup&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;CFU g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ of soil) and PGPR (218 \xD710&lt;sup&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;CFU g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ of soil) population was observed in treatments when there was combination of\
    \ organic, inorganic and consortium biofertilizer. Actinomycetes remained unaffected\
    \ with different fertilizers. Biofertilizer used in combination with FYM resulted\
    \ in significantly higher population of fungi (20 \xD710&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;CFU\
    \ g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of soil), diazotrophs (140 \xD710&lt;sup&gt;5 &lt;/sup&gt;CFU\
    \ g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of soil) and PSB (80 \xD710&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;CFU\
    \ g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of soil). Among rhizospheric soil enzyme activities,\
    \ alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher in treatment with FYM\
    \ +consortium biofertilizer while dehydrogenase activity was higher in treatment\
    \ with inorganic fertilizer +FYM +consortium biofertilizer. Urease activity showed\
    \ a variable pattern during different time intervals. Microbial activities were\
    \ also affected by different stages of plant growth. Total bacterial population\
    \ showed positive correlation with enzyme activities during initial stages of\
    \ plant growth but showed negative correlation with urease activity during late\
    \ stages of plant growth. Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers\
    \ resulted in improved soil microflora leading to significantly higher enzyme\
    \ activities which were further enhanced by inoculation of biofertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;"
