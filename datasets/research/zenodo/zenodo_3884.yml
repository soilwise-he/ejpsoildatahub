  title: INVESTIGATION INTO THE SETTLEMENT OF A CASE STUDY BUILDING ON LIQUEFIABLE
    SOIL IN ADAPAZARI TURKEY
  abstract: "This paper investigates the key parameters that influenced the settlement\
    \ of a case study building on liquefiable soil in Adapazari (Turkey) during the\
    \ 1999 Kocaeli earthquake. Ground movements in Adapazari caused large devastation,\
    \ largely attributed to liquefaction of low plasticity silty soil layers underneath\
    \ buildings on shallow foundations. The case study soil profile was well characterized\
    \ by in-situ testing as well as laboratory tests from the Adapazari area. This\
    \ allowed several different estimates of the building settlement to be obtained\
    \ through different methods and through a variation in upper and lower bound estimates\
    \ of the soil parameters. The different methods and different soil properties\
    \ caused scattered estimates for the building settlement, compared to the in-situ\
    \ value of 0.9 m. Even though the results were varied, the estimation of the liquefied\
    \ strength of the soil appeared to be a key parameter for the settlement of the\
    \ case study of building. A detailed study with the PLAXIS finite-element software\
    \ and UBCSAND constitutive model, provided a consistent estimate of the final\
    \ settlement of 0.9 m compared to the in-situ value. However, the limitation due\
    \ to the enforced \u201Cundrained\u201D conditions during the dynamic phase of\
    \ the analyses may have resulted in an inaccurate simulation of the pore water\
    \ pressure and subsequently could have influenced the estimation of settlement.\
    \ The modeling of the liquefaction settlements under free-field conditions was\
    \ also considerably less than the re-consolidation settlements that were obtained\
    \ through simplified procedures, suggesting that the re-consolidation settlement\
    \ under the foundation was not modeled accurately. The present paper focuses on\
    \ the assessment of the settlements due to earthquake\u2013induced liquefaction\
    \ as part of the research being conducted within the European project LIQUEFACT."
