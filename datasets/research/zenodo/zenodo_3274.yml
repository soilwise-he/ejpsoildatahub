  title: Comparative Study on The Determination of Some Major, Minor-Essential and
    Toxic Metals From Two Species of Cactus Fruit (Opuntia Ficus Indica and Opuntia
    Stricta ) and Their Supporting Soil Samples Cultivated in Two Zones of Tigray,
    Northern Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A comparative study was carried out for the determination of
    some selected metals (K, Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn, Cd and Pb) in fruits of two cactus
    species (Opuntia ficus indica and Opuntia stricta) and supporting soil from two
    zones of Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. After digestion with microwave acid
    digestion, some selected metals were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.
    The concentration of metals obtained for these fruits are found to be within the
    range of WHO and other international guideline limits. Levels of the metals concentration
    in this study is that, in all the fruit samples, K &gt;Ca &gt; Mg in concentration
    and the levels of trace metals are, Zn &gt; Mn &gt; Cu &gt; Ni. Concentrations
    of Cd and Pb are below the method detection limit in all the fruit samples. The
    metals concentration between the two species (Opuntia ficus indica and Opuntia
    stricta) cultivated in the same zone are not significantly different (p = 0.05).
    In the comparison of metals concentration of same species cultivated in different
    zones, the concentrations of K, Ca and Zn in fruit and soil are significantly
    higher in Southeastern zone than Eastern zone. Concentrations of Mg in Opuntia
    ficus indica and soil are significantly higher in Southeastern zone than Eastern
    zone. The concentrations of Mn in fruit and soil are significantly higher in Eastern
    zone than Southeastern zone. Concentrations of Mg in Opuntia stricta, concentrations
    of Ni in both fruits and soil and concentrations of Cu in both fruits are not
    significantly different in these two zones, but soil of Southeastern zone is significantly
    higher in Cu concentration than Eastern zone.&lt;/p&gt;'
