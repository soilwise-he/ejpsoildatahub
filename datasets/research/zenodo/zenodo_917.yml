  title: Soil fungal communities of ectomycorrhizal dominated woodlands across West
    Africa
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Forests and woodlands in the West African Guineo-Sudanian transition
    zone contain many tree species that form symbiotic interactions with ectomycorrhizal
    (ECM) fungi. These fungi facilitate plant growth by increasing nutrient and water
    uptake and include many fruiting body-forming fungi, including some edible mushrooms.
    Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning and anthropogenic use, diversity
    and distribution of ECM fungi is severely under-documented in West Africa. We
    conducted a broad regional sampling across five West African countries using soil
    eDNA to characterize the ECM as well as the total soil fungal community in gallery
    forests and savanna woodlands dominated by ECM host tree species. We subsequently
    sequenced the entire ITS region and much of the LSU region to infer a phylogeny
    for all detected soil fungal species. Utilizing a long read sequencing approach
    allows for higher taxonomic resolution by using the full ITS region, while the
    highly conserved LSU gene allows for a more accurate higher-level assignment of
    species hypotheses, including species without ITS-based taxonomy assignments.
    We detect no overall difference in species richness between gallery forests and
    woodlands. However, additional gallery forest plots and more samples per plot
    would have been needed to firmly conclude this pattern. Based on both abundance
    and richness, species from the families Russulaceae and Inocybaceae dominate the
    ECM fungal soil communities across both vegetation types. The community structure
    of both total soil fungi and ECM fungi was significantly influenced by vegetation
    types and showed strong correlation within plots. However, we found no significant
    difference in fungal community structure between samples collected adjacent to
    different host tree species within each plot. We conclude that within plots, the
    fungal community is structured more by the overall ECM host plant community than
    by the species of the individual host tree that each sample was collected from.&lt;/p&gt;'
