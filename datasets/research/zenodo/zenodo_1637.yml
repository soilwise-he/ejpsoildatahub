  title: YIELD RESPONSE TO ELEVATED SOIL BORON IN WHEAT CULTIVARS OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN
    ORIGIN
  abstract: The two-year field study was aimed to investigate the effect of increasing
    soil boron treatments (3.3, 6.7 and 13.3 g H3BO3/m2) on eight wheat cultivars,
    as well as to estimate the rate in which yield decreases followed the increase
    in soil boron. A strong positive linear relationship was found between the treatments
    and soil hot water extractable boron. On average, wheat yield response to elevated
    soil boron was decrease of 7.7%. Cultivars of local origin over-yielded foreign
    cultivars at all levels of boron supply. The estimated yield loss was 1.8% per
    increase in soil boron of 0.1 ppm.
