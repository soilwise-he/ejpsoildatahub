  title: Analysis of high plasticity clayey soil improvement at subgrade level through
    Portland cement added to decrease volumetric change
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This research includes the potential for resistance and the
    expansion that the soil presents, this evaluation was carried out through CBR
    tests. The soil cement technique was used to improve the physical and mechanical
    characteristics; this process consists in mixing the material with Portland cement
    type I. That combination forms soil cement 10%, 15% y 20%, which present an increase
    of the CBR (max: 138.7% and min: 91.9%) achieving a type of extraordinary subgrade
    to resist the structure of the pavement and a reduction of 7.18% in the expansion
    of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;'
