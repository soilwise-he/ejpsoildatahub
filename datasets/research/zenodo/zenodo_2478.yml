  title: Determination of Total Soil Nitrogen and Organic Carbon from Certain Infra-Red
    Peaks of IR-Curves of Soils
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-211002. <em>Manuscript\
    \ received </em>14 <em>February </em>1975 ; <em>accepted </em>23 <em>June </em>1975\
    \ Fifty soil samples from different regions of India have been collected and their\
    \ infrared curves were observed by KBr-mull technique using Perkin-Elmer Spectrophotometer,\
    \ 137. The depth (I/I<sub>0</sub>) values of each infrared absorption peaks were\
    \ calculated and correlated with the values of total soil nitrogen and carbon\
    \ separately. Generally, Si-OH (bonded and unbonded water-peak), Si-OH (absorbed\
    \ water-peak) ; Si-O (silica-peak) ; Si-H (pH-peak) and Si-C (carbon-peak) belonging\
    \ to different infrared regions have been found to show their correlation (both\
    \ positively or nega\xADtively) with the values of total soil N and C. Regression\
    \ (straight line) equations were also obtained between the I/I<sub>0</sub> values\
    \ and the N and C percent values, which may be used for routine analysis of these\
    \ two soil constituents."
