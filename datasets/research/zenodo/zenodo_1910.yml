  title: Study of Stress- Strain Behaviour of Cohesive Soil Mixed With Granite Dust
    under Triaxal Test
  abstract: "One of the most important characteristics in construction which is widely\
    \ used in connection with road pavements and foundation is soil stabilization.\
    \ In other to enhance the engineering properties of the soil, stabilization techniques\
    \ is required. The addition of waste materials like, fly ash, rice husk ash etc.\
    \ increases the physical as well as chemical properties of the soil. Some of the\
    \ expected properties to be improved are shear strength, liquidity index, plasticity\
    \ index, unconfined compressive strength and bearing capacity. One of the primary\
    \ objective of this research is to analyse the effect of granite dust on cohesive\
    \ soil. This research studied the application of granite dust material on the\
    \ geotechnical properties of soil. For the purpose of study, three soil samples\
    \ at different location were collected and considered. All test in raw soil and\
    \ treated/stabilized soil were performed at The Polytechnic, Ibadan soil laboratory.\
    \ The soil were collected from location at Sango-Ojoo Road, Ijokodo-Apete Road,\
    \ and UI-Ajibode Road Ibadan, Oyo State. Nigeria, with the coordinates of Latitude\
    \ 7.45708, (N7o27\u201925.48\u201D), Longitude 3.90869 (E 3o54\u201931.29\u201D\
    ), Latitude 7.44603 (N 7o26\u201945.70\u201D), Longitude 3.87602, (E 3o52\u2019\
    33.67\u201D) and Latitude 7.43509, (N7o24\u201942.47\u201D), Longitude 3.76253,\
    \ (E 7o23\u201945.35\u201D) respectively. The granite dust was collected from\
    \ the RCC Quarry site, within Ibadan for the stabilization studies. The experimental\
    \ program were carried out on the samples treated with different percentages of\
    \ granite dust at 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8%. The research depicts the study carried\
    \ out to check the improvements in the strength properties of soil stabilization\
    \ by granite dust in varying percentages. The dry density of the soil increases\
    \ with addition of granite dust at varying percentages and a corresponding decrease\
    \ in the moisture content. The test carried out shows that there is an improvement\
    \ in the strength properties of the soil as a result of an increase in the cell\
    \ pressure with an increase in the granite dust proportion. It is therefore concluded\
    \ that granite dust is an effective stabilizer which can be used as additive to\
    \ improve geotechnical properties of cohesive soil when necessary. However, no\
    \ assumption should be made that granite dust should be considered as suitable\
    \ stabilizer for all type of soil until they are tested with the sample."
