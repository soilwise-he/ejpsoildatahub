  title: Analysis Of Electrical Safety Conditions Taking Into Account Soil Conductivity
    Determined On The Basis Of Fuzzy Logic
  abstract: "The goal of this work is to prove a possibility of determining soil parameters\
    \ that influence its conductivity being the basis of grounding, step voltage and\
    \ touch voltage calculation. This in its turn increases the safety level of electric\
    \ equipment operation. The article is devoted to development of new, no conventional\
    \ models of soil conductivity using the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.\
    \ The description of the solution includes the following sections: fuzzy models\
    \ of specific electrical resistance of different soil types depending on their\
    \ salinity and moisture content at positive temperatures; dependences between\
    \ \u03C1 and negative temperature values for different types of soil and different\
    \ moisture contents; fuzzy climatic soil models for a specific location in order\
    \ to determine soil \u03C1 deep into the earth throughout the year. Uncertainty\
    \ of soil properties is a reason why calculations of grounding devices are very\
    \ liberal with plenty to spare, and calculations of touch voltages and step voltages\
    \ in the period of active snow melting or abundant rains give erroneous results.\
    \ Since soil parameters are described by linguistic variables: humidity, salinity,\
    \ and temperature etc., soil layers should be considered as overlapping fuzzy\
    \ sets. Membership functions of the main components of the \u201Csoil conductivity\u201D\
    \ concept were formed on this basis. The new scientific result we obtained makes\
    \ it possible to formalize natural language of the experts in the field of climatic\
    \ factors influence on soil resistivity in order to represent this information\
    \ with the help of computer algorithms for optimum design of energy supply security\
    \ and step voltage and touch voltage calculation."
