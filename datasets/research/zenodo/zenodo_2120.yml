  title: Evaluation of Soil Oxide Mineralogy in Different Bedrock Lithologies in the
    Southern Guinea Savannah of Nigeria
  abstract: Agriculture has very important social and economic footprint in Africa.
    Its soil resource is however threatened by degradation resulting from mismanagement,
    due to lack of knowledge on important soil functional properties such as mineralogy,
    which impact many soil processes. This study was therefore conducted to access
    variations in soil oxide mineralogy in soils formed from differing bedrock lithologies.
    Soil sampling was carried out on soils from three different bedrock types; basement
    complex rocks, recent alluvium, and Nupe sandstone in Kwara state, southern Guinea
    Savannah of Nigeria. Data was subjected to analysis of variance to determine significant
    differences in treatment means (p80 %). The highest mean percentage of 90.59 was
    recorded in recent alluvium-derived samples, while the least value of 80.75 %
    was recorded in basement complex-derived samples. Aluminum and iron oxides were
    the most saturating metal oxides in all the bedrock types, and significantly higher
    values of 5.65 % and 2.71 % for Al2O3 and Fe2O3 respectively were recorded in
    basement complex-derived soils. Dissimilar trends of mineral oxide relationships
    were observed in soils from the different lithologies, which are likely a result
    of bedrock characteristic, environmental and hydrologic factors. The relationships
    established between oxide minerals in this study could serve as a foundation for
    subsequent investigations into mineral interactions in the soils.
