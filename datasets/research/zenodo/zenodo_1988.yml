    124, Kerala, India <em>Manuscript received 03 December 2012, accepted 26 August
    2014</em> Nickel is one of the heavy metals exhibited greater migration properties
    which is frequently found in contaminated soil and ground water. The concentration
    of heavy metals in soil depends largely on sorption and desorption reaction on
    the surface of soil particles. So the objective of this work is to find out the
    adsorption, desorption and kinetics of sorption of nickel on four typical profile
    samples of different soil types of India. In all the studies the analysis of nickel
    ions was done using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, and the results were
    statistically analysed. Interpretation of results showed that the adsorption capacity
    of soil is closely related to the physico-chemical properties of soil such as
    organic matter, clay content, exchangeable cations and pH. The Freundlich adsorption
    isotherm was found to be better fit than Langmuir adsorption isotherm with respect
    to nickel adsorption. The Freundlich and Langmuir parameters were closely related
    to the difference in the nickel adsorption characterstics of soils. The desorption
    of nickel was rapid during the initial two extractions (more than 70%). Forest
    soil and laterite soil retained some fractions of adsorbed nickel even after eight
    successive extractions which shows the high sorption characteristics of these
    soils. The rate of adsorption of nickel was proportional to the concentration
    of nickel remaining unadsorbed at a given time irrespective of their initial concentration
    which indicated invariably their agreement with first order kinetics.'
