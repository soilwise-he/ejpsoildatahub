  title: Assessment of long-term wastewater irrigation impacts on the soil geochemical
    properties and the bioaccumulation of heavy metals to the agricultural products
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;An extensive field survey was employed for assessing the impacts of
    long-term wastewater irrigation of forage crops and orange orchards in three suburban
    agricultural areas in Cyprus (areas I, II, and III), as compared to rainfed agriculture,
    on the soil geochemical properties and the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Zn,
    Ni, Mn, Cu, Co) to the agricultural products. Both ryegrass fields and orange
    orchards in areas I and II were continuously wastewater irrigated for 10 years,
    whereas clover fields in area III for 0.5, 4, and 8 years. The results revealed
    that wastewater reuse for irrigation caused a slight increase in soil salinity
    and Cl&minus; content in areas I and II, and a remarkable increase, having strong
    correlation with the period in which wastewater irrigation was practiced, in area
    III. Soil salinization in area III was due to the high electrical conductivity
    (EC) of the wastewater applied for irrigation, attributed to the influx of seawater
    to the sewage collection network in area III. In addition, the wastewater irrigation
    practice resulted in a slight decrease of the soil pH values in area III, while
    a subtle impact was identified regarding the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe,&nbsp;and
    heavy metal content in the three areas surveyed. The heavy metal content quantified
    in the forage plants&rsquo; above-ground parts was below the critical levels of
    phytotoxicity and the maximum acceptable concentration in dairy feed, whereas
    heavy metals quantified in orange fruit pulp were below the maximum permissible
    levels (MPLs). Heavy metal phytoavailability was confined due to soil properties
    (high pH and clay content), as evidenced by the calculated low transfer factor
    (TF).&lt;/p&gt;'
