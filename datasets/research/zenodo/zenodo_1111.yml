  title: Mapping of soil degradation factors and their impacts on plant biodiversity
  abstract: To contribute to the knowledge of the factors of soil degradation and
    the loss of biodiversity in the corridors of the Benue National Park, the general
    objective of this work is to identify the factors of soil degradation and determine
    their impacts on plant biodiversity. Hence, it will it will be necessary to do
    an inventory on the factors of soil degradation in the corridors of the BNP; study
    between 2005 and 2015 by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
    the land use of the Areas of Hunting Interest in which the corridors are located
    and make inventory on the floristic diversity of the park. The transect method
    was used to identify soil degradation factors. The aerial mapping made it possible
    to highlight the different classes of land use as well as their areas. The floristic
    inventory carried out using the transect method made it possible to do a study
    on the distribution of the flora. Among the soil degradation factors inventoried,
    agriculture (74.22%) is practiced more in all corridors. It is followed by the
    town planning process (9.53%), carbonization (7.19%), pastoral practice (6.56%)
    and gold panning (2.50%). A satellite view showed an extension of land use from
    1.41% for bare soil to 36.57% (fields) to the detriment of the initial vegetation.
    The floristic inventory revealed an equitable distribution of vegetation according
    to their abundance. In view of these results, it is important to set up strategies
    for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity. It therefore seems urgent
    to undertake methods to restore these soils.
