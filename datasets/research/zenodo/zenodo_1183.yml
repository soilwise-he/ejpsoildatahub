  title: METHODOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDYING THE TRANSFER OF DISSOLVED MICROELEMENTS
    THROUGH SOIL SOLUTION
  abstract: <em>This article discusses the question of the significance of studying
    the transfer of dissolved trace elements through the soil solution from the point
    of view of methodology. Scientific information about chemical processes occurring
    in soils and the causes of environmental pollution with microelements has been
    transformed into educational information.</em>
