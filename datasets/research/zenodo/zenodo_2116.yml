  title: 'The MicroSof project: study of microplastic contamination in soil samples
    from 33 different sites in France'
  abstract: "To date, the majority of the research on microplastics (MP) has focused\
    \ on the marine environment. The pollution of continental ecosystems is comparatively\
    \ little studied, even though the majority of all plastics is used and disposed\
    \ on land. The main sources of plastic in soils include land application of contaminated\
    \ sewage sludge and compost, plastic mulching, wastewater irrigation, atmospheric\
    \ deposition, littering and surface runoff [1]. However, estimates of MP concentrations\
    \ and chemical natures are still limited and differ between studies. In France,\
    \ only a few studies have tackled the issue of MP contamination in soils. The\
    \ MicroSof project aims to establish first national references on the contamination\
    \ of French soils by microplastics. To do so, soil samples from 33 different sites\
    \ under different land uses were analyzed (crop lands, forests, grasslands and\
    \ vineyard/orchards). After pre-treatment and subsampling, the samples were digested\
    \ with Fenton's reagent following the methodology outlined by Hurley et al. (2018)\
    \ [2]. MP were then extracted by density separation with a sodium iodide (NaI)\
    \ solution. The study then allowed to quantify (number) and to qualify (chemical\
    \ nature) the accumulated plastic fragments, as well as the size and the shape\
    \ of these fragments. [1] M. Bl\xE4sing et W. Amelung, \xAB Plastics in soil:\
