  title: 'Biodegradation kinetics of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil environment using
    Mangnifera indica seed biomass: A mathematical approach'
  abstract: "The biodegradation crude oil in polluted soil using <em>Mangnifera indica</em>\
    \ seed biomass was investigated. The change in total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH)\
    \ concentration on the effect of the period of exposure with different dosage\
    \ of <em>M. indica</em> seed mesh introduced in the different containers were\
    \ examined and a decrease in TPH concentration was significant. The maximum specific\
    \ rate and equilibrium constants were determined and the results obtained revealed\
    \ that the values for room dried <em>M. indica</em> of various dosages at V<sub>max</sub>\
    \ 50\u201390 g, 500, 33,333.33, 50,000, 50,000, 27.78 (ppm/per day) and K<sub>S</sub>\
    \ 50\u201390 g, 0.5, 300, 2750, 1124.81 (ppm/per day) were observed. For sun-dried,\
    \ <em>M. indica</em> of various dosages at V<sub>max</sub> 50\u2013 90 g, , 1.6666.67,\
    \ , , 100.00 (ppm/per day) and K<sub>S</sub> 50\u201390 g, , 16.67, , , 300 (ppm/per\
    \ day) were recorded. The maximum specific rate and equilibrium constant was determined\
    \ using the Lineweaver Burk plots Theory as well as excel plot of linear polynomial\
    \ curve for comparison. Results revealed that the <em>M. indica</em> seed biomass\
    \ ha promising effeminacy for the degradation of THP in the contaminated soil."
