  title: Fine root morphology and soil properties / Soil Organic Matter Fractions
    in relation to root characteristics of different tree species in altitude gradient
    of Temperate Forest in Carpathian Mountains
  abstract: "These data were obtained from research plots located at altitudes of\
    \ 600, 800 and 1000 m above sea level. in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and fir (Abies\
    \ alba Mill.) stands. In this case, in each altitude variant, three research areas\
    \ with beech and fir were designated. The study was conducted in the Ja\u0142\
    owiec Massif (49\xB038\u2032 N, 19\xB020\u2032 E) in the Western Beskidy Mountains,\
    \ in the southern part of Poland. The study took place in Magurska Nappe on the\
    \ sandstone and shales, with domination of Cambisols (WRB, 2014). The study plots\
    \ were established at three different elevations (600, 800 and 1,000 m a.s.l.)\
    \ along a slope with an inclination of 15\xB0. The tested soils were characterised\
    \ by a similar texture (average sand content was 54%, silt 42% and clay 3%). The\
    \ average temperature of the growing season for the study plots was 12.4 \xB0\
    C at 600 m a.s.l., 11.3 \xB0C at 800 m a.s.l. and 10.2 \xB0C at an elevation of\
    \ 1,000 m a.s.l. Average soil moisture at 600, 800 and 1,000 m a.s.l. differed,\
    \ at 22.74%, 29.60% and 34.10%, respectively. Tree stands growing in the same\
    \ soil conditions were selected for the study. Tree stands of similar age and\
    \ with the same crown density were used for the research. Basic physicochemical\
    \ properties (pH, hydrolytic acidity, carbon and nitrogen content, basic cation\
    \ content) and the fractional composition of SOM were determined from the soil\
    \ samples. Additionally, we determined the basic characteristics of the roots\
    \ (diameter, length, biomass, distribution, production)."
