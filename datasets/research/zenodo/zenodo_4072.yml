  title: The Effectiveness Of Mineral Fertilization Of Winter Wheat By Nitrogen In
    The Soil And Climatic Conditions In The Cr
  abstract: 'The basis of examines is survey of 500 in the years

    2002-2010, which was selected according to homogeneity of land

    cover and where 1090 revenues were evaluated. For achieved yields

    of winter wheat is obtained multicriterial regression function

    depending on the major factors influencing the consumption of

    nitrogen. The coefficient of discrimination of the established model is

    0.722. The increase in efficiency of fertilization is involved in supply

    of organic nutrients, tillage, soil pH, past weather, the humus content

    in the subsoil and grain content to 0.001 mm. The decrease in

    efficiency was mainly influenced by the total dose of mineral

    nitrogen, although it was divided into multiple doses, the proportion

    loamy particles up to 0.01 mm, rainy, or conversely dry weather

    during the vegetation. The efficiency of nitrogen was found to be the

    smallest on undeveloped soils and the highest on chernozem and

    alluvial soils.'
