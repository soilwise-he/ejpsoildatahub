  title: "Dynamic Behavior Of Pile Group Model In Two \u2013 Layer Sandy Soil To Lateral\
    \ Earthquake Excitation"
  abstract: "The behavior of pile foundations under earthquake loading is an important\
    \ factor affecting the performance of such structures. Observations from past\
    \ earthquakes have shown that piles in stiff soils generally perform well, while\
    \ those installed in soft or liquefiable soils are more subjected to problems\
    \ arising from ground amplification or excessive soil movements.\n\n \n\nA series\
    \ of laboratory tests were conducted to measure the response of pile foundation\
    \ when subjected to dynamic loads. A special vibration box was manufactured. The\
    \ accompanied measurements include vertical and horizontal displacement and settlement\
    \ of pile cap, acceleration in three dimensions in both soil and cap and earth\
    \ pressures. The model pile used has an outer diameter of 18 mm and inner diameter\
    \ of 15 mm. A group of (2x2) piles was tested.\n\n \n\nIt was concluded that for\
    \ soil bed in dry state, the acceleration amplitudes increase with frequency for\
    \ both soil relative densities (loose and medium). The maximum acceleration in\
    \ the foundation is lower than in soil bed for all operating shaking frequencies\
    \ and soil states. The decreasing of the maximum acceleration recorded in the\
    \ foundation as compared to that in the soil bed is between 10-100 % for loose\
    \ and medium state of soil, and the decrease in loose state is more than in medium\
    \ state. This means that there is damping effect or attenuation of vibration waves."
