  title: Situational Analysis of Current Monitoring Systems for Eco-restoration (Soil
    Restoration and Water Resource Development) Projects in Agro-ecological Landscapes
  abstract: "Society for Promoting Participative Ecosystem Management (SOPPECOM) is\
    \ a non-profit, non-governmental organisation based in Pune, India, working in\
    \ the area of natural resources management, primarily in rural areas. The organisation\
    \ is committed to the principles of sustainable and rational use of natural resources,\
    \ equity, and social justice in the distribution of benefits, especially to disadvantaged\
    \ groups like Dalits, the landless, and women. As an organisation committed to\
    \ these principles, SOPPECOM extends its support to grassroots groups working\
    \ on NRM issues through training, resource literacy, participatory planning, research,\
    \ and policy advocacy. TMG Research gGmbH is a Berlin-based research organisation\
    \ working on sustainability issues in the areas of sustainable management and\
    \ responsible governance of land and oceans, food systems, and climate. As an\
    \ organisation, TMG brings sound knowledge and practical experience in facilitating\
    \ national, European, and international processes and is dedicated to the analysis\
    \ and solution of new and complex challenges. The following study commissioned\
    \ to SOPPECOM by the TMG Research group is a part of the SEWOH lab project. The\
    \ purpose of the SEWOH lab project is to analyse the linkages between digital\
    \ and social innovations for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2, and especially\
    \ to understand the potential of digital solutions for inclusive rural and agricultural\
    \ development in sub-Saharan Africa and India. Within this larger project, SOPPECOM\
    \ conducted the study under the Ecosystem Restoration Workstream: \u201CDigital\
    \ Tools to Cover the Last Mile in Restoration Monitoring.\u201D The study focussed\
    \ on two distinct work packages \u2013 i) Situational Analysis of current monitoring\
    \ systems:To understand existing tools (digital or otherwise) for monitoring and\
    \ impact assessment of SOC and soil health resulting from agricultural and farm\
    \ management practices; ii) Scoping study on the monitoring, verification, and\
    \ reporting in ecosystem landscape restoration: To assess, how the implementation\
    \ of programmes and projects in the field of ecosystem restoration is reported\
    \ to the state and national level in India. This report, \u201CSituational Analysis\
    \ of Current Monitoring Systems for Eco-restoration (Soil Restoration and Water\
    \ Resource<br> Development): Projects in Agro-ecological Landscapes\u201D presented\
    \ below is the synthesis of the research work done under work package one as mentioned\
    \ above. The study was done for five months from February to June 2022"
