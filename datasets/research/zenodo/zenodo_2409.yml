  title: Resistance Of Eggplant (Solanum Melongena L.) To Verticillium Wilt Correlates
    To Microbial Abundance And Soil Enzyme Activities
  abstract: 'Aims: To determine the relationship between microbial abundance and enzyme
    activities of rhizosphere soil from different resistant eggplant cultivars and
    resistance of eggplant to Verticillium wilt. Study Design: The changes of microbial
    and enzymatic activities of the rhizosphere soil from different resistant eggplants
    after inoculation of Verticillium dahliae were analysed. Place and Duration of
    Study: The plants were grown in a plastic greenhouse of the Vegetable Crops Experimental
    Station, and the laboratory experiments were conducted at the Horticulture College,
    Shenyang Agricultural University from August to November, 2008. Methodology: 14
    eggplant cultivars were selected and inoculated with Verticillium dahliae to screen
    their resistance against Verticillium wilt, and classified according the final
    disease index. The quantities of main cultivable microorganisms and some functional
    bacteria were investigated by the serial dilution method. Activities of oxidoreductase
    and hydrolase enzymes of rhizosphere soil were determined by spectrophotometry
    or colorimetric titrations. Results: The correlation analysis among resistance
    of eggplant to Verticillium wilt, microorganisms and enzyme activities showed
    that, the abundance of actinomyces, the ratios of bacteria to fungi and actinomyces
    to fungi, and the activities of catalase, polyphenol oxidase, protease and urease,
    were significantly positively related with the resistance.'
