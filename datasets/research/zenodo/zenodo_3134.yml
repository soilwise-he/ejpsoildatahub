  title: Organic Matter and Chromium Evolution in Herbage and Soil in a Pinus radiata
    Silvopastoral System in Northwest Spain after Sewage Sludge and Lime Application
  abstract: "This article aims to compare the effects of applying three doses of sewage\
    \ sludge, with\nor without liming, on organic matter, total and available chromium\
    \ (Cr), and their \n oncentrationin plants. Unfertilized (NF) and mineral treatments\
    \ were used as control. Soil\norganic-matter (SOM) modification depended on the\
    \ interaction of liming and sewage\nsludge implementation. Liming, high sludge\
    \ doses, and mineral treatment caused less\nSOM in the second year of study. However,\
    \ after 3 years, SOM was increased by both\nmineral and sludge fertilizers compared\
    \ to NF treatments as result of tree development\nand the reduction of organic-matter\
    \ mineralization into the soil. These findings\ncould have important implications\
    \ for soil carbon storage capacity. Total Cr in soil and\nforage was increased\
    \ by sewage sludge application compared to mineral or NF treatments.\nLiming increased\
    \ Cr availability in the spring of 2000, where sewage sludge was\napplied, and\
    \ reduced Fe availability."
