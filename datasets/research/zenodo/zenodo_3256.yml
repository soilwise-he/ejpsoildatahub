  title: A Simple Spectrofluorimetric Method for the Determination of Cadmium at Ultra-trace
    Levels in some Real, Environmental, Biological, Tobacco, Food, Fertilizer and
    Soil Samples Using 2', 3, 4', 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong> <em>A very simple, ultra-sensitive and highly\
    \ selective non-extractive spectrofluorimetric</em><em> method for the determination\
    \ of cadmium at ultra-trace levels using 2',3,4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone(morin)\
    \ has been developed. Morin reacts in a slightly acidic (0.0005-0.002 </em><em>M\
    \ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) aqueous solution </em><em>with cadmium and to form\
    \ intensely fluorescent chelate, which has high fluorescence intensity </em><em>\
    \ (</em><em>l<sub>ex </sub>=424 nm; </em><em>l<sub>em</sub>=485 nm)</em><em>.The\
    \ reaction is instantaneous and the fluorescent intensely remains stable for the\
    \ period between 5 min and 24 h</em><em>. Linear calibration graphs were obtained\
    \ for 0.01- 600-\u03BCg L<sup>-1 </sup>of Cd, with an R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.99987,\
    \ having</em><em> a detection limit of 1 ng L<sup>-1</sup>; the quantification\
    \ limit of the reaction system was found to be 10 ng </em><em>L<sup>-1</sup> and\
    \ the RSD was 0-3%. The stoichiometric composition of the chelate is 1:2 (Cd:morin).\
    \ A large excess of over 60 captions, anions and complexing agents (like chloride,\
    \ phosphate, azide, tartrate, oxalate, SCN<sup>- </sup>etc.) do not interfere\
    \ in the determination. The developed method was successfully used in the determination\
    \ of cadmium in several Standard Reference Materials (alloys, steels, sediments,human\
    \ hair, bovine liver, freshwater, and rice flour) as well as in some environmental\
    \ waters (potable and polluted), biological samples (human blood, urine and hair),\
    \ tobacco samples, food samples (rice, wheat, cake, tea, cookies and shellfish),vegetables\
    \ samples(radish, carrot, ginger, potato, tomato and cabbage),fertilizer samples,\
    \ soil samples and complex synthetic mixtures. The results of the biological,\
    \ food and vegetable analyses by </em><em>spectrofluorimetric methods were found\
    \ to be in excellent agreement with those obtained by AAS. The method has high\
    \ precision and accuracy (s = \xB10.01 for 0.5\xB5g</em><em>L<sup>-1</sup>).</em>\
