  title: Degree of soil grinding by rotary roller
  abstract: 'High-quality preparation of the soil for sowing various crops is very
    important for obtaining optimal seedlings and creating the best conditions for
    plant development. For this purpose it is necessary to have in the top layer of
    soil not less than 50...60 percent of structural units with the size of particles
    of 0,25 ... 10 millimeters. To reduce the energy consumption of the process and
    improve the quality of tillage based on knowledge of the physical and mechanical
    properties of the soil, it is necessary to use such methods of deformation so
    that cutting resistance is minimal, and working bodies create multidirectional
    deformations due to several methods of soil monolith destruction. Today, tillage
    implements with active working bodies are widely used for surface tillage. The
    most common rotary soil looseners. Therefore, when designing these tools and their
    working bodies should be borne in mind that they must primarily provide high quality
    tillage, the ability to change the mode of cutting the soil in a wide range. The
    analysis of structural and technological schemes of rotary soil looseners and
    the process of their work showed that the greatest influence on the technological
    process of loosening have the following parameters: width, working speed, rotor
    shaft speed, number of working knives, pitch of knives its geometric characteristics.
    It is from these parameters primarily depends on the deformation of the soil and
    the reduction of cutting resistance. If we compare tillage tools for surface tillage,
    the best quality of soil preparation for sowing cereals is provided by active
    working bodies, but they also have certain disadvantages: insufficient earning
    of stubble and crop residues in the soil, high energy consumption, complex design.
    Therefore, the study of structural parameters of the leavening agent and their
    dependence on the physical and mechanical properties of the soil is a topical
    issue today. The aim of our research is to analyze and optimize the design and
    technological parameters of the rotary soil loosener and their impact on the degree
    of grinding of the soil during its surface cultivation for sowing of different
    crops. The study is based on the methods of mathematics and theoretical mechanics
    The result of the research is the optimization of the parameters of the rotary
    ripper and their influence on the degree of soil grinding.'
