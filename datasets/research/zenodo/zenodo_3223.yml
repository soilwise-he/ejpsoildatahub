  title: 'Evaluation of Seismic Performance of Concrete Gravity Dams Under Soil-structure-reservoir
    Interaction Exposed to Vertical Component of Near-field Earthquakes During Impounding
    Case study: Pine Flat Dam'
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Given the current water crisis in the world and the fact that dams are
    superstructures for water conservation in agricultural and domestic uses, the
    seismic performance of Pine Flat Dam is evaluated under the soil-structure-reservoir
    interaction ex-posed to vertical component of near-field earthquakes in this study.
    Hence the dam is modeled in the plane strain space un-der the foundation-structure-fluid
    interaction using Abaqus finite element software in order to consider the effects
    of founda-tion flexibility and hydrodynamic forces. The reservoir is modeled in
    3 full, half-full and empty conditions and the results are assessed and presented
    for each condition. The results of analysis show that when the dam is in use and
    the entire volume of reservoir is filled with water and the conditions of near-field
    earthquakes are predominated, more displacement is applied to the dam, which may
    make it enter the nonlinear region.&lt;/p&gt;'
