  title: EFFECTIVENESS OF SUGARCANE STRAW ASH AND PULVERIZED USED PAPER FOR STABILIZATION
    OF VERTISOLS SOIL
  abstract: In the discipline of civil engineering, the foundation plays a crucial
    role in supporting and containing loads of complete structures. Therefore, a foundation
    needs to be strong enough to increase any structure's useful life. The soil has
    a direct impact on the structure's foundation. Vertisols soil is soil with unstable
    and weak soil that needs to be stabilized to make the soil suitable for construction
    purposes. The study is to determine the effectiveness of the pulverized used paper
    and sugarcane straw ash as stabilizers of vertisols soil in San Isidro, Nueva
    Ecija. Natural soil was classified as A-7-6 of AASTHO classification system and
    CH as group name classified by USCS classification system, indicates that the
    soil is high in clay. The index properties of the natural soil showed that it
    is poor and weak soil that is not applicable for engineering purposes. Liquid
    limit and plasticity index values of 60% and 35%, respectively, suggested that
    the soil is in high plasticity. There is a gradual decrease in the plasticity
    index to a value of 25% at 15% SCSA+PUP as compared to natural vertisols soil
    with 35%, this indicates that the soil is progressively stabilizing. In addition,
    there are increases in the compaction parameters and CBR value of 14.0283 kN/m<sup>3</sup>
    and 5.47 at 100% MDD compared to natural vertisols soil with values of 13.69476
    kN/m<sup>3</sup> and 4.83 at 100% MDD, respectively. But these values fall from
    the requirement suggested of sub-base coarse, however, there are considerable
    changes in the vertisols soil using SCSA and PUP. This research aimed to determine
    the effectiveness of SCSA and PUP in stabilizing the vertisols soil
