  title: The Concept of Soil Mapping With the Use of Aerospace Photos
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In modern photogrammetry, the latest aerial photography equipment,
    photogrammetric and stereophotogrammetric instruments, and computer technology
    are widely used. This significantly reduces the time and improves the quality
    of the products. Aerospace images, as well as the results of their processing,
    have a number of advantages, thanks to which they are used to solve numerous problems.
    In conclusion, it is concluded that the map on the&nbsp;materials of the aerospace
    survey of differences in qualitative and quantitative indicators of land can successfully
    apply them to monitor the cadastral valuation of lands. The resulting information
    is used at the same time in determining the market and the collateral value of
    land rents, tax and other economic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;'
