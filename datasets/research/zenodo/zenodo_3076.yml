  title: 'Previous degradation study of two herbicides to simulate their fate in a
    sandy loam soil: Effect of the temperature and the organic amendments'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;A laboratory study was designed to assess the following: i)\
    \ the degradation kinetics of chlorotoluron and flufenacet at two different temperatures,\
    \ 6\u202F&deg;C and 16\u202F&deg;C, in an unamended agricultural soil and one\
    \ amended with spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and green compost (GC), and ii)\
    \ the formation of the main metabolites of both herbicides with potential risk\
    \ for water pollution over degradation time. The aim was to determine the dependence\
    \ of these herbicide degradations on temperature (Q10 factor) using kinetic parameters,\
    \ which is essential information for the later simulation of herbicide environmental\
    \ fate with FOCUS models. SMS and GC were applied in situ to the natural soil\
    \ as organic amendments at rates of 140 or 85\u202Ft\u202Fresidue\u202Fha&minus;1,\
    \ respectively. Unamended and amended soils were taken from the 0&ndash;10\u202F\
    cm topsoil of experimental plots (three replicates/treatment) located on an agricultural\
    \ farm. Samples of soil\u202F+\u202Fherbicides were incubated at 6\u202F&deg;C\
    \ or 16\u202F&deg;C under laboratory conditions. The degradation curves of chlorotoluron\
    \ and flufenacet were fitted to single first-order and first-order multicompartment\
    \ kinetic models, respectively. The flufenacet degradation, the more hydrophobic\
    \ herbicide, was slower than that of chlorotoluron in all the treatments. The\
    \ application of the organic amendments to soil increased the half-lives (DT50)\
    \ for both herbicides incubated at 6\u202F&deg;C (1.3&ndash;1.9 times) and 16\u202F\
    &deg;C (1.4&ndash;1.9 times) due to their higher sorption and lower bioavailability\
    \ for degradation in amended soils. The herbicides recorded a faster degradation\
    \ at 16\u202F&deg;C than at 6\u202F&deg;C (Q10\u202F=\u202F1.9&ndash;2.8) due\
    \ to the increased microbial biomass and/or activity with temperature. The metabolites\
    \ desmethyl chlorotoluron, flufenacet ESA and flufenacet OA were detected in all\
    \ the soil treatments at both incubation temperatures. The determination of Q10\
    \ factors in amended soils is very valuable for generating accurate input data\
    \ for pesticide fate models such as FOCUS in order to improve the evaluation of\
    \ the leaching of herbicides and their transformation products, which is a relevant\
    \ goal to maintain the sustainability of agricultural systems.&lt;/p&gt;"
