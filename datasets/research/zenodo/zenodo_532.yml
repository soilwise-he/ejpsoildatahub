  title: Faunistic Analysis Of Soil Mites In Coffee Plantation
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract \u2500 </em></strong><em>The soil-litter system\
    \ is the natural habitat for a wide variety of organisms, microorganisms and invertebrates,\
    \ with differences in size and metabolism, which are responsible for numerous\
    \ functions. The soil mesofauna is composed of animals of body diameter between\
    \ 100 \u03BCm and 2 mm, consisting of the groups Araneida, Acari, Collembola,\
    \ Hymenoptera, Diptera, Protura, Diplura, Symphyla, Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta),\
    \ Isoptera, Chilopoda, Diplopoda and Mollusca. These animals, extremely dependent\
    \ on humidity, move in the pores of the soil and at the interface between the\
    \ litter and the soil. The edaphic fauna, besides having a great functional diversity,\
    \ presents a rich diversity of species. As a result, these organisms affect the\
    \ physical, chemical and, consequently, the biological factors of the soil. Therefore,\
    \ the edaphic fauna and its activities are of extreme importance so that the soil\
    \ is fertile and can vigorously support the vegetation found there, being spontaneous\
    \ or cultivated. </em><em>The composition, distribution and density of the edaphic\
    \ acarofauna varies according to the soil depth, mites size, location and the\
    \ season of the year. Edaphic mites are generally found in greater quantities\
    \ in the organic matter layer than in the soil mineral. The subclass Acari is\
    \ divided in seven orders being the Mesostigmata, Trombidiformes, Endeostigmata\
    \ and Sarcoptiformes those that frequently occur in the soil. In the order Sarcoptiformes\
    \ the suborder Oribatida (formerly Cryptostigmata) is one of the more numerous\
    \ groups of soil arthropods, both in number of species and specimens. </em><em>Considering\
    \ the above facts, it was the objective of this work to know the acarofauna of\
    \ the soil in a coffee plantation and rank the taxa in a decreasing way, by the\
    \ use of faunistic analysis. </em><em>The soil samples were taken in coffee plantation\
    \ in the Experimental Station of EPAMIG, in S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o do Para\xEDso,\
    \ MG, Brazil, in two periods, end of dry and end of rainy season of the year 2013,\
    \ and the extraction of edaphic mites of the soil mesofauna was done at the Laboratory\
    \ of Acarology of EPAMIG Sul/EcoCentro, in Lavras, as well as other activities\
    \ related to the study. </em><em>The result show that edaphic mites of the cohort\
    \ Astigmatina and suborder Oribatid are dominant in both periods studied, and\
    \ can be worked to be an indicative of soil quality.</em>"
