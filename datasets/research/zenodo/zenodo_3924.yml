  title: Assessment of phytoremediation potential of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L Walp)
    on used motor oil contaminated soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Phytoremediation has been identified as an effective option
    for the clean-up of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. This study aims to
    assess the potential of &lt;em&gt;Vigna unguiculata&lt;/em&gt; L. Walp (cowpea)
    in the remediation of used motor oilcontaminated soil. The germination and growth
    of cowpea on soil contaminated with 5% (w/w) of used motor oil were monitored
    for 28 days. One of the treatments received 15% (w/w) poultry manure seven days
    after pollution. The result of the physicochemical analysis of the soil and used
    motor oil shows that both have acidic pH values (5.90 for soil and 5.96 for used
    motor oil). Microbial degradation of the used motor oil was monitored by measuring
    the Total Heterotrophic Bacterial Count (THC), Hydrocarbon Utilizing Bacterial
    count (HUB), and gravimetric loss of used motor oil {Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon
    (TPH)} with time. The treatment options supplemented with poultry manure recorded
    higher THC and HUB counts (76.8 &times; 106 cfu/g and 15.0 &times; 106 cfu/g respectively).
    The result of the biodegradation studies shows a significant reduction of the
    concentration of the used motor oil with time. The highest reduction in TPH (83%)
    was observed in the contaminated soil with cowpea plant and poultry manure. It
    was also observed that the cowpea plant performed better in the presence of poultry
    manure, as reflected in the results of the agronomic studies carried out. This
    study has shown that cowpea (&lt;em&gt;Vigna unguiculata&lt;/em&gt;) has great
    prospects as a tool for the clean- up of used oil-contaminated soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
