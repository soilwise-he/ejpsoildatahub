  title: IMPORTANCE OF SOIL MOISTURE IN AGRICULTURE
  abstract: <em>The article provides basic information about some methods of physical
    research, helping the students to study the laws of physics </em><em>in-depth</em><em>,
    </em><em>and carry</em><em> out laboratory work of ecological content. In addition,
    performing laboratory work plays an important role in students' polytechnic education
    and </em><em>labor</em><em> education.</em> <em>The correct organization and conduct
    of laboratory work in the general secondary education school in an ecological
    context is a reason for creating a creative situation and interest in physics
    classes to a large extent.</em> <em>It is necessary to organize laboratory work
    in an ecological context in such a way that they can independently analyze the
    results obtained during the educational experiment and find the causes of the
    incident. Carrying out laboratory work in the ecological content of physics provides
    an opportunity to deepen the knowledge of students and introduce them to the basis
    of various laws in nature. Environmental problems have arisen due to the depletion
    of natural resources and the problems of environmental pollution. imparting knowledge
    is one of the important problems of physics. One of the important tasks facing
    schools at the moment is to connect physics education with everyday life. Conducted
    scientific and research works, work experiences of advanced and creative physics
    teachers show that in the process of teaching physics, materials related to ecology
    are appropriate. to be able to use it, to better understand the laws of physics,
    to educate them in the spirit of respect for the nature of the country where they
    live, as well as to help them solve the problems of career guidance. At present,
    when private ownership of farms and private ownership is implemented in the management
    of agriculture in our country, one of the main factors that cause a positive change
    in the environment is the ability of students to apply theoretical knowledge acquired
    from each educational subject, especially physics. Therefore, an example of laboratory
    work with ecological content is shown so that every schoolchild can relate physics
    to ecology and apply it to agricultural production.</em>
