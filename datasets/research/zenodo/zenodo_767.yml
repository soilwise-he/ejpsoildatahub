  title: Effect Of Soil Management Practices On Evaporanspiration Of Sorghum Plot
  abstract: "The trial was conducted to quantify soil water loss under sorghum at\
    \ Samaru  (11<sup>o</sup> 11\u2019N, 7<sup>o</sup> 36\u2019E, 686m above mean\
    \ sea level) on the Northern Guinea Savanna Ecological Zone of Nigeria during\
    \ 2005/06 rainy seasons.  The treatments, which consisted of two soil management\
    \ practices, mulched soil and bared soil, were replicated four times in a randomized\
    \ complete block design.  Microlysimeters were installed at 8 weeks after sowing\
    \ (WAS) for daily reading of potential evapotranspiration . Data were analyzed\
    \ using the two way analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation analysis. Results\
    \ from the two seasons indicated that there was a significant positive correlation\
    \ between the yield, yield components and potential evapotranspiration under mulched\
    \ soil. Under bare soil, water loss was not significantly correlated with the\
    \ yield and yield components."
