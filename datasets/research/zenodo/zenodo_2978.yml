  title: AN INVESTIGATION ON THE SOIL AND PEAT HUMIC ACIDS. PART II. OXIDATION WITH
    HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, HOT ALKALI AND CHLORINE DIOXIDE SOLUTION.
  abstract: A humic acid from peat and another from an Assam tea soil were oxidised
    by various strengths of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>both as pure acid and as the
    Ca salt. They were also subjected to a method of degradation similar to that used
    by Freudenberg in connection with lignin. Products of the same nature were isolated.
    The acids were also<em> </em>oxidised by ClO<sub>2</sub> and oxalic and butyric
    acids detected in the products.
