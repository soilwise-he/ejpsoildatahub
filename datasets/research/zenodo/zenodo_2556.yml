  title: Comparative Cost Advantages of Interlocking Stabilized Soil Block and Sandcrete
    Block for Building Construction in South-West Nigeria
  abstract: "Interlocking stabilized soil blocks (ISSBS) is undoubtedly one of the\
    \ contemporary building materials used for building construction works in developing\
    \ countries. The ISSBs is gaining fast recognition as frontline alternative to\
    \ Sandcrete blocks for affordable housing development in Nigeria. However, despite\
    \ the positive reports of United Nations upholding ISSB as an affordable building\
    \ material for low cost housing in developing African nations, the patronage of\
    \ ISSBs is low-slung when compared to the conventional Sandcrete blocks (SBs).\
    \ This study explored the comparative cost advantages of Interlocking stabilized\
    \ soil blocks and Sandcrete blocks for building construction in Southwestern Nigeria\
    \ with the view of promoting it\u2019s usage for affordable housing development.\
    \ The objectives were; to identify the most common types of Interlocking stabilised\
    \ soil blocks and Sandcrete blocks used for building construction works in southwestern\
    \ Nigeria; to analyze the cost of ISSBS for building walling system; to compare\
    \ the cost of building walling systems with Interlocking stabilized soil blocks\
    \ and Sandcrete blocks in Southwestern Nigeria. Existing literature on the use\
    \ of Interlocking stabilised soil blocks (ISSBs) were reviewed. Using qualitative\
    \ research approaches where Interviews and documentaries was phenomenal; the cost\
    \ comparativeness of ISSBs and SBs in this study was analyzed using Empirical\
    \ data\u2019s obtained from local construction markets and ISSBs promoters. Findings\
    \ revealed the cost of ISSBs is relatively cheaper than Sandcrete blocks due to\
    \ the mortar-less walling systems; the eradication of wall rendering and drastic\
    \ reduction in the use of cement, concrete, reinforcement and industrial materials.\
    \ The study recommended that more agencies should be established. Promoters of\
    \ ISSBs should invests heavily on awareness and sensitization of the populace\
    \ on the significance of adoption ISSBs for building construction"
