  title: Determination of Soil Loss by Erosion in Different Land Covers Categories
    and Slope Classes in Bovilla Watershed, Tirana, Albania
  abstract: As a sediment production mechanism, soil erosion is the main environmental
    threat to the Bovilla watershed, including the decline of water quality of the
    Bovilla reservoir that provides drinking water to Tirana city (the capital of
    Albania). Therefore, an experiment with 25 erosion plots for soil erosion monitoring
    has been set up since June 2017. The aim was to determine the soil loss on plot
    and watershed scale in Bovilla watershed (Tirana region) for implementation of
    soil and water protection measures or payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs.
    The results of erosion monitoring for the period June 2017 - May 2018 showed that
    the highest values of surface runoff were noted in bare land of 38829.91 liters
    on slope of 74% and the lowest values in forest land of 12840.6 liters on slope
    of 64% while the highest values of soil loss were found in bare land of 595.15
    t/ha on slope of 62% and lowest values in forest land of 18.99 t/ha on slope of
    64%. These values are much higher than the average rate of soil loss in the European
    Union (2.46 ton/ha/year). In the same sloping class, the soil loss was reduced
    from orchard or bare land to the forest land, and in the same category of land
    use, the soil loss increased with increasing land slope. It is necessary to conduct
    chemical analyses of sediments to determine the amount of chemical elements leached
    out of the soil and end up in the reservoir of Bovilla. It is concluded that PES
    programs should be implemented for rehabilitation of sub-watersheds Ranxe, Vilez
    and Zall-Bastar of the Bovilla watershed with valuable conservation practices.
