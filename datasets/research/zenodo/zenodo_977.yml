  title: Analysis of soil samples for its physicochemical parameters from Sangamner
    city
  abstract: "A physicochemical study of soil is based on various parameters like soil\
    \ pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), available nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn). Five\
    \ representative samples were obtained and analyzed for its alkalinity content,\
    \ pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, sodium, potassium. A five soil\
    \ samples were collected at a depth of 0\u201320 cm and analyzed for soils were\
    \ neutral to slightly alkaline. The value of soil pH found to be 7.60 to 8.81,\
    \ conductivity was ranging from 0.50 to 0.73 dSm<sup>\u22121</sup>, organic carbon\
    \ was found to be 0.52 to 0.72%, range of sodium was 0.52 to 0.97meq% and potassium\
    \ 125.31 to 630.15 kg/ha. Among the nutrients, available Nitrogen was found to\
    \ be 140.01 to 252.68 kg/ha, Phosphorous was ranging from 15.11 to 54.13 kg/ha.\
    \ This information will help the farmers to know amount of fertilizers to be added\
    \ in soil to make production."
