  title: Experimental Study on Clay Soil Characteristics By Using Egg Shell Powder
  abstract: "<em>One of the most crucial components used in a variety of construction\
    \ projects, such as earthen dams and canals, is soil. It is important to use a\
    \ variety of techniques to increase soil stability because soil may already have\
    \ all the resistance qualities required for a project. Eggshell powder is added\
    \ to the geotechnical properties in the laboratory tests to improve the behaviour\
    \ of the engineering properties as a result of this project's investigation. The\
    \ combination of egg shell powder improves soil properties more effectively than\
    \ using just regular soil. </em><em>Egg Shell Powder </em><em>is</em><em> used\
    \ with the clay soil to increase the stability of the soil and is determined by\
    \ varying the proportions from </em><em>15%, 20%, 25%. The properties are studied\
    \ by conducting the tests namely Atterberg\u2019s limit test, Standard proctor\
    \ test, unconfined compressive strength test.</em>"
