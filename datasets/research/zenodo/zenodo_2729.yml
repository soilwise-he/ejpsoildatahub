  title: Effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on sustainability of soil fertility
    and grain yield in a rice-wheat system
  abstract: This article 'Effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on sustainability
    of soil fertility and grain yield in a rice-wheat system' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development
    of improved technology for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism
    to help scientists keep each other informed of current rice research findings.
    The concise scientific notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate
    with one another to obtain details on the research reported.
