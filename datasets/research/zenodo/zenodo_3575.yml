  title: Bearing Capacity of Soft Marine Soil Stabilization with Cockel Shell Powder
    CSP
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The quality of the subgrade is depending on the geotechnical
    properties, strength and the stabilization technique adopted for problematic soil
    in order to increase the bearing value. In Malaysia, soft soil is a challenging
    due to very low strength value and low California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value as
    well. The soil stabilization process is conducted to increase bearing capacity
    of marine soil. An experimental works cover from identification of basic soil
    properties by index test, compaction test and CBR test. Though, the marine soils
    have to be treated and stabilized with available methods like using natural materials
    or additive agents. In this study, geotechnical characteristics of marine soil
    stabilized with CSP content were determined. The unsoaked treated marine soil
    stabilized with CSP was investigated. Four different compounds of the soil with
    2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% of CSP were mixed and added to determine the unsoaked CBR
    of the stabilized soil compounds. The results show the inclusion of CSP reduced
    the plasticity of the soil and highest dry density was decreased with an increase
    in the optimum water content. Moreover, by increasing the content of CSP the highest
    CBR value at 2.5 and 5.0 mm penetrations were achieved. The increasing percentage
    volume of water usage indicates the decreasing value of CBR. The results indicated
    that CSP contents have potential as a natural stabilizer for applications such
    as road sub-base material in road construction. The road sub-base will gain great
    strength with addition of CSP on marine soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
