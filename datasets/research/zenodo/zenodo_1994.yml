  title: TREES SPECIES DIVERSITY AND SOIL PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES IN UKPON FOREST
    RESERVE, CROSS RIVER STATE, NIGERIA
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> In Okpon river forest reserve, soil nutrients\
    \ play an important role in the formation of plant communities. In this study,\
    \ trees species diversity and soil physiochemical properties in Ukpon river forest\
    \ reserve cross River State, Nigeria was assessed using Systematic line transects\
    \ and purposive sampling techniques for plots demarcation and data collection.\
    \ Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as tables, frequencies\
    \ and diversity indices were analyzed using \u2018R\u2019 soft wear. 65 tree species\
    \ in 32 families and 10 genera were identified. Meliaceae, (6) Caesalpiniceae\
    \ and Moraceae (5) families each were the most abundant families individuals population.\
    \ ). The highest relative frequency (2.256%) and (2.241%) were recorded in <em>Melicia\
    \ excelsa</em>. Relative dominance (4.970%) was highest in <em>Bianella toxisperma</em>.\
    \ IVI recorded the highest value (4.970%) in <em>Melicia excelsa</em> . The highest\
    \ dbh and tree height were (80.5cm) and (68.3m). Shannon wiener index was (5.058),\
    \ Margelef index ( 36. 097) and species richness (68). However, it is necessary\
    \ to understand the phenology of the forest reserve, to study whether seeds or\
    \ fruits produced are adequate, physiological conditions to germinate and growth\
    \ into wildlings for regeneration purpose. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Trees, Species,\
