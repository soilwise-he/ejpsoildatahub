  title: Remediation Of Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Contaminated Soil Slurry By Fenton Oxidation
  abstract: "Theobjective of this study was to evaluate the optimal\ntreatment condition\
    \ of Fenton oxidation process to removal\ncontaminant in soil slurry contaminated\
    \ by petroleum hydrocarbons.\nThis research studied somefactors that affect the\
    \ removal efficiency\nof petroleum hydrocarbons in soil slurry including molar\
    \ ratio of\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to ferrous ion(Fe2+), pH condition and\n\
    reaction time.The resultsdemonstrated that the optimum condition\nwas that the\
    \ molar ratio of H2O2:Fe3+ was 200:1,the pHwas 4.0and\nthe rate of reaction was\
    \ increasing rapidly from starting point to 7th\nhour and destruction kinetic\
    \ rate (k) was 0.24 h-1. Approximately\n96% of petroleum hydrocarbon was observed(initialtotal\
    \ petroleum\nhydrocarbon (TPH) concentration = 70\xB17gkg-1)"
