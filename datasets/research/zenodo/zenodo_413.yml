  title: Comparative analysis of linear dynamic responses and undamped systems of
    soil-pile-footing interaction for various soil media
  abstract: It is seen from recent earthquakes that in case of fixed-base foundation
    system, damped systems have proved to be longing the lifespan of the structure
    by lengthening the lateral fundamental period that leads to higher damping in
    comparison to the assumptions of a fixed-base system. In this study, to better
    understand the phenomenon involved in soil-pile interaction a finite element simulation
    model is developed in Abaqus FEA software. The numerical model made for transient
    analysis follows Rayleigh's Damping Coefficient model for material damping. In
    this paper, a rational analysis of Dynamic Response of a Short-Bored Pile is made
    subject to axial load by the Finite Element Method. The analysis is performed
    using finite element Abaqus CAE software. The Soil media is developed for sand
    soil and clay soil with pile material as Mild Steel and RCC, and analysis is made
    for the combination of each material group with the incremental axial load. The
    same FE model is studied for damped material used in piles which results in a
    drastic change in displacement pattern.
