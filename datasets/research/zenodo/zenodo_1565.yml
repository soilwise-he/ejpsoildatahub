  title: Multivariate Interaction Analysis of Winter Wheat Grown in Environment of
    Limited Soil Conditions
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The less productive soils present one of the major problems in wheat
    production. Because of unfavorable conditions, halomorphic soils could be intensively
    utilized using ameliorative measures and by selecting suitable stress tolerant
    wheat genotypes. This study examined the responses of ten winter wheat cultivars
    on stressful conditions of halomorphic soil, solonetz type in Banat, Serbia. The
    wheat genotypes were grown in field trails of control and treatments with two
    soil amelioration levels using phosphor gypsum, in amounts of 25 and 50 tha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    Across two vegetation seasons, phenotypic variability and genotype by environment
    interaction (GEI) for yield traits of wheat were studied. The additive main effects
    and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) models were used to study the GEI. AMMI
    analyses revealed significant genotype and environmental effects, as well as GEI
    effect. Analysis of GEI using the IPCA (Interaction Principal Components) analysis
    showed a statistical significance of the first two main components, IPCA1 and
    IPCA2 for yield, which jointly explained 70% of GEI variation. First source of
    variation IPCA1 explained 41.15% of the GEI for the grain weight per plant and
    78.54% for the harvest index. The results revealed that wheat genotypes responded
    differently to stressful conditions and ameliorative measures.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
