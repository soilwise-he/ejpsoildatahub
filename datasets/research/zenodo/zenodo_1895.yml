  title: ANALYSIS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF GRASS SENSITIVE SOIL ON THE SUITABILITY
    OF CORN VARIETIES
  abstract: <em>This article aims to study the environmental impact of new and promising
    varieties of corn on the salinity of alluvial soils, and compares the examples
    of scientists' work. In addition, due to saline soil conditions, it is important
    to identify methods that help not only to maintain soil fertility, but also to
    increase the yield and quality of the main crops.</em>
