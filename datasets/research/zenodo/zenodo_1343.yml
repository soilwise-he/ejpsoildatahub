  title: Studies on Chelation of Alcohol Soluble Soil Organic Matter Fraction with
    Metals
  abstract: "Department of Applied Chemistry, Calcutta University <em>Received</em>\
    \ 2 <em>July</em> 1970; <em>revised M SS received </em>13 <em>April </em>1971\
    \ Studies were conducted to investigate the interactions between certain bivalent\
    \ and trivalent metallic cations and alcohol soluble hymatomelanic acid (Hy.A.)\
    \ fraction of soil humic acid isolated from alluvial soil of West Bengal by electrometric\
    \ titrations and absorption spectroscopy. Discontinuous conductometric titrations\
    \ showed the formation of more than one complex. Potentiometric titrations io\
    \ presence of metallic cations indicated the formation of Hy.A-metal complexes.\
    \ The order of the magnitude of <em>p</em>H drop of Hy.A. on addition of metallic\
    \ cations was found to be Ni<sup>2+</sup>&lt; Zn<sup>2+</sup> &lt; Cu<sup>2+</sup>\
    \ and Fe<sup>2+</sup> &lt; Fe<sup>3+</sup> &lt;Al<sup>3+</sup>. Absorption spectroscopy\
    \ showed the formation of complexes of different molal com\xB7 positions at different\
    \ <em>p</em>H values,"
