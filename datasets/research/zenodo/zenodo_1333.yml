  title: Study of Saline Water Effect on Geotechnical Properties of High Plastic Soil
  abstract: In this project work, we observed how the<br> fine-grained soil properties
    affect by saline water. In the<br> laboratory, several tests were conducted. The
    test was<br> conducted with and without Sodium Chloride<br> concentration. By
    adding Sodium chloride concentration<br> to the soil, the liquid and plastic limit
    decreases with<br> increases its concentration. As we know for the<br> classification
    of soil, the liquid limit was an important<br> factor. So in this project work,
    we study how salinity<br> affects liquid limit and how it is carried out for future<br>
    work purposes. Also, the plastic limit is affected by saline<br> water, so plasticity
    index varies. Here we have discussed<br> the result and the relative graphs such
    as Liquid limit vs<br> NaCl concentration on High plastic soil, Plastic limit
    vs<br> NaCl concentration on High plastic soil, OMC vs NaCl<br> concentration
    on High plastic soil, MDD vs NaCl<br> concentration on High plastic soil and also
    compared the<br> results of distilled water.
