  title: Degradation Propensity Of Welded Mild Steel In Coastal Soil Of University
    Of Lagos
  abstract: 'Study on corrosion propensity of welded mild steel- bar in soil media
    around the coastal area of University of Lagos has been carried out using gravimetric
    method. Six (6) samples each for welded and unwelded mild steels were cut, their
    initial weights were recorded and buried in two selected soil. The weight losses
    of these coupons were measured at regular intervals for a period of six months
    (180 days).


    The corrosiveness of the soil media varied widely depending on the potency level
    of its constituents. The results revealed that soil in the studied area have marked
    variations in composition and contents. Soil medium with a lower pH and higher
    chloride ion concentration aggressively attacked the coupons with the welded steel
    coupon corroding faster than unwelded one. The medium resistivity to the flow
    of current is another strong factor affecting corrosion rate.'
