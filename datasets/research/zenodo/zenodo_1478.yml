  title: Comparative Study of Physicochemical properties of Soil, Aheri, Maharashtra
    &amp; Effect of Vermicompost Fertilizer
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Farmers are using chemical fertilizer for farming to extend
    the yield of crops. Chemical fertilizer reduces soils fertility and it also contaminate
    ground water table..Recycling of biowaste is necessary to reduces waste .It makes
    our campus clean likewise as contribute in sustainable development. This waste
    are often converted into useful fertilizer as a Vermicompost.Vermicompost will
    enrich the soil and its fertility. Vermicompost also results in decrease the environmental
    problems. Vermicompost could be a vital biofertilizer and Vermicompost is enriched
    with all beneficial soil bacteria and also contains many of the essential plant
    nutrients like N, P, K and micronutrients.(1) Vermicomposting is that the process
    of production of compost by breeding earthworms, leading to homogeneous and stabilized
    humus used as manure and significantly increased the quantity of N, P, K and C
    concentration in vermicompost. The aim of this paper to recycle biowaste and study
    various physicochemical property of soil and impact of vermicompost fertilizer
    on soils property of Aheri, Nagpur . The observed values of various physicochemical
    parameter in all soil samples, after addition of vemicompost is fairly good.&lt;/p&gt;'
