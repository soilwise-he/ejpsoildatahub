  title: Role of Thermoplastic Granulus for the Improvement of Strength of Clay Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil stabilization is any process which improves the physical
    properties of soil, such as increasing shear strength, bearing capacity etc. which
    can be done by use of controlled compaction or addition of suitable admixtures
    like cement, lime and waste materials like fly ash, phosphogypsum etc. The cost
    of introducing these additives has also increased in recent years which opened
    the door widely for the development of other kinds of soil additives such as plastics,
    bamboo etc. This new technique of soil stabilization can be effectively used to
    meet the challenges of society, to reduce the quantities of waste, producing useful
    material from non useful waste materials. Using of plastic wastes such as plastic
    bags, PVC powder from industry and construction and demolition waste is increasing
    day by day leading to various environmental concerns. Therefore the disposal of
    the plastic wastes without causing any ecological hazards has become a real challenge.
    Thus using PVC as a soil stabilizer is an economical utilization since there is
    scarcity of good quality soil for embankments. This paper describes an experimental
    study on mixing PVC waste powder with clayey soil at different mixing ratios 0,
    0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 by weight respectively. For the clay Soil, Shear Strength
    parameter and Cohesion Value are obtained by conducting Unconfined Compressive
    Strength UCC test and Maximum Dry Density is found by Standard Proctor Test. V.
