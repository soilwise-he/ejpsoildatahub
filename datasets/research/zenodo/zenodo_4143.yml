  title: Assemblage Of Nest Soil Bacteria And Evaluate The Antibacterial Activity
    Of Carpenter Ant (Camponotus Compressus) Mandibular Extracts Against Selective
    Gram Staining Bacteria
  abstract: "The present study was under taken to explore the assemblage of ant nest\
    \ soil microbes and potential of mandibular gland extraction of carpenter ant\
    \ Camponotus compressus. The microbial assemblages in nest soil from different\
    \ habitats like Grasslands, Shola forest, Wattle plantation, Pine and Tea plantations\
    \ were investigated. Among the isolated microbes from the nest soil bacteria,\
    \ Staphylococcus aeureus was robust in three sites of the study area. Disc diffusion\
    \ method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mandibular gland extraction\
    \ against two robust microbial strains like S. aeureus and Escherichia coli. The\
    \ result revealed that the maximum zone of inhibition was observed against the\
    \ S. aeureus in both 10 \u03BCl and 20 \u03BCl of the mandibular sample and the\
    \ minimum in gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli. The presences of mandibular\
    \ gland proved have good capability more than commercially available antimicrobial\
    \ products to kill or inhibit the growth of microbes inside the nests."
