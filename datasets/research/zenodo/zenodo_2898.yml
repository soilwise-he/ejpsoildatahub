  title: NEW ASPECTS OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND CONSERVATION IN THE SOIL. PART III INFLUENCE
    OF LIGHT ON BACTERIAL NUMBERS AND NITROGEN FIXATION.
  abstract: "Nitrogen fixation is always greater in the soils exposed to sunlight\
    \ than in those kept in dark or covered, while the numbers of azotobacter, total\
    \ bacteria and fungi are less in the former than in the latter. The optimum temperature\
    \ for azotobacter is 35\xB0 in tropical soils as against 25\xB0 (26--30\xB0) in\
    \ temperate climates. The observed greater nitrogen fixation in the exposed soils\
    \ is not at all due to the increase of temperature but is caused by sunlight.\
    \ On the addition of cellulosic substances, the available nitrogen decreases.\
    \ Organic manures like co\" dung, hay. molasses etc. are beneficial because they\
    \ fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil."
