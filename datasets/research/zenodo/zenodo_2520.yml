  title: Acidification and alkalinization pretreatments of biowastes and their effect
    on P solubility and dynamics when placed in soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;Sustainability concerns as well as recent increases in
    fertilizer prices exacerbates the need to optimise the use of biowastes as fertilizers.
    For this reason, we investigated how different pretreatments affect the P dynamics
    when biofertilizers are placed in the soil. Methods: Sewage sludge (SS), sewage
    sludge ash (SS-ash), meat and bone meal (MBM), and the solid fraction of biogas
    digestate (BGF) were pretreated with H2SO4, NaOH, and Ca(OH)2 and incubated for
    2 and 12 days, respectively, in a one-dimensional reaction system for detailed
    studies of the interactions in the biomaterial-soil interface and the soil adjacent
    to the placement zone. Results: Our results showed that acidification and treatment
    with NaOH increased the P solubility of the biomaterials. The P loss from the
    biomaterial layer to the soil was correlated with water-extractable P in the biomaterials
    (0.659) and water-extractable P in the soil (0.809). Acidification significantly
    increased the total amount of P depleted from the biomaterial to the soil whereas
    NaOH pre-treatment did not. However, for NaOH- treated SS and SS-ash, the apparent
    recoveries were significantly higher compared to the acidification due to a decrease
    in soil P sorption capacity as the soil pH increased due to residual alkalinity
    in the biomaterials. Conclusions: Acidification showed promising results by increasing
    the P solubility of all the biomaterials, and the alkalinization of SS and SS-ash
    with NaOH by increasing the apparent recovery in the soil. However, further studies
    are needed to assess the effects of these treatments on plant growth and P uptake.
