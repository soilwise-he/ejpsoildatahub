  title: Poultry Manure Application And Fallow Improves Peanut Production In A Sandy
    Soil Under Continuous Cultivation
  abstract: <em>To meet our food security demands, Papua New Guinea (PNG) needs to
    improve smallholder subsistence agriculture by promoting the production of cash
    crops that mature early and have a high market value. Peanut is a typical example
    of a cash crop which potentially has a high market value, but pod yields are low
    due to declinein soil quality. A field experiment was conducted under 4 different
    land use systems (LUS) to evaluate the effects of continuous peanut cultivation
    on peanut pod yield and on selected soil properties. Peanut pod yield declined
    significantly under the continuous peanut and peanut/corn rotation systems; while
    the poultry manure and land fallow systems significantly increased pod yield.
    Over the 3 cropping seasons, significant changes in organic carbon; extractable
    potassium and CEC in all cropping systems occurred, while changes in total N was
    significant in the peanut/corn rotation and poultry manure cropping systems only.
    No significant changes in bulk density; field capacity; electrical conductivity;
    soil pH and available phosphorus were observed in all the 4 LUS over the 3 cropping
    seasons. We suggest that adequate fallow periods of more than 1 year and poultry
    manures are applied to enhance soil quality and improve peanut productivity and/or
    sustain peanut production in marginal lands under continuous cultivation.</em>
