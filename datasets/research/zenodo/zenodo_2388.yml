  title: TDR pressure cell for monitoring water content retention and bulk electrical
    conductivity curves in undisturbed soil samples
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The water retention curve (&theta;(&psi;)), which defines the
    relationship between soil volumetric water content (&theta;) and matric potential
    (&psi;), is of paramount importance in characterizing the hydraulic behaviour
    of soils. However, few methods are so far available for estimating &theta;(&psi;)
    in undisturbed soil samples. We present a new design of TDR-pressure cell (TDR-Cell)
    for estimating &theta;(&psi;) in undisturbed soil samples. The TDR-Cell consists
    of a 50-mm-long and 50-mm internal diameter stainless steel cylinder (which constitutes
    the outer frame of a coaxial line) attached to a porous ceramic disc and closed
    at the ends with two aluminium lids. A 49-mm-long and 3-mm-diameter stainless
    steel rod, which runs longitudinally through the centre of the cylinder, constitutes
    the inner rod of a coaxial TDR probe. The TDR-Cell was used to determine the &theta;(&psi;)
    curves of a packed sand and seven undisturbed soil samples from three profiles
    of agricultural soils. These &theta;(&psi;) curves were subsequently compared
    to those obtained from the corresponding 2-mm sieved soils using the pressure
    plate method. Measurements of bulk electrical conductivity, &sigma;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;,
    as a function of the water content, &sigma;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(&theta;),
    of the undisturbed soil samples were also performed. An excellent correlation
    (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0&middot;988) was found between
    the &theta; values measured by TDR on the different undisturbed soils and the
    corresponding &theta; obtained from the soil gravimetric water content. A typical
    bimodal &theta;(&psi;) function was found for most of the undisturbed soil samples.
    Comparison between the &theta;(&psi;) curves measured with the TDR-Cell and those
    obtained from the 2-mm sieved soils showed that the pressure plate method overestimates
    &theta; at low &psi; values. The &sigma;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(&theta;) relationship
    was well described by a simple power expression (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
    &gt; 0&middot;95), in which the power factor, defined as tortuosity, ranged between
    1&middot;18 and 3&middot;75.&lt;/p&gt;'
