  title: EFFECTS OF SOYBEAN PLANTING METHODS AND INTER-ROW CULTIVATION ON CHANGES
    IN NITRATE NITROGEN, MOBILE PHOSPHORUS AND EXCHANGEABLE POTASSIUM ELEMENTS IN
    THE SOIL
  abstract: As a repeated crop in the scientific work, in the conditions of the typical
    gray soils of the Okkorgon district of the Tashkent region, soybean varieties
    "Nafis" and "Selekta-201" were irrigated to a depth between the rows in the schemes
    of 60x8x2 and 70x8x2. As a result, in the 60x8x2 planting scheme, it was recommended
    to deeply cultivate soybean varieties "Nafis" and "Selekta-201" 16-18 cm, in the
    70x8x2 planting scheme, 18-20 cm between the rows.
