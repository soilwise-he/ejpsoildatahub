  title: Land Suitability Analysis as a Tool for Evaluating Soil-Improving Cropping
    Systems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agricultural land use planning is based on the capacity of the
    soil to support different types&lt;br&gt;

    of crops and is a prerequisite for better use of cultivated land. Land Suitability
    Analysis (LSA) is used&lt;br&gt;

    to measure the level of suitability of growing a specific crop in the area and
    can also be used to evaluate&lt;br&gt;

    future scenarios as a means for sustainable agriculture. LSA was employed to calculate
    current land&lt;br&gt;

    suitability, as well as four scenarios of Soil-Improving Cropping Systems (SICS):
    (a) Conservation&lt;br&gt;

    Tillage (CT), (b) Cover Crop (CC), (c) Crop Residue Management (CRM), and (d)
    Manure Application&lt;br&gt;

    (MA). The scenarios of SICS were derived by increasing soil organic matter and
    cation exchange&lt;br&gt;

    capacity values depending on the SICS hypothetically applied for a period of 100
    years in the future.&lt;br&gt;

    LSA was evaluated for maize in three sites: (a) Flanders (BE), (b) Somogy (HU),
    and (c) Hengshui&lt;br&gt;

    (CH). LSA was performed using the Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System (ALUES)
    considering&lt;br&gt;

    soil and climatic and topographic parameters. Weighing factors of input parameters
    were assigned&lt;br&gt;

    using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that in Flanders,
    the highly suitable&lt;br&gt;

    (S2) class covered 3.3% of the total area, and the best scenario for improving
    current LS was CRM,&lt;br&gt;

    in which S2 expanded to 9.1%. In Somogy, the S2 class covered 18.3% of the total
    area, and the&lt;br&gt;

    best scenarios for improving current land suitability were CT and CC, in both
    of which the S2 class&lt;br&gt;

    expanded to 70.5% of the total area. In Hengshui, the S2 class covered 64.7% of
    the total area, and&lt;br&gt;

    all SICS scenarios performed extremely well, converting almost all moderately
    suitable (S3) areas&lt;br&gt;

    to S2. The main limiting factor that was recognized from a limiting factor analysis
    in all cases was&lt;br&gt;

    the climatic conditions. This work proves that LSA can evaluate scenarios of management
    practices&lt;br&gt;

    and recognize limiting factors. The proposed methodology is a novel approach that
    can provide land&lt;br&gt;

    suitability maps to efficiently evaluate SICS scenarios by projecting soil characteristics
    and LSA in the&lt;br&gt;

    future, thus facilitating management decisions of regional policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;'
