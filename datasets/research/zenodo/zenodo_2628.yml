  title: The Results of Experiments the Width of the Soil Deeper Like Crushing Angle
    and Its Impact on Studying Performance
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;This article presents the results of experiments on the improvement of
    the plow, equipped with compacted soil plows in the main tillage, in particular,
    the loosening of the subsoil with plowing, and the effect of the crushing angle
    of the soil compactor on its performance.&lt;/p&gt;'
