  title: Productivity and Soil Properties under System of Rice Intensification in
    Rice-Rice Cropping System
  abstract: <em>A field experiment was conducted at Agriculture Instructional cum
    Research Farm, IGKV Raipur during kharif and Rabi seasons three consecutive years
    of 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 to study the effect of nutrient management practices
    on productivity of rice and soil chemical properties under system of rice intensification
    in rice-rice cropping system. The experiment was laid out in randomized block
    design with four replications. The treatments were- T1-100%RFD + 10t FYM/ha, T2-100%RFD
    + 5t FYM/ha +Green Manuring +Microbes, T3 -75%RFD+ Treatment with neem product
    + 10t FYM/ha, T4 -75%RFD + Treatment with neem product + 5t FYM/ha+ Green Manuring
    + Microbes T5 -STBR + 10t FYM/ha, T6 -STBR + 5t FYM/ha + Green Manuring + Microbes,
    T7 -100% RFD, T8 -100% Organic (N equivalent), T9- control and T10- Normal transplanting
    with RFD. Results indicated that application of fertilizers based on STBR along
    with 5tFYM+5t Green manure+Microbes produced the maximum grain yield of rice,
    which was however at par with application of fertilizers based on STBR along with
    10 t FYM/ha. STBR based fertilizer application recorded 8.62-10.20% and 8.64-11.29%
    higher grain yield during Kharif and rabi season, respectively, compared to application
    of recommended fertilizer dose. Application of fertilizers based on STBR along
    with 5tFYM+5t Green manure+ Microbes (PSB and Azospirillum) registered 50.58 and
    50.55% % increase in grain yield compared to application of nutrients through
    organic sources only during Kharif and rabi season, respectively. There was no
    significant difference in soil pH due to different nutrient management during
    all the three years of study. Moreover, after three seasons of experimentation
    soil has increased carbon, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus but available
    potassium decreased slightly. The raise in soil organic carbon content, available
    nitrogen, and available phosphorus were to the tune of 0.10 to 0.12%, 35.1 to
    58.9 kg/ha and 5.82 to 6.90 kg/ha, respectively whereas decrease in soil available
    potassium was to the tune of 24.3 to 38.5 kg/ha.</em>
