  title: Soil Mass Loss Reduction during Rainfalls by Reinforcing the Slopes with
    the Surficial Confinement
  abstract: "Soil confinement systems serve as effective solutions to any erosion\
    \ control project. Various confinements systems, namely triangular, circular and\
    \ rectangular with the size of 50, 100, and 150 mm, and with a depth of 10 mm,\
    \ were embedded in soil samples at slope angle of 60\xB0. The observed soil mass\
    \ losses for the confined soil systems were much smaller than those from unconfined\
    \ system. As a result, the size of confinement and rainfall intensity have a direct\
    \ effect on the soil mass loss. The triangular and rectangular confinement systems\
    \ showed the lowest and highest soil loss masses, respectively. The slopes also\
    \ failed much faster in the unconfined system than in the confined slope."
