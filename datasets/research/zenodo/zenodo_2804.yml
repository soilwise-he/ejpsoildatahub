  title: The effects of multiple layers feed-forward neural network transfer function
    in digital based Ethiopian soil classification and moisture prediction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the area of machine learning performance analysis is the
    major task in order to get a better performance both in training and testing model.
    In addition, performance analysis of machine learning techniques helps to identify
    how the machine is performing on the given input and also to find any improvements
    needed to make on the learning model. Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) has different
    area of applications, but the epoch convergences of the network differs from the
    usage of transfer function. In this study, to build the model for classification
    and moisture prediction of soil, rectified linear units (ReLU), Sigmoid, hyperbolic
    tangent (Tanh) and Gaussian transfer function of feed-forward neural network had
    been analyzed to identify an appropriate transfer function. Color, texture, shape
    and brisk local feature descriptor are used as a feature vector of FFNN in the
    input layer and 4 hidden layers were considered in this study. In each hidden
    layer 26 neurons are used. From the experiment, Gaussian transfer function outperforms
    than ReLU, sigmoid and tanh transfer function. But the convergence rate of Gaussian
    transfer function took more epoch than ReLU, Sigmoid and tanh.&lt;/p&gt;'
