  title: Monitoring and Controlling of Soil Relative  Humidity using Labview
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The content here gives about the technique which is incorporated
    to monitor the moisture content in the soil and it enables agriculturalists feasibility
    of humidity measurement. According to this moisture control sensor circuit, it
    can observe the corresponding relative humidity and water the plants automatically
    by observing the conditions using LabVIEW system and myDAQ. The sensed signal
    from the sensor is interfaced to a LabVIEW loaded PC which acquires the signal
    as a voltage. With the help of counter pin, a submersible pump turns ON and OFF
    automatically to water the plants based on soils condition. Farmer can vary the
    time limit. When the time limit exceeds, he can view the LEDs and buzzer is in
    ON state. It is applicable in agriculture lands, land irrigation, simple sensors
    for gardeners.&lt;/p&gt;'
