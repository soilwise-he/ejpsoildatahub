  title: deliverable D-JRP15-FED-AMR-WP5.13 (Results of the soil microcosm experiments
    regarding environmental effects on competence gene expression
  abstract: Since the aim of work package 5 was to identify effects of environmental
    conditions that influence bacterial transformation, in task 5.3 a soil microcosm
    setting was created by utilizing non-manured agricultural soil. After initial
    tests, we concluded that <em>A. baylyi</em> was the more suitable species to show
    the effects on soil microcosms. First, RNA isolation from soil microcosms was
    established and later on RT-TaqMan qPCR systems for two competence genes and several
    <em>A. baylyi</em> housekeeping/reference genes were designed. Pilot experiments
    were carried out with having a look at differential competence gene expression
    levels in relation to environmental stimuli (temperature shift, exposure to antibiotics,
    different nutrient levels). The first results of this task are shown in the uploaded
    file.
