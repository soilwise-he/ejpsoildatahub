  title: Tropical Peat Soil Stabilization Using Class F Pond Ash From Coal Fired Power
    Plant
  abstract: 'This paper presents the stabilization potential of Class

    F pond ash (PA) from a coal fired thermal power station on tropical

    peat soil. Peat or highly organic soils are well known for their high

    compressibility, natural moisture content, low shear strength and

    long-term settlement. This study investigates the effect of different

    amount (i.e., 5, 10, 15 and 20%) of PA on peat soil, collected from

    Sarawak, Malaysia, mainly compaction and unconfined compressive

    strength (UCS) properties. The amounts of PA added to the peat soil

    sample as percentage of the dry peat soil mass. With the increase in

    PA content, the maximum dry density (MDD) of peat soil increases,

    while the optimum moisture content (OMC) decreases. The UCS

    value of the peat soils increases significantly with the increase of PA

    content and also with curing periods. This improvement on

    compressive strength of tropical peat soils indicates that PA has the

    potential to be used as a stabilizer for tropical peat soil. Also, the use

    of PA in soil stabilization helps in reducing the pond volume and

    achieving environment friendly as well as a sustainable development

    of natural resources.'
