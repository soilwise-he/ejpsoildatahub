  title: 'Seismic Wave Propagation in a Very Soft Alluvial Valley: Sensitivity to
    Ground-Motion Details and Soil Nonlinearity, and Generation of a Parasitic Vertical
    Component'
  abstract: 'This paper explores the sensitivity of 2D wave effects to crucial problem
    parameters, such as the frequency content of the base motion, its details, and
    soil non-linearity. A numerical study is conducted, utilizing a shallow soft valley
    as a test case. It is shown that wave focusing effects near valley edges and surface
    waves generated at valley corners are responsible for substantial aggravation
    (AG) of the seismic motion. With high-frequency seismic excitation, 1D soil amplification
    is prevailing at the central part of the valley, while 2D phenomena are localized
    near the edges. For low-frequency seismic excitation, wave focusing effects are
    overshadowed by laterally propagating surface waves, leading to a shift in the
    location of maximum AG towards the valley center. If the response is elastic,
    the details of the seismic excitation do not seem to play any role on the focusing
    effects at valley edges, but make a substantial difference at the valley center,
    where surface waves are dominant. The increase of damping mainly affects the propagation
    of surface waves, reducing AG at the valley center, but does not appear to have
    any appreciable effect at the valley edges. Soil nonlinearity may modify the 2D
    valley response significantly. For idealized single-pulse seismic excitations,
    AG at the valley center is reduced with increasing nonlinearity. Quite remarkably,
    for real multi-cycle seismic excitations AG at the valley edges may increase with
    soil nonlinearity. In contrast to the vertical component of an incident seismic
    motion, which is largely the result of P-waves and is usually of too high frequency
    to pose a serious threat to structures, the valley-generated parasitic vertical
    component could be detrimental to structures : being a direct result of 2D wave
    reflections/refractions, it is well correlated and with essentially the same dominant
    periods as the horizontal component'
