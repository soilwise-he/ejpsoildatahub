  title: On maintenance and metabolisms in soil microbial communities
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Biochemistry is an essential yet undervalued aspect of soil ecology,
    especially when analyzing soil C cycling. We assume, based on tradition, intuition
    or hope, that the complexity of biochemistry is confined to the microscopic world,
    and can be ignored when dealing with whole soil systems. This opinion paper draws
    attention to patterns caused by basic biochemical processes that permeate the
    world of ecosystem processes. From these patterns, we can estimate activities
    of the biochemical reactions of the central C metabolic network and gain insights
    into the ecophysiology of microbial biosynthesis, growth, and maintenance energy
    requirements: important components of Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE).&lt;/p&gt;'
