  title: Effects of red guinea corn and soybean plants growing on diesel polluted
    soil on the total heterotrophic and diesel degrading microbes
  abstract: "Effect of red guinea corn and soybean plants growing on diesel-polluted\
    \ soil on the total heterotrophic and diesel degrading microbes were studied.\
    \ Soil sample was collected from the Federal Polytechnic Nekede Owerri school\
    \ farm with the aid of a spade and transported to the preparation ground in clean\
    \ plastic buckets where it was sun-dried for 3 days. 3kg each of the sun-dried\
    \ loamy soil sample was weighed out in triplicates and each set was mixed with\
    \ 30ml, 150ml and 300ml of diesel to obtain 1% (set 1), 5% (set 2) and 10% (set\
    \ 3) pollutions, respectively, which were dispensed into perforated plastic buckets.\
    \ Each of these polluted soil samples was planted with the seeds of Red Guinea\
    \ Corn and Soybean plants. Controls were also set up. Each sample was set up in\
    \ duplicates. During the first and second week of the plant\u2019s growth, total\
    \ heterotrophic count, total diesel-utilizing microbes, and rhizosphere enumeration\
    \ were carried out. The results showed that the total heterotrophic count and\
    \ the hydrocarbon-utilizing microbes increased with increasing concentration of\
    \ the diesel oil mixture (10%&gt;5%&gt;1%) in both the polluted soil planted with\
    \ Red Guinea Corn and Soybeans. Similarly, the rhizosphere effects on both diesel\
    \ degrading microbes and total heterotrophic bacterial counts were found to have\
    \ increased with increase in percentage of diesel concentrations for both plants.\
    \ The microbial population and rhizosphere effects were more in the polluted samples\
    \ than in unpolluted ones. This implied that by encouraging these plants to grow\
    \ on diesel oil polluted soils, conditions for microbial degradation of the contaminants\
    \ can be enhanced and can increase the microbiota of the soil."
