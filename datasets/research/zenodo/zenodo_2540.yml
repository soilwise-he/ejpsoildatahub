  title: 'Trends in Soil Microbial Inoculants Research: A Science Mapping Approach
    to Unravel Strengths and Weaknesses of Their Application'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Microbial inoculants are widely accepted as potential alternatives
    or complements to&lt;br&gt;

    chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture. However, there remains a lack
    of knowledge&lt;br&gt;

    regarding their application and effects under field conditions. Thus, a quantitative
    description&lt;br&gt;

    of the scientific literature related to soil microbial inoculants was conducted,
    adopting a science&lt;br&gt;

    mapping approach to observe trends, strengths, and weaknesses of their application
    during the&lt;br&gt;

    period of 2000&ndash;2020 and providing useful insights for future research. Overall,
    the study retrieved&lt;br&gt;

    682 publications with an increasing number during the 2015&ndash;2020 period,
    confirming China, India,&lt;br&gt;

    and the U.S. as leading countries in microbial inoculants research. Over the last
    decade, the research&lt;br&gt;

    field emphasized the use of microbial consortia rather than single strains, with
    increasing attention&lt;br&gt;

    paid to sustainability and environmental purposes by means of multidisciplinary
    approaches. Among&lt;br&gt;

    the emerging topics, terms such as &ldquo;persistence&rdquo; indicate the actual
    need for detecting and monitoring&lt;br&gt;

    the persistence and fate of soil microbial inoculants. On the other hand, the
    low occurrence of terms&lt;br&gt;

    related to failed studies as well as formulation processes may have limited the
    overall comprehension&lt;br&gt;

    of the real potential of microbial inoculants to date. In conclusion, successful
    application of soil&lt;br&gt;

    microbial inoculants in agriculture requires filling the fundamental knowledge
    gaps related to the&lt;br&gt;

    processes that govern dynamics and interactions of the inoculants with soil and
    its native microbiota&lt;/p&gt;'
