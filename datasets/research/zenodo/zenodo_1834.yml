  title: "Effects of Palm Oil Mill Effluent on Soil Microflora and Fertility in Calabar\
    \ \u2013 Nigeria"
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;In the present study, an agricultural soil artificially amended\
    \ with different concentrations of palm oil mill effluent was analysed to determine\
    \ its impact on the soil microflora and other properties such as pH, organic matter,\
    \ electrical conductivity, and mineral elements. In the polluted soils, the total\
    \ heterotrophic bacteria, total heterotrophic fungi and total heterotrophic actinomycetes\
    \ decreased significantly (p\u22640.5) with increase in the concentration of the\
    \ pollutant. The total heterotrophic bacteria and total heterotrophic fungi showed\
    \ significant reduction (p\u22640.5) with increase in the duration of the pollution\
    \ while total heterotrophic actinomycetes showed no significance difference (p\u2265\
    0.5) over the duration of pollution. Suspected bacterial isolates from the polluted\
    \ soils were &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas sp&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus\
    \ sp., Micrococcus sp. Flavobacterium sp., Serratia sp., Proteus sp.,&lt;/em&gt;\
    \ while the suspected fungal isolates were &lt;em&gt;Mucor spp., Penicillum spp.,\
    \ Aspergillus spp. and Rhizopus spp. &lt;/em&gt;There were significant differences\
    \ (p\u22640.5) in soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, potassium, magnesium,\
    \ available phosphorus and base saturation of the polluted soil and that of the\
    \ control while the values of sodium, calcium, exchangeable acidity and electrical\
    \ conductivity of the polluted soil did not show significant difference with that\
    \ of the control. There was rather a steady increase which was not statistically\
    \ different from the control with increase in concentration of the pollutant.\
    \ The results of this study revealed that soil polluted with little quantities\
    \ of palm oil mill effluent could enhance microbial proliferation and thus, increase\
    \ soil fertility, while a heavy application inhibits the same.&lt;/p&gt;"
