  title: Managing compost stability and amendment to soil to enhance soil heating
    during soil solarization
  abstract: Soil solarization is a method of soil heating used to eradicate plant
    pathogens and weeds that involves passive solar heating of moist soil mulched
    (covered) with clear plastic tarp.  Various types of organic matter may be incorporated
    into soil prior to solarization to increase biocidal activity of the treatment
    process.  Microbial activity associated with the decomposition of soil organic
    matter may increase soil temperatures during solarization, potentially enhancing
    solarization efficacy.  However, the level of organic matter decomposition (stability)
    necessary for increasing soil temperature is not well characterized, nor is it
    known if various amendments render the soil phytotoxic to crops following solarization.  Laboratory
    studies and a field trial were performed to determine heat generation in soil
    amended with mature green waste compost and wheat bran during solarization. Respiration
    was measured in amended soil samples prior to and following solarization as a
    function of soil depth. Additionally, phytotoxicity was estimated through measurement
    of germination and early growth of lettuce seedlings in greenhouse assays.  Amendment
    of soil with 10% (g/g) compost (8% green waste + 2% wheat bran) containing 16.9
    mg CO2/g dry weight organic carbon resulted in soil temperatures that were 2oC
    to 4oC higher than soil alone. Approximately 85% of total organic carbon within
    the amended soil was exhausted during 22 days of solarization. There was no significant
    difference in residual respiration with soil depth down to 17.4 cm. Although freshly
    amended soil proved highly inhibitory to lettuce seed germination and seedling
    growth, phytotoxicity was not detected in solarized amended soil at any depth
    tested, between 0-17.4 cm, after 22 days of field solarization.
