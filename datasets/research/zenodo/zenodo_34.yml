  title: Portable Soil Analyzer
  abstract: <strong>The soil analyzer is a portable device which has features to collect
    soil samples from different parts of a given land and the samples are checked
    for parameters that are important in crop production.Movement of the system will
    be controlled by chain wheels powered by DC geared motor. The collected data values
    are cross checked against the threshold values in a database to provide proper
    information about the types of crops that are suitable to be cultivated in that
    land under study. This information can be properly channelized by an app so that
    the idea is rightly conveyed to the farmers or the land owners.</strong>
