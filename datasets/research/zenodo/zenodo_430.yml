  title: 'SOIL-INSECT toolbox: A new chamber for analysing the behaviour of herbivorous
    insects and tri-trophic interactions in soil'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A chamber, named SOIL-INSECT toolbox, was developed to analyse
    the effect of various factors on the behaviour of soil-dwelling insects. It is
    equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the concentration of CO2 in the
    different compartments of the chamber without disturbing the air balance in the
    soil. The chamber can be adapted to study different stimuli, including volatile
    compounds, both in the presence and absence of plants. The chamber was tested
    using the larvae of Melolontha spp., which confi rmed its suitability for carrying
    out complex studies on insect-insect and insect-plant-microbiome interactions
    in a complex environment such as soil. The results of behavioural experiments
    using L3 larvae of Melolontha spp. in sterilized and natural soils revealed that
    the soil condition affected the behaviour of the larvae, likely due to its effect
    on the soil microbiome and physicochemical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;'
