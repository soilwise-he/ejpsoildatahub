  title: Removal Of Cationic Heavy Metal And Hoc From Soil-Washed Water Using Activated
    Carbon
  abstract: Soil washing process with a surfactant solution is a potential technology
    for the rapid removal of hydrophobic organic compound (HOC) from soil. However,
    large amount of washed water would be produced during operation and this should
    be treated effectively by proper methods. The soil washed water for complex contaminated
    site with HOC and heavy metals might contain high amount of pollutants such as
    HOC and heavy metals as well as used surfactant. The heavy metals in the soil
    washed water have toxic effects on microbial activities thus these should be removed
    from the washed water before proceeding to a biological waste-water treatment
    system. Moreover, the used surfactant solutions are necessary to be recovered
    for reducing the soil washing operation cost. In order to simultaneously remove
    the heavy metals and HOC from soil-washed water, activated carbon (AC) was used
    in the present study. In an anionic-nonionic surfactant mixed solution, the Cd(II)
    and phenanthrene (PHE) were effectively removed by adsorption on activated carbon.
    The removal efficiency for Cd(II) was increased from 0.027 mmol-Cd/g-AC to 0.142
    mmol-Cd/g-AC as the mole ratio of SDS increased in the presence of PHE. The adsorptive
    capacity of PHE was also increased according to the SDS mole ratio due to the
    decrement of molar solubilization ratios (MSR) for PHE in an anionic-nonionic
    surfactant mixture. The simultaneous adsorption of HOC and cationic heavy metals
    using activated carbon could be a useful method for surfactant recovery and the
    reduction of heavy metal toxicity in a surfactant-enhanced soil washing process.
