  title: 'Degradation of organic pollutants combining plasma discharges generated
    within soil with TiO2 and ZnO catalysts: Comparative analysis, optimization and
    mechanisms'
  abstract: 'An advantageous cold atmospheric plasma setup in which micro-discharges
    are generated directly into the interconnected soil channels was combined for
    the first time with TiO2 and ZnO catalysts towards the degradation of trifluralin.
    In the presence of these catalysts, a significant increase of the degradation
    efficiency and rate was observed for both TiO2 and ZnO, with TiO2 being a slightly
    superior catalyst compared to ZnO. The dominance of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
    over reactive nitrogen species (RNS) was determined by using different plasma
    gases whereas the inhibitory effect of soil humidity in the degradation process
    was also confirmed, although less pronounced in the presence of catalysts. The
    detection of plasma species in the gas phase and the exhaust gases revealed that
    the presence of TiO2 and ZnO resulted in a significant increase in NO2 concentration
    and a noticeable reduction in O3 generation compared to the plasma alone process
    associated with an increase of certain plasma species concentration and the generation
    of additional and more active ROS, respectively. Liquid chromatography (UPLC/MS)
    data at the early stages of the degradation process in the presence and absence
    of the photocatalysts provided insight into the mechanisms and intermediates involved
    in the degradation of trifluralin in soil under plasma co-operative catalysis.
    Finally, the significance of the method in the context of energy efficiency was
    exemplified. Inclusion of a catalyst in our system resulted in a ~3fold increase
    in energy efficiency. The present effort supports the potential of future implementation
    of a plasmacatalytic-based soil remediation method being a rapid, highly efficient,
    low energy demanding and green method.Keywords: Plasmacatalysis; Dielectric barrier
