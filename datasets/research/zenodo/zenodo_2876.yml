  title: 'A comprehensive review on rice (Oryza sativa l.): organic and inorganic
    sources with zinc on yield attributes and soil health'
  abstract: Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a common nutritional disorder that adversely affects
    human health as well as one of the major abiotic factors limiting rice productivity
    globally. Studies of Zn dynamics and management in rice soils are crucial because
    rice is a staple food for people in many nations. As a result of climate change,
    growers are being forced to give up the traditional activity of transplanting
    rice into flooded soils and replace it with water-saving techniques like aerobic
    rice culture and alternative wetting and drying systems. Plant development and
    growth depend on nutrients. In order investigate the role of nutrients, nutrient
    deficiency, and toxicity in rice, prior works have been evaluated over this review.
    Rice plants require both macronutrients and micronutrients. Each nutrient has
    a different character and is involved in various kinds of plant metabolic processes.
    The disease tolerance or pathogen resistance of plants is influenced by nutrients.
    Conditions of nutrient toxicity and deficiency interfere with normal plant growth
    and show identifiable symptoms. Plants require all the essential nutrients in
    the right proportions for optimum development, growth, and production. The management
    of its integrated nutrients has many advantages for improving soil fertility and
    long-term crop productivity. For sustainable and higher rice production, the knowledge
    provided in this review article will be helpful to rice growers and researchers.
