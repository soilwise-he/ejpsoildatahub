  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to present the relationship between\
    \ soil properties and biodiversity indexes in upland fir (&lt;em&gt;Abies alba&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ forest associations (&lt;em&gt;Abietetum albae&lt;/em&gt;). Our study was conducted\
    \ in six areas representing the growth conditions of upland fir forests and the\
    \ research plots were located in the Roztocza\u0144ski and \u015Awi\u0119tokrzyski\
    \ National Parks as well as Przedb&oacute;rz, Radomsko, Piotrk&oacute;w and Jan&oacute;w\
    \ lubelski Forest District. on every plot, the topography was described, soil\
    \ cores were examined and samples for laboratory analysis were taken. the following\
    \ characteristics were determined for the soil samples: ph, c, n, ca, Mg, na and\
    \ K content, particle size, exchangeable acidity, aluminum content and hydrolytic\
    \ acidity. additionally, enzyme activity in the soil samples (urease and dehydrogenase)\
    \ was measured. in each test area, the stand characteristics were measured (diameter\
    \ at breast height and height), floristic characteristics were described and the\
    \ biodiversity indexes (Shannon, Simpson and Margalef indexes) were calculated.\
    \ Different soil types (gleysols, Brunic arenosols, gleyic Podzols and hyperdistric\
    \ cambisols) were recorded for the investigated forest stands and the soils were\
    \ categorized according to soil texture, c content, enzyme activity and different\
    \ humus types (moder-mor, moder, moder-mull). the upland mixed coniferous forest\
    \ sites were characterized by lower biodiversity indexes (2.6 shannon index; 0.72\
    \ simpson index; 4.9 Margalef index) while the upland mixed broadleaf forest sites\
    \ showed higher indexes (3.3 Shannon index; 0.87 Simpson index; 9.4 Margalef index).\
    \ The site index obtained for the fir stands confirmed these results.&lt;/p&gt;"
