  title: The Occurrence of Cryptosporidium Species in Soil and Manure in Jos and Environs,
    Plateau State, Nigeria.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the mean occurrence of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;oocysts
    in soil and manure samples, samples were collected from some of the areas visited
    in Jos North &amp; South LGA of Plateau State, Nigeria. Samples were analysed
    for the presence of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;species.&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;species
    were determined by parasitological techniques (Formol-ether and floatation concentration
    techniques Staining was done using Zielh Neelsen technique, Mac-Master counting
    technique was used for the determination of the frequency of occurrence). Our
    results revealed higher means in the dry season with means of 19.2, 13.4 and 12.6
    recorded for the months of January, February and March respectively than the rainy
    season that recorded the means of 6.8, 5.8, and 4.2 for the months of June, July
    and August. These results are discussed in relation to the epidemiology, distribution
    and significance of&lt;em&gt;Cryptosporidium&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;to the farmers that
    are constantly in contact with the samples and the impact of the contagious effect
    of these parasites in the environment on humans and animals.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
