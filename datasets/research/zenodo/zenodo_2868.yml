  title: Nitrogen availability in digestates from full-scale biogas plants following
    soil application as affected by operation parameters and input feedstocks
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Biogas operation parameters are usually optimised to enhance
    biogas yields while ignoring&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about digestate from

    This study evaluated the effects of varying operation parameters and input&nbsp;&lt;a
    title="Learn more about feedstocks from ScienceDirect''s AI-generated Topic Pages"
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/feedstock"&gt;feedstocks&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;used
    in co-digestion with manure on digestate properties and N turnover in soil for
    80&nbsp;days. Net inorganic N release (% of N input) from digestates varied significantly
    (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001) due to their contrasting properties.

    retention time&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(HRT), manure type and input feedstocks significantly
    influenced soil inorganic N release. Animal slurry co-digested with energy crops
    had the highest average net soil inorganic N release at 67&nbsp;%, while co-digestion
    with straw-based feedstock had the lowest at 56&nbsp;%. Feedstock type greatly
    influenced the choice of digesting temperature and HRT, with most energy crop-based
    feedstocks digested at &lt;50&nbsp;days HRT. Digestate properties NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;-N/total

    concentration&lt;/a&gt; significantly influenced net inorganic N release in soil.
    A better understanding of the effects of biogas operation variables on nutrient
    availability and digestate fertilising properties could help design and optimise
    the anaerobic digestion process to increase biogas yields and N fertiliser value
    of the digestates.&lt;/p&gt;'
