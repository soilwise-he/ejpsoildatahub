  title: THE EFFECT OF AMENDMENT APPLICATION TO SOIL QUALITY OF NEW PADDY FIELDS IN
    TEUREUBEH VILLAGE, ACEH BESAR DISTRICT.
  abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) are the main food crops in Indonesia because most
    of Indonesia\\\'s population consumes rice as a staple food. The need for rice
    which continues to increase is not balanced with optimal land availability. The
    conversion of land, especially rice fields which are residential areas is one
    of the government\\\'s obstacles in increasing rice production. In addition, a
    decrease in the quality of soil in terms of soil chemical properties also becomes
    a problem that must be solved. In this study, an experiment was conducted on the
    use of various types of ameliorant in new rice fields in Teureubeh Village, Aceh
    Besar District. This study used the Factorial Randomized Block Design. The first
    factor is a new type of rice variety (V) consisting of 3 levels, namely Sanberasi
    U1 (V1), Sanberasi U3 (V2), and Inpari 30 (V4). The second factor is soil amelioration
    material (A) which consists of 3 levels namely control (A0), rice husk biochar
    (A1), rice straw compost (A2), and repeated 3 times so that there are 27 units
    of experimental units. The results show that there is no significant effect on
    improving the quality of new rice fields, however there was a significant effect
    on the growth of new type of rice local variety.
