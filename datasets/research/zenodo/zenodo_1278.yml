  title: Productivity of date palm as affected by irrigation in a sandy soil
  abstract: "A field experiment was conducted on drip irrigated date palm trees (Barhi\
    \ var.) in a private farm during the 2020 and 2021 seasons to evaluate the effect\
    \ of five irrigation treatments (120, 100, 80, and 60% ETo and farmer practice)\
    \ on amounts of applied irrigation water (AIW), consumptive use (CU), date yield\
    \ and its components, fruit quality, water use efficiency (WUE), water productivity\
    \ (WP), consumed electric energy, net income, a local date crop coefficient (Kc)\
    \ and yield response factor (Ky). Results revealed that, average ETo values varied\
    \ between 1.26 mm/day in December and 9.85 mm/day in July. The 2\u2013year average\
    \ AIW values were 17 377, 14 546, 11 715, 8 885 and 24 680 m<sup>3</sup>/ha for\
    \ the 120, 100, 80 and 60% ETo treatments and farmer practice, respectively. Highest\
    \ and lowest fruit yields of 39.2 and 15.2 t/ha were recorded for the 120% and\
    \ 60% ETo treatments, respectively. The WP values of the same treatments were\
    \ 2.27 and 1.23 kg fruits/m<sup>3</sup>. Seasonal average Kc value of 0.74 is\
    \ obtained for the 120% ETo treatment. The Ky value of 1.187 is obtained for the\
    \ Barhi variety. The lowest consumed energy (64.7%) and highest net income (31.8%)\
    \ were recorded for 60% and 120% ETo treatments compared with farmer practice."
