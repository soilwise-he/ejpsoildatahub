  title: THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE LONGITUDINAL  DISTANCE OF A PLUG-SOFTENER
    THAT WORKS WITHOUT  TURNING THE SOIL BETWEEN GARDEN ROWS
  abstract: The article provides brief information about the current state of tillage
    in our country and tillage machines used in foreign countries. In addition, there
    is a brief description of the current problems and solutions of tillage technologies
    and agro technical requirements of tillage. Today's tillage tools used in horticulture
    and their disadvantages and advantages of energy-efficient soil-protecting inclined
    column plow-softener are theoretically based on its parameters. The parameters
    of the inclined column plug softener were based on the results obtained from the
    theoretical experimental studies
