  title: Calculation of Metal Pollution Index and Enrichment Factor in Sodic Soil
    from Salt Production Area
  abstract: 'In the present paper, the sodic soil samples were collected from the
    salt production area of Thakhauttaw, Hanlin, Sataung Gyi and Paline, Shwebo District,
    Sagaing Region. These samples were studied on the elemental analysis using the
    energy dispersive x ray fluorescence EDXRF spectroscopy. In order to evaluate
    the contamination status of metals, assessment indices such as metal pollution
    index MPI and enrichment factors EFs have been calculated by using the metal concentrations
    from the EDXRF results. The values of metal pollution index MPI for all samples
    were less than 1. This indicating the sodic soil was no significant of metal pollution.
    The results of enrichment factors show that Ca and Mn considerable enriched levels
    in the soil. According to health physics point of view, the overall study suggests
    that the sodic soil from salt production area were not metal contaminated and
    long term consumption cannot be cause potential health risks to consumers. Tin
