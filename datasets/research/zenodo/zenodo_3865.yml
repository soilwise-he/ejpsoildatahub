  title: Prevalence and Intensity of Soil Transmitted Helminths among School Children
    in Ifetedo, Osun State, Nigeria
  abstract: "The study assessed the prevalence, intensity and risk factors affecting\
    \ the transmission of soil transmitted helminthiasis among school-age children\
    \ in Ifetedo, Osun State, Nigeria with the view to determining the patterns of\
    \ transmission of the diseases in the area. The study involved stool examination\
    \ for infective stages of soil-transmitted helminth parasites using some parasitological\
    \ analysis. Ascariasis, Trichiuriasis and hookworms infection were the only soil\
    \ transmitted helminthes (STHs) infections observed among the pupils. The overall\
    \ prevalence of the diseases was 44.2% (175 of 396 pupils). The sex related prevalence\
    \ showed that males (48.6%) were more infected than females (40.4%). The peak\
    \ prevalence (45.9%) was recorded among the 6-9 years old age group and lowest\
    \ (42.4%) among the youngest children (\u2264 5 years old age group)."
