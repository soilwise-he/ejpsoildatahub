  title: Implementation of Farm Weeding and Soil Moisturization Techniques using Agribot
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agriculture plays a vital role in Indian economy sector as it
    contributes about 17% to the total GDP. This agribot project aims at reducing
    the work of farmers in addition to increasing the speed and accuracy of the work.
    It fulfills the fundamental functions of agriculture such as seed sowing, fertilizer
    mist and arm gripper. The above feature is carried out using Arduino mega 2560,
    soil moisturization sensor, temperature sensor (LM35 sensor), L293D driver, DC
    servo motor, ESP8266 module, relay, power supply, WIFI camera and mobile app.
    Our project work is implemented using IOT methodology. This system is efficient
    and operator friendly. This is particularly important for workers in the area
    where health and jobs are potentially harmful.&lt;/p&gt;'
