  title: Environmental Assessment Of Soil Erosion On Laknavaram Lake Basin
  abstract: 'The aim of this work is to estimate soil erosion on Laknavaram lake basin,
    JayashankarBhupalpally district, Telangana. Soils play a major role in production
    of food, storage of water, nutrients and organic matter. Loss of soils effects
    its ability to perform these functions. Soil loss reduces its potential in crop
    production, damages drainage network, decreases the capacity of hydraulic structures.
    Estimation of soil erosion in this study has been done using USLE model. The USLE
    was developed from soil erosion plot and rainfall simulator experiments. The USLE
    is composed of six factors to estimate the average annual soil loss (A). The equation
    includes rainfall erosivity factor(R), soil erodibility factor (K), the topographic
    factors (L and S), cover management(C), practice management (P).The equation takes
    the simple product form: A=R.K.LS.C.P (Where LS is calculated together as a single
    factor).'
