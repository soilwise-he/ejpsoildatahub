  title: Shear Strength Characteristics and Energy Absorption Capacity of Soil-Tire
    Crumb Mixtures
  abstract: Discarding and recycling of tire waste is a major environmental issue
    in the present. Earthquake hazards are becoming a major concern for all the countries
    and its mitigation measures have taken the center stage of research in the field.
    In this regard, tire crumbs being a waste material were mixed with soil samples
    at different proportions to determine its effect on shear strength characteristics
    and energy absorption capacity. The primary objective of this study involves determining
    the shear strength characteristics, energy absorption capacity and brittleness
    index of Soil-Tire Crumb Mixture (STCM) by performing Direct Shear and Unconsolidated
    Undrained (UU) Triaxial test on disturbed soil samples. Soil samples were collected
    from various site locations of East Bengaluru based on borehole data. Tire crumbs
    were mixed with the soil in varying percentages from 0-10% by mass of soil at
    an increment of 2.5%. Stress-strain curves for direct shear and UU Triaxial shear
    test for different confining pressures were plotted. Experimental results showed
    that the direct shear strength and UU Triaxial strength of STCM increased up to
    54.14kPa and 226.26kPa respectively. This increase was observed only in the soils
    which contained coarse-grained particles in excess of 50%. Further, energy absorption
    capacity and brittleness index were calculated from the stress-strain curve. Its
    application to earthquake resistant design must be studied in detail in terms
    of site response.
