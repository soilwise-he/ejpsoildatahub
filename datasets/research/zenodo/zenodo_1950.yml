  title: 'Soil liquefaction and induced damage to structures: a case study from the
    2012 Emilia earthquake.'
  abstract: "A database of masonry buildings located in a number of municipalities\
    \ struck by the 2012 Emilia earthquake has been analyzed for this work. Post seismic\
    \ survey was carried out by the Italian Department of Civil Protection soon after\
    \ the earthquake. The database included information on building characteristics,\
    \ level and extent of damage to structural and non-structural components. Additionally,\
    \ data on ground conditions and the results of in-situ tests (CPT) were collected.\
    \ The comparative analysis of observed damage has shown evidences of the impact\
    \ of soil liquefaction on structures. It led to the formation of unusual crack\
    \ patterns on the structure compared to the typical inertial damage. The correlation\
    \ between structural damage and soil liquefaction was then investigated with reference\
    \ to an exemplificative case of study in the hamlet of San Carlo (Sant\u2019Agostino\
    \ municipality). A simplified procedure for estimating liquefactioninduced building\
    \ settlement was applied, obtaining an estimated settlement compatible with the\
    \ observed damage."
