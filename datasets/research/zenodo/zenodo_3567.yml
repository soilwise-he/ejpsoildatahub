  title: 'The physical structure of soil: Determinant and consequence of trophic interactions'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Trophic interactions play a vital role in soil functioning and
    are increasingly considered as important drivers of&lt;br&gt;

    the soil microbiome and biogeochemical cycles. In the last decade, novel tools
    to decipher the structure of soil&lt;br&gt;

    food webs have provided unprecedent advance in describing complex trophic interactions.
    Yet, the major&lt;br&gt;

    challenge remains to understand the drivers of the trophic interactions. Evidence
    suggests that small scale soil&lt;br&gt;

    physical structure may offer a unifying framework for understanding the nature
    and patterns of trophic interactions&lt;br&gt;

    in soils. Here, we review the current knowledge of how restrictions on soil organisms&rsquo;
    ability to sense&lt;br&gt;

    and access food resources/prey inherent to soil physical structure essentially
    shape trophic interactions. We focus&lt;br&gt;

    primarily on organisms unable to deform the soil and create pores themselves,
    such as bacteria, fungi, protists,&lt;br&gt;

    nematodes and microarthropods, and consider pore geometry, connectivity and hydration
    status as main descriptors&lt;br&gt;

    of the soil physical structure. We point that the soil physical structure appears
    to mostly limit the&lt;br&gt;

    sensing and accessibility to food resources/prey, with negative effects on bottom
    up controls. The main mechanisms&lt;br&gt;

    are (i) the reduced transport of sensing molecules, notably volatiles, through
    the soil matrix and (ii) the&lt;br&gt;

    wide presence of refuges leading to pore size segregation of consumer/predators
    and food sources/prey in pores&lt;br&gt;

    of contrasting size. In addition, variations in the connectivity of the soil pores
    and the water film is suggested as a&lt;br&gt;

    central aspect driving encounter probability between consumers/predator and food
    source/prey and hence&lt;br&gt;

    locally decrease or increase top-down controls. Constraints imposed by the soil
    physical structure on trophic&lt;br&gt;

    interactions are thought to be major drivers of the soil diversity and local community
    assemblage, notably by&lt;br&gt;

    favoring a variety of adaptations to feed in this dark labyrinth (food specialists/flexible/generalists)
    and by&lt;br&gt;

    limiting competitive exclusion through limited encounter probability of consumers.
    We conclude with possible&lt;br&gt;

    future ways for an interdisciplinary and more quantitative research merging soil
    physics and soil food web&lt;br&gt;

    ecology.&lt;/p&gt;'
