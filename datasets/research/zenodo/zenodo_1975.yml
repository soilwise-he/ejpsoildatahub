  title: Fragility curves for existing reinforced concrete buildings, including soil-structure
    interaction and site amplification effects
  abstract: SSI and site amplification effects are investigated as influences on the
    seismic fragility of existing reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame and dual
    frame-wall system buildings supported on shallow foundations without interconnecting
    beams. We build upon a holistic methodology that accounts for site amplification
    and soil-foundation-structure interaction effects using a modular approach. We
    calculate fragility curves based on nonlinear dynamic analyses for various building
    structural typologies and geometries, infill conditions, code provisions, and
    soil profile materials and dynamic characteristics. We demonstrate that site amplification
    during earthquakes may significantly increase the fragility of the soil-foundation-structure
    system, which is reflected in its vulnerability. Moreover, SSI is especially prevalent
    for buildings on soft soil profiles and might modify their fragility. We propose
    a modular method to include site amplification and/or soil-structure interaction
    effects in a large-scale earthquake vulnerability assessment using fragility modifiers,
    which we express using an easy-to-code equation form.
