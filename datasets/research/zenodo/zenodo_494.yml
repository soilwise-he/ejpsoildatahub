  title: Role of biogas slurry in soil health development
  abstract: The decrease in crop output prompts an increase in the use of various
    chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural fields. Such chemical inputs
    not only put human life and the environment in danger, but they also pose a serious
    threat to soil and agriculture. Three significant issues of using the nitrogenous
    chemical fertilizers are rising costs, financial loss, and environmental risks.
    Therefore, it is essential to switch from traditional methods to those that are
    more environmentally friendly, such as reducing the use of chemical fertilizers
    or promoting organic farming for the development of soil health.
