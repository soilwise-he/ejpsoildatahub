  title: 'Impact of Sustainable Land Management Practices on Soil Properties: Example
    of Organic and Integrated Agricultural Management'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Maintaining good soil quality is crucial for the sustainability
    of agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the visual soil
    assessment (VSA) method by testing it on two soil types and two agricultural management
    practices (AMP) (organic and integrated) that are considered to protect soil quality.
    We selected two farms with plots on two river terraces with different soil properties.
    The test was based on the modified method Annual Crops Visual Quality Assessment
    developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and supported
    by a standardized soil physical and chemical analysis. This study showed that
    the assessed score is highly dependent on the type of farming practice and how
    soils are managed. The soil type also plays an important role. The results for
    Calcaric Fluvisol showed that the effects of selected agricultural management
    practices on the visual assessment of soil quality could be almost undetectable.
    The time of assessment also plays a significant role in VSA scoring. Different
    crops and agricultural activities with significant impacts on the soil occur throughout
    the year (especially in vegetable production). It was observed that a higher score
    for the soil cover indicator had a beneficial effect on the total VSA rating.&lt;/p&gt;'
