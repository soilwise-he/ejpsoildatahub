  title: The Database of the Subsoil in Flanders (DOV) related to soil and archaeological
    research.
  abstract: <strong>ABSRACT:</strong> Soil data in Flanders are included in the DOV
    soil database available to all users. As such, the work done by soil surveyors
    and scientists is still very relevant today. This paper explains what kind of
    soil data are included in DOV and how they can be consulted. The aim of DOV is
    to become the reference for sharing data, knowledge and services, about the soil
    and subsoil of Flanders. It concerns open data, which can be integrated and linked
    to other data sources. In addition to raw data, DOV offers professional knowledge
    and interpreted information, as well as the services and applications to activate
    and mobilize these data.
