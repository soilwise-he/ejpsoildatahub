  title: Genotype-by-environment interaction and yield stability for grain yield of
    quality protein maize hybrids under low and optimum soil nitrogen environments
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Maize (Zea mays L.) yield performance is determined by the effects of
    genotype and environment, and genotype &times; environment interaction (GEI).
    A complete diallel crosses of 11 QPM inbred lines were evaluated under both low
    and optimum soil nitrogen environments to identify high grain yield performance
    and yield stability of single-cross hybrids in six environments. The results of
    analysis of variance showed that variations among hybrids attributable to genotypes
    (G), environments (E), and genotype &times; environment interactions (GEI) were
    significant for grain yield. The result of the AMMI analysis showed that grain
    yield performance of the genotypes was significantly affected by environments,
    genotypes and GEI across six environments. The GGE biplot showed the sum of the
    first and second principal component axes explained 61.66% of the total variation.
    Genotype TL156583 &times; TL156612 was identified as the best genotype among hybrids
    across six environments, and less stable than genotype MHQ138 which was the poorest
    genotype but stable across all environments. AMMI stability value identified TL155976
    &times; TL156583, TL156583 &times; TL155932, and TL156579 &times; TL156583 as
    stable genotypes, and TL156583 &times; VL05128, TL156583 &times; TL147078, and
    TL156579 &times; TL155976 as unstable ones. GGE-biplot identified genotype TL156583
    &times; VL05128 to be the winner in E6 (Dire-Dawa optimum N) whereas genotype
    TL156612 &times; TL148288 was the winner in E 2 (Raare optimum N) and E5 (Dire-Dawa
    low N). Genotype TL156579 &times; TL155976 won in E1 (Raare low N) and E5 (Dire-Dawa
    low N).&lt;/p&gt;'
