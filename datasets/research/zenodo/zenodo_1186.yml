  title: Design and Calibration of a Low-Cost SDI-12 Soil Moisture Sensor
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Water is the main limiting factor in agricultural production
    as well as a scarce resource that needs to be optimized. The measurement of soil
    water with sensors is an efficient way for optimal irrigation management. However,
    commercial sensors are still too expensive for most farmers. This paper presents
    the design, development and calibration of a new capacitive low-cost soil moisture
    sensor that incorporates SDI-12 communication, allowing one to select the calibration
    equation for different soils. The sensor was calibrated in three different soils
    and its variability and accuracy were evaluated. Lower but cost-compensated accuracy
    was observed in comparing it with commercial sensors. Field tests have demonstrated
    the temperature influence on the sensor and its capability to efficiently detect
    irrigation and rainfall events.&lt;/p&gt;'
