  title: 'The impact of intercropping, tillage and fertilizer type on soil and crop
    yield in fruit orchards under Mediterranean conditions: A meta-analysis of field
    studies'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis specially based on tree crops was conducted
    to evaluate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), soil N and P, and crop yield
    in a Mediterranean climate, which are affected by: (i) management practices (crop
    diversification, tillage, fertilization); (ii) environmental characteristics,
    such as soil clay and climatic variables; and (iii) study length. The aim of this
    study was to assess the benefits of crop diversification, conservation tillage
    (minimum tillage/no-tillage) and organic fertilization as alternatives to intensive
    conventional mono-cropping in field studies. All the diversified systems and conservation
    tillage systems and the use of organic fertilizers induced positive effects on
    SOC. The highest response in SOC was achieved by the growth of permanent crops
    in the alleys. Soil N showed a similar trend to that of SOC, but the effect of
    no-tillage was not significant compared to conventional tillage. No significant
    effect was observed in soil P except for the cultivation of permanent crops in
    the alleys, which had a negative effect. No effect was observed in tree crop yield
    due to the growth of alley crops, conservation tillage or organic fertilization.
    However, the response of crop yield was related to the specific climatic conditions
    of each region, with possible negative effects in warm and dry areas. Overall,
    the use of intercropping, conservation tillage and organic fertilization led to
    improvements in soil quality and fertility and maintenance of a ground cover that
    can protect soil. However, to avoid possible negative effects on soil P and N
    availability, the growth of annual alley crops with minimum tillage is suggested
    instead of permanent crops with no-tillage, especially in dry and warm areas.
    Our results also suggested that the soil properties evaluated were not the main
    drivers of long-term yield variability.&lt;/p&gt;'
