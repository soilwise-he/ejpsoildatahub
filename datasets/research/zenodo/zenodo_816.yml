  title: WG3_T2.4_Review of possibilities of correlating soil physical and chemical
    variables
  abstract: Apart from being a heterogeneous and dynamic system, soil complexity rises
    from the connections and interdependencies between its attributes. The correlation
    of soil properties can be employed to denote the association between quantitative
    variables and determine the extent and the way they are related. Furthermore,
    the correlations may disclose the predictive relationships of interest. The survey
    of the literature was made to summarize mathematical and statistical tools used
    for the analysis of the association between physical and chemical parameters of
    the soil. In line with the specific goals of COST Action SAGA, particular attention
    was paid to the available correlation of data relevant for archaeological sites.
    The selected soil parameters and the methods used for the description of their
    linear and more complex non-linear relationships are outlined. The correlation
    of soil properties has been employed with much broader goals and objectives in
    other sub-disciplines of soil science, such as to analyze, explain, estimate,
    and predict different characteristics and processes. Some of these studies are
    reviewed to illustrate the methods of correlation that may be of interest in the
    archaeological context.
