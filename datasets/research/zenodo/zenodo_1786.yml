  title: 'Environmentally-Mediated Epigenetic Effects: Uncovering The Fertile Soil
    In The Development Of Pediatric Cancer'
  abstract: 'Abstract:


    Objectives: We reviewed the literature to identify the evidence about the potential
    link between the environmental effects &amp; the increased susceptibility to pediatric
    cancer, and explained how these factors may be transferred to initiate &amp; promote
    the development of pediatric cancer through epigenetic mechanisms.


    Methods: First, we highlighted the role of epigenetics in embryogenesis &amp;
    development, and then we presented some evidence from animal models about trans-generational
    inheritance &amp; the potential transfer of environmental effects through multiple
    generations to effect development of disease phenotypes by evolutionary epigenetic
    remodeling or even could drive genomic variations at the long term.  In addition,
    we addressed some studies that relate specific environmental exposures to the
    increased susceptibility to specific pediatric cancer types, and finally we shed
    the light on aberrant reprogramming in early developmental stages &amp; the potential
    link between developmental malformations &amp; childhood cancer.


    Results: The environmentally-acquired epigenetic marks may influence the control
    of gene regulation through DNA methylation, histone modification, or through a
    large set of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These epigenetic effects might be passed
    on to the developing embryo and child as inheritable non-genetic marks, which
    recapitulate previous lifelong history of exposure to environmental influences
    that start from the stage of primordial germ cell, passing through the maturing
    germ cell, and ending by the zygote stage. This involves the paternally transmitted
    information on the sperm that contribute to modulating embryogenesis functions
    and later childhood development, in concert with, the maternally transmitted information
    encountered by the exposure to a large milieu of environmental factors either
    periconceptionally or during lactation period.


    Conclusion: Environmentally- mediated epigenetic effects could have a clue for
    unique criteria that have been associated with pediatric cancer, such as presence
    of global epigenetic changes, heterogeneity, diversity, and regression of some
    tumors.  To uncover many of unanswered questions, more focused research should
    be carried out through longitudinal studies that address the effects of various
    environmental influences involving successive generations using integrated genetic
    &amp; epigenetic approaches to gain insights &amp; accumulate further evidence
    about the interplay between genetics, epigenetics &amp; exposure, and its possible
    role in initiation, promotion &amp; progression of different pediatric tumors.'
