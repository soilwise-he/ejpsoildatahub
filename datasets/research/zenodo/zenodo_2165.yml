  title: 'Zebrafish: An Animal Model For Testing Suitability Of Pseudomonas Species
    For Bioremediation Of Pesticide Influenced Soil'
  abstract: "Prolonged usage of chemicals in agriculture has devastated biodiversity\
    \ to a large extent including microbial diversity and density.  Upon intense exposure\
    \ certain microorganisms acclimatize to chemical influenced soil and exploit those\
    \ chemicals as their sole source of carbon and/or nitrogen. Bioremediation studies\
    \ over the past decades predominantly imply on isolation of Pseudomonas species\
    \ with the property to consume chemical contaminants as their source of energy.\
    \ Pseudomonas spp. have adapted themselves to extreme conditions by altering their\
    \ metabolic pathway. Hence these can be to some extent denoted as bio-indicators\
    \ of chemical contaminants. But suggesting Pseudomonas spp. for field study or\
    \ for bioremediation threatens us in particular with the development of antibiotic\
    \ resistance and instigating secondary infections, thus restricting their application.\
    \ The present study involves in possibility of Pseudomonas species to be considered\
    \ for bioremediation by testing their ability in causing mortality in zebrafish.\
    \ Isolates for the comparative study include           P. aeruginosa (clinical\
    \ isolate), P. aeruginosa (soil isolate with pesticide degradation property) and\
    \     P. pseudoalcaligenes (soil isolate with pesticide\u2019s carrier molecule\
    \ degradation property). Results obtained confer that antibiotic resistance and\
    \ mortality caused by the clinical strain was significantly higher thus advocating\
    \ an affirmative annotation for the field application of soil isolates."
