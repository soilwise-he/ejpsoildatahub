  title: Effect of Organic Fertilizers Application on Growth, Yield and Quality of
    Tomatoes in North Kordofan (sandy soil) western Sudan
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Study was conducted in Bara locality of North Kordofan state,
    for two consecutive winter seasons (2009/2010). The objective of the study was
    to investigate the effect of different types of organic fertilizers on soil chemical
    and physical properties, and on growth, yield and quality of tomatoes fruits.
    The experiment consisted of five treatments. The treatments were laid in a randomized
    complete block designed (RCBD) with three replications. Soil analysis showed that
    the experimental area is dominated by sandy soil texture. Tomato seeds were planted
    in the nursery and then transplanted into the field after five weeks. Data collected
    Soil sampling and analysis, Results of soil samples analysis showed significant
    (p&le;0.05) change in the soil chemical and physical properties and increase in
    the amount of organic matter content especially. The production indicators showed
    that the tomatoes Agronomic parameters were significantly (P &le; 0.05), affected
    by the addition of different sources of organic fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;'
