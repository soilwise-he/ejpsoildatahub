  title: Textile Mill Wastewater Treatability Studies By Soil Aquifer Treatment System
    In Conjunction With Natural Adsorbents
  abstract: Water resources around the world are under increasing pressure from the
    rapidly growing demands of rising population and industrialization. It is not
    only the depletion of quantity but also the quality is deteriorating due to indiscriminate
    discharge of untreated industrial waste waters and sewage generated from the community.
    Therefore treatment of wastewater for disposal and reuse is necessary for safe
    and sustainable environment. Several treatment techniques are adopted for better
    management of wastewater<strong>. </strong>In the present study Soil Aquifer Treatment
    System is adopted for wastewater reclamation for potable and non-potable uses.
    Textile Mill wastewater was used for experimentation to assess the treatment efficiency
    of SAT system in treating these wastewaters under varied experimental conditions<em>.
    </em>Clayey sand and silty sand are the two soils used for experimentation along
    with the Peepal leaf and Almond leaf has the adsorbents. Removal efficiency of
    chloride BOD and COD was maximum in clayey sand in conjunction with peepal leaf
    has adsorbent. Where in  Colour and TDS removal was maximum in clayey sand when
    compared to silty soil and soils in conjunction with adsorbents.
