  title: Relation between Soil Salinity and Productivity of the Agricultural Plants
  abstract: In the conditions of Shirvan steppe the influence of soil salinity on
    the cotton productivity was studied. It was determined that the cotton growth
    shortens, the size and weight of the cotton-bolls decrease, and the productivity
    reduces when the salt quantity in the soils increases. Accounting the influence
    of the salt quantity and salt composition on the productivity of the agricultural
    plants a new classification was offered for the soils of sulphatic type of salinity.
