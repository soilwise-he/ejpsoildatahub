  title: 'Fresh Biofertilizer: A Novel Concept in Improving Soil Fertility'
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>Biofertilizers\
    \ are gaining tremendous importance in agriculture due to the detrimental effect\
    \ of chemical fertilizers on plants and soil health. It consists of living beneficial\
    \ microorganisms that enhance plant growth and maintain soil health by using different\
    \ mechanisms. For improving the soil health along with the growth of plants Efficiency\
    \ of biofertilizers depends upon different factors such as quality and formulation\
    \ of inoculant, total number of living microbes, and shelf life. .Therefore it\
    \ is very important to discuss the shelf life of biofertilizers and another alternative\
    \ such as use of fresh biofertilizers. Fresh biofertilizers is a concept that\
    \ emphasises immediate use of biofertilizer after production to ensure maximum\
    \ microbial count and hence is a revolutionary idea in the field of agriculture.\
    \ So this study shows the importance of fresh biofertilizer in improving soil\
    \ health and plant growth.</em>"
