  title: Analysis of Biopolymer Remediated Contaminated Soil
  abstract: Soil contamination is emerging as a major threat to environment as well
    as human health. The major causes of contamination are due to the rapid growth
    in industrial development, intensive agriculture and anthropogenic activities
    releasing heavy metals, chemicals, salts and other disease causing agents. The
    heavy metals decreases the quality of soil by leaching into it and thereby causing
    groundwater contamination. Therefore, remediation of such soils is necessary.
    Various methods are employed to remove the contaminants from soil. The paper focuses
    on using biopolymers as remedial agent in cadmium contaminated soil. Biopolymers
    are the polymeric molecules that are harmless and eco-friendly which occurs in
    nature. In the present study, starch based and cellulose based biopolymers were
    used to remediate clayey soil which is artificially contaminated using cadmium
    chloride at different concentrations. The effectiveness of treatment and a comparative
    study upon addition of both biopolymers will be evaluated by means of atterberg
    limits, column leaching test, strength characteristics and micro structural analysis.
