  title: Mineralogical Characterization And Petrographic Classification Of The Soil
    Of Casablanca City
  abstract: The treatment of the geotechnical database of the region of Casablanca
    was difficult to achieve due to the heterogeneity of the nomenclature of the lithological
    formations composing its soil. It appears necessary to harmonize the nomenclature
    of the facies and to produce cartographic documents useful for construction projects
    and studies before any investment program. To achieve this, more than 600 surveys
    made by the Public Laboratory for Testing and Studies (LPEE) in the agglomeration
    of Casablanca, were studied. Moreover, some local observations were made in different
    places of the metropolis. Each survey was the subject of a sheet containing lithological
    succession, macro and microscopic description of petrographic facies with photographic
    illustration, as well as measurements of geomechanical tests. In addition, an
    X-ray diffraction analysis was made in order to characterize the surficial formations
    of the region.
