  title: Effects of GGBS and Fly Ash in Binders on Soil Stabilization for Road Construction
  abstract: In this paper we propose a new technique of soil stabilization for road
    construction based on using new alternative binders. The project aims to evaluate
    the effects of alternative additive materials in soil stabilization contexts for
    road construction. The alternative binders (slag, energy ash and bio ash as new
    alternative road construction material) have been used to complement the traditional
    binders (cement and lime). The project used five binders and evaluated their effects
    on soil strength. The proposed method comprises advantages of using the alternative
    binders which are the residual products contributing to a lower environmental
    impact. The results have shown that only slag has significant effects on the strength
    of the stabilized soil, while bio ash and energy ash make a marginal contribution
    to the increase of strength. This is caused by the twofold reasons. First, the
    effects of the amount of ashes that should reach a certain threshold with respect
    to the total amount of binder that must be exceeded to have the effect of the
    soil mixture. Second, the bio fly ash was stored and it was not completely fresh
    which may have contributed to the carbonation during the storage period and results
    in a lower hardening ability. Based on the results of the study we recommend the
    use of bio fly ash as a supply material andfor its amount to be adjusted so the
    storage period is not too long. This study verified the effects of slag, cement
    and lime on stabilization of soil for road construction.
