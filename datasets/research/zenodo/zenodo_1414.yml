  title: INTERACTION OF SOIL-CEMENT PILE SUPPORTING STRUCTURES WITH THE BODY OF A
    LANDSLIDE
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Analysis and comparison
    of the landslide slope finite element model calculation results of the appliance
    of soil-cement piles, depending on the variation of the retaining structure rigidity,
    makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of their application and the cooperative
    work of piles with the displacement body. It also makes it possible to make a
    conclusion about the advantages of using this anti-landslide protection method
    of the slope.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Analysis of
    geomorphological data obtained from the results of laboratory studies of soils
    on the slope section is considered. Creation of a three-dimensional finite-element
    slope model according to the constructed sections and depths of the soil layers.
    Calculation of the nonlinear problem of finite element modeling of the slope with
    applying of soil-cement piles of various rigidity.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Findings.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The
    obtained results of calculating the finite element model of the landslide slope,
    and the analysis of the stress-strain state of the construction with soil-cement
    piles has been carried out.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Originality.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Despite
    the widespread of using soil-cement piles as enclosing structures for the construction
    of foundation pits and reinforcement of foundations of emergency structures, special
    attention should be paid to the study of the expediency of using soil-cement retaining
    pile structures on landslide areas.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Practical value.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;It
    is known that soil-cement retaining piles are expediently in use as a protective
    element, which interacts quite well with the ground environment due to its structure
    of the initial material. Using of modern computer programs of finite element modeling
    makes it possible to calculate the efficiency of the use of soil-cement piles
    and to determine the parameters of the necessary retaining structure according
    to the given geological structure of the slope, and also, depending on its shape
    and the physical characteristics of the soils, to compare the performance of different
    protective landslide structures types.&lt;/p&gt;'
