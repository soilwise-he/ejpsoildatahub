  title: Soil Stabilization by Using Lime and Fly Ash
  abstract: 'For any type of structure, the foundation is very important and it has
    to be strong to support the entire structure. In order for the strong foundation,
    the soil around it plays a very critical role. To work on soils, we need to have
    proper knowledge about their properties and factors which affect their behaviour.
    By consolidating under load and changing volumetrically along with seasonal moisture
    variation, these problems are manifested through swelling, shrinkage and unequal
    settlement. In this paper the experimental results obtained in the laboratory
    on expansive soils treated with industrial waste fly ash and lime are presented.
    A study is carried out to check the improvements in the properties of expansive
    soil with fly ash and lime in varying percentages. The test results such as liquid
    limit, standard proctor and differential free swelling test obtained on expansive
    clays mixed at different proportions of lime and fly ash admixture are presented
    and discussed in this paper. The results show that the stabilized clay has lesser
    swelling potential whereas an increase in optimum moisture content has been observed.
