  title: Leaching Of Mineral Nitrogen And Phosphate From Rhizosphere Soil Stressed
    By Drought And Intensive Rainfall
  abstract: This work presents the first results from the long-term experiment, which
    is focused on the impact of intensive rainfall and long period of drought on microbial
    activities in soil. Fifteen lysimeters were prepared in the area of our interest.
    This area is a protection zone of underground source of drinking water. These
    lysimeters were filed with topsoil and subsoil collected in this area and divided
    into two groups. These groups differ in fertilization and amount of water received
    during the growing season. Amount of microbial biomass and leaching of mineral
    nitrogen and phosphates were chosen as main indicators of microbial activities
    in soil. Content of mineral nitrogen and phosphates was measured in soil solution,
    which was collected from each lysimeters. Amount of microbial biomass was determined
    in soil samples that were taken from the lysimeters before and after the long
    period of drought and intensive rainfall.
