  title: Influence of different agricultural management practices on soil microbial
    community over dissipation time of two herbicides
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil microbiology could be affected by the presence of pesticide\
    \ residues during intensive farming, potentially threatening the soil environment.\
    \ The aim here was to assess the dissipation of the herbicides triasulfuron and\
    \ prosulfocarb, applied as a combined commercial formulation, and the changes\
    \ in soil microbial communities (through the profile of phospholipid fatty acids\
    \ (PLFAs) extracted from the soil) during the dissipation time of the herbicides\
    \ under field conditions. The dissipation of herbicides and the soil microbial\
    \ structure were assessed under different agricultural practices, such as the\
    \ repeated application of herbicides (twice), in unamended and amended soils with\
    \ two organic amendments derived from green compost (GC1 and GC2) and with non-irrigation\
    \ and irrigation regimes. The results obtained indicate slower dissipation for\
    \ triasulfuron than for prosulfocarb. The 50% dissipation time (DT50) decreased\
    \ under all conditions for the second application of triasulfuron, although not\
    \ for prosulfocarb. The DT50 values for both herbicides increased in the GC2 amended\
    \ soil with the highest organic carbon (OC) content. The DT50 values decreased\
    \ for prosulfocarb with irrigation, but not for triasulfuron, despite its higher\
    \ water solubility. The herbicides did not have any significant effects on the\
    \ relative population of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria during the assay,\
    \ but the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in all the soils with\
    \ herbicides. At the end of the assay (215\u202Fdays), the negative effects of\
    \ herbicides on fungi abundance were significant (p\u202F&lt;\u202F0.05) for all\
    \ the treatments. These microbiological changes were detected in non-irrigated\
    \ and irrigated soils, and were more noticeable after the second application of\
    \ herbicides. Actinobacteria could be responsible for the modification of herbicide\
    \ degradation rates, which tend to be faster after the second application. This\
    \ study makes a useful contribution to the evaluation of the soil environment\
    \ and microbiological risks due to the long-term repeated application of herbicides\
    \ under different agricultural management practices&lt;/p&gt;"
