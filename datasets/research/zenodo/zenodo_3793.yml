  title: Evaluating of Bearing Capacity of Two Adjacent Strip Foundations Located
    around a Soil Slip
  abstract: Selection of soil bearing capacity is an important issue that should be
    investigated under different conditions. The bearing capacity of foundation around
    of soil slope is based on the active and passive forces. On the other hand, due
    to extension of urban structures, it is inevitable to put the foundations together.
    Concerning the two cases mentioned above, investigating the behavior of adjacent
    foundations which are constructed besides soil slope is essential. It should be
    noted that, according to the conditions, the bearing capacity of adjacent foundations
    can be less or more than mat foundations. Also, soil reinforcement increases the
    bearing capacity of adjacent foundations, and the amount of its increase depends
    on the distance between foundations. In this research, based on numerical studies,
    a method is presented for evaluating ultimate bearing capacity of adjacent foundations
    at different intervals. In the present study, the effect of foundation width,
    the center to center distance of adjacent foundations and reinforced soil has
    been investigated on the bearing capacity of adjacent foundations beside soil
    slope. The results indicate that, due to interference of failure surfaces created
    under foundation, it depends on their intervals and the ultimate bearing capacity
    of foundation varies.
