  title: Disentangling drought and nutrient effects on soil carbon dioxide and methane
    fluxes in a tropical forest
  abstract: "Tropical soils are a major contributor to the balance of greenhouse gas\
    \ (GHG) fluxes in the atmosphere. Models of tropical GHG fluxes predict that both\
    \ the frequency of drought events and changes in atmospheric deposition of nitrogen\
    \ (N) will significantly affect dynamics of soil carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)\
    \ and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) production and consumption. In this study, we examined\
    \ the combined effect of a reduction in precipitation and an increase in nutrient\
    \ availability on soil CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in a primary French\
    \ Guiana tropical forest. Drought conditions were simulated by intercepting precipitation\
    \ falling through the forest canopy with tarpaulin roofs. Nutrient availability\
    \ was manipulated through application of granular N and / or phosphorus (P) fertilizer\
    \ to the soil. Soil water content (SWC) below the roofs decreased rapidly and\
    \ stayed at continuously low values until roof removal, which as a consequence\
    \ roughly doubled the duration of the dry season. After roof removal, SWC slowly\
    \ increased but remained lower than in the control soils even after 2.5 months\
    \ of wet-season precipitation. We showed that drought-imposed reduction in SWC\
    \ decreased the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e CO<sub>2</sub> efflux), but strongly\
    \ increased the CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. N, P and N \xD7 P (i.e. NP) additions\
    \ all significantly increased CO<sub>2</sub> emission but had no effect on CH<sub>4</sub>\
    \ fluxes. In treatments where both fertilization and drought were applied, the\
    \ positive effect of N, P and NP fertilization on CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was reduced.\
    \ After roof removal, soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was more resilient in the control\
    \ plots than in the fertilized plots while there was only a modest effect of roof\
    \ removal on soil CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes. Our results suggest that a combined increase\
    \ in drought and nutrient availability in soil can locally increase the emissions\
    \ of both CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4</sub> from tropical soils, for a long term."
