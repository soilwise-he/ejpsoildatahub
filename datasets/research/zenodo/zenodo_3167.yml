  title: Ultrasonic P- and S-Wave Reflection and CPT Soundings for Measuring Shear
    Strength in Soil Stabilized by Deep Lime/Cement Columns in Stockholm Norvik Port
  abstract: In this research project, the measurements of the ultrasonic P- and S-waves
    and seismic cone penetration testing (CPT) were applied to identify subsurface
    conditions and properties of clayey soil stabilized with lime/cement columns in
    the Stockholm Norvik Port, Sweden. Applied geophysical methods enabled to identify
    a connection between the resistance of soil and strength in the stabilized columns.
    The records of the seismic tests were obtained in the laboratory of Swedish Geotechnical
    Institute (SGI) through estimated P- and S-wave velocities using techniques of
    resonance frequency measurement of the stabilized specimens. The CPT profiles
    were used to evaluate the quality of the lime/cement columns of the reinforced
    soil by the interpretation of signals. The relationship between the P- and S-waves
    demonstrated a gain in strength during soil hardening. The quality of soil was
    evaluated by seismic measurements with aim to achieve sufficient strength of foundations
    prior to the construction of the infrastructure objects and industrial works.
    Seismic CPT is an effective method essential to evaluate the correct placement
    of the CPT inside the column. This work demonstrated the alternative seismic methods
    supporting the up-hole technology of drilling techniques for practical purpose
    in civil engineering and geotechnical works.
