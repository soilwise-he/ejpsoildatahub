  title: Biodiversity of soil fungal communities in agro-ecosystems using DNA metabarcoding
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil fungi are key component of soil biota having an important\
    \ role in many ecological processes. As pathogens, decomposers and plant mutualists\
    \ they can affect plant and soil health in agro-ecosystems significantly. The\
    \ impact of crop management practices on soil fungal communities is diverse and\
    \ still poorly studied. The lack of knowledge is mainly related to their hidden\
    \ life mode, high phenotypic diversity, the great heterogeneity of soil microhabitats,\
    \ difficulty for culturing and species identification. Collecting data with high\
    \ accuracy to detect effects relevant to ecosystem management\_is an ongoing challenge\
    \ for soil ecological studies and biomonitoring. However, the combination of DNA-based\
    \ identification methods and Next Generation Sequencing technology was recognized\
    \ as a powerful tool to evaluate biodiversity in environmental samples, especially\
    \ soil biodiversity. In the frame of the National Research Program \"Healthy Foods\
    \ for a Strong Bio-Economy and Quality of Life\", soil microbiome diversity (fungi,\
    \ prokaryotes and archaea) will be used as indicator for assessing soil and plant\
    \ health, and ecosystem services in several agricultural ecosystems. Four crop\
    \ types (apple, lavender, rose and pea) located in southern Bulgaria, and managed\
    \ by conventional and organic farming have been selected. Two general objectives\
    \ related to soil biodiversity study were envisaged:&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n    to examine\
    \ the impact of cropping systems on microbiome structural and functional diversity,\
    \ and\n    to propose management measures and agronomic practices improving soil\
    \ and plant health.\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;Here we present some preliminary results on\
    \ soil fungal communities evaluated by using amplicon DNA sequencing of the internal\
    \ transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA region. Multiple core soil samples were collected\
    \ from 18 sampling plots in June 2019. Fungal diversity and community structure\
    \ were evaluated at different taxonomic levels. The most common and abundant taxa\
    \ at all sites were &lt;em&gt;Fusarium\_&lt;/em&gt;Link\_1809, &lt;em&gt;Solicoccozyma\_\
    &lt;/em&gt;X.Z.Liu, F.Y.Bai, M.Groenew. &amp; Boekhout\_2015, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium\
    \ &lt;/em&gt;Link 1816, &lt;em&gt;Alternaria&lt;/em&gt; Nees ex Wallroth 1816,\
    \ and &lt;em&gt;Mortierella\_&lt;/em&gt;E.Coemans\_1863.\_The multivariate statistics\
    \ (PCA) comparing the overall microbial composition revealed loose clusters linked\
    \ to crops and localities. The study provides a new comprehensive overview of\
    \ soil fungal communities (composition and diversity) from Bulgarian agro-ecosystems\
    \ using high-throughput DNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;"
