  title: Improvement in Geotechnical Properties of Expansive Soil using Different
    Grain Size of Bagasse Ash, Lime and Quarry Dust
  abstract: The time period soil stabilization method improving the engineering houses
    of soil by means of synthetic method and increasing the solidity or bearing ability
    of any sort of soil via the use of managed proportioning, its compaction and the
    addition of a stabilizing agent. In soil stabilization, one of a kind methods
    are used to modify and enhance the houses of a soil so that it can be stabilized.
    The cost of creation of the pavement is considerably decreases if domestically
    to be had low cost substances are used in the production of sub base, sub grade
    and so on. The design of pavement is based on the minimum specified structural
    strength and bearing quality of the soil that will be achieved for each and every
    layer of material. This study investigated the stabilization of black cotton soil
    when stabilized by bagasse ash, lime and combination of different grain size of
    bagasse ash, lime and quarry dust. In this research various laboratory tests like
    atterberg limits, proctor test and CBR i.e California bearing ratio test is performed.California
    Bearing Ratio of the soil increases with the increase of Grain size of Bagasse
    ash.
