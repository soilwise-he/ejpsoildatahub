  title: Long-term soil water content dynamics under different land uses in a small
    agricultural catchment
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Longer term monitoring of soil water content at a catchment\
    \ scale is a key to understanding its dynamics,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;which can assist\
    \ stakeholders in decision making processes, such as land use change or irrigation\
    \ programs. Soil water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;monitoring in agriculturally dominated\
    \ catchments can help in developing soil water retention measurements, for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;assessment\
    \ of land use change, or adaptation of specific land management systems to climate\
    \ change. The present study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;was carried out in the Pannonian\
    \ region (Upper-Balaton, Hungary) on Cambisols and Calcisols between 2015 and\
    \ 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soil water content (SWC) dynamics were investigated\
    \ under different land use types (vineyard, grassland, and forest) at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;three\
    \ depths (15, 40, and 70 cm). The meteorological data show a continuous decrease\
    \ in cumulative precipitation over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;time during the study with\
    \ an average of 26% decrease observed between 2016 and 2020, while average air\
    \ temperatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;were similar for all the studied years. Corresponding\
    \ to the lower precipitation amounts, a clear decrease in the average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWC\
    \ was observed at all the land use sites, with 13.4%, 37.7%, and 29.3% lower average\
    \ SWC for the grassland, forest,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and vineyard sites, respectively,\
    \ from 2016 to 2020 (measured at the 15 cm depth of the soil). Significant differences\
    \ in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWC were observed between the annual and seasonal numbers\
    \ within a given land use (p &lt; 0.05). The lowest average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWC\
    \ was observed at the grassland (11.7%) and the highest at the vineyard (28.3%).\
    \ The data showed an increasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;average soil temperature, with\
    \ an average 6.3% higher value in 2020 compared to 2016. The grassland showed\
    \ the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;highest (11.3 \xB0C) and the forest soil the lowest (9.7\
    \ \xB0C) average soil temperatures during the monitoring period. The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;grassland\
    \ had the highest number of days with the SWC below the wilting point, while the\
    \ forest had the highest number&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of days with the SWC optimal\
    \ for the plants.&lt;/p&gt;"
