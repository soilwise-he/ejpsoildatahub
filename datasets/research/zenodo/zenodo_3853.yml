  title: Mulching effects on soil microbial, physicochemical properties and performance
    of cowpea on coastal plain sand
  abstract: 'The presence of residue mulches in farm has been known to effectively
    save the soil surface, prevent soil erosion on slopes, helps reduce soil moisture
    loss through evaporation, and insulates soil, protect roots from extreme temperatures,
    improve soil biology, aeration, aggregation of soil particles and reduce drainage
    over time, improve soil fertility as certain mulch types decompose, inhibits certain
    plant diseases, reduces the likelihood of tree damage from "weed whackers" or
    the dreaded "lawn mower blight", give planting beds a uniform and provide favorable
    preservation of ecological stability. This experiment was conducted in the Teaching
    and Research Farm of Akwa Ibom State University, Obio Akpa Campus to assess the
    effect of sawdust, pulverized palm bunch and <em>Calopogonium mucunoides</em>
    leaves<strong> </strong>mulches effects on soil microbial, physicochemical properties
    and performance of white dwarf cowpea (<em>Vigna unguiculata</em>) on coastal
    plain sand of Southern Nigeria. Results showed that soil mulched with <em>Calopogonium
    mucunoides</em> leaves<em> </em>recorded the highest in the following parameters
    measured: pH of 6.45, organic carbon (5.16%), nitrogen (2.26%), ECEC of 11.35
    cmol, available phosphorus of 323 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, base saturation (91.11%),
    100% seed emergence and leaf area. The highest moisture content of 35% was obtained
    in the sawdust mulched soil. The highest peas moisture content (5.63%), crude
    fiber (3.91), lipid (4.71), total ash (4.82) and carbohydrates (61.88%) were obtained
    in the soil mulched with<em> Calopogonium mucunoides </em>while highest bacterial
    counts of 37x10<sup>5</sup> cfu g<sup>-1</sup> soil and the fungi counts (51x10<sup>3</sup>
    cfu g<sup>-1</sup> soil). The studied soil contained more than 70% sand. The soil
    is described as sandy loam which gives rise to Typic Paludult, characteristics
    of soil derived from coastal plain sand.'
