  title: Extraction Refinement Oily of Soil and Microbe Decomposition of Hydrocorbons
  abstract: With the purpose of improving the physical substances of oily soil, rehabilitation
    of its ability to reproduce the biomass and improving the soil ecology, the conduction
    of a two - stage recovery arrangements is tasted. During the first stage, the
    major part of the oil pollutant (97-99 %) is extracted from the soil by means
    of organic solvent and water as a process of extract ional refinement, and complete
    refinement of the soil by means of microbe decomposition is carried out on the
    second stage.
