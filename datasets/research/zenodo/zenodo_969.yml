  title: An Estimation of Soil Erosion in Gandamanur Watershed Using Geospatial Technology
  abstract: Soil erosion is one of the critical environmental problems and a major
    threat to many natural resources. Stream bank erosion is a kind of water erosion,
    in which soil is removed by the runoff flowing over the sides of the stream coming
    from the areas or by undercutting of soil below the water surface from the stream
    section. Quantitative analysis of soil loss and description of erosion prone areas
    are essential for conservation programme. The present study focuses on estimation
    of soil erosion in Gandamanur watershed of Theni District. The soil loss values
    estimated for Gandamanur watershed ranges from 0 to 219.7 ton/ hec /yr with an
    average of 2.53 t/ha/yr (metric ton per hectare per year). High soil erosion found
    in steep slopes and streams. Integrated Remote sensing and GIS technology is applied
    for prepare various thematic layers of Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE)
    which is used to estimate the soil erosion at watershed level.
