  title: Numerical Investigation On Damage Evolution Of Piles Inside Liquefied Soil
    Foundation - Dynamic-Loading Experiments -
  abstract: 'The large and small-scale shaking table tests, which

    was conducted for investigating damage evolution of piles inside

    liquefied soil, are numerically simulated and experimental verified by the3D nonlinear
    finite element analysis. Damage evolution of

    elasto-plastic circular steel piles and reinforced concrete (RC) one with cracking
    and yield of reinforcement are focused on, and the failure patterns and residual
    damages are captured by the proposed constitutive models. The superstructure excitation
    behind quay wall is

    reproduced as well.'
