  title: Soil resistance of steel pipe piles during vibratory hammer installation
  abstract: "In this paper, we attempted to evaluate the soil resistance during the\
    \ installation and the bearing capacity after curing<br> time of the steel pipe\
    \ piles by vibratory hammer installation. Four steel pipe piles with diameter\
    \ of 114.3mm and length<br> of 11m were constructed for the test. Three piles\
    \ were installed by a vibratory hammer with different penetration rates.<br> One\
    \ pile was installed by a drop hammer. Dynamic measurement with axial pile head\
    \ strain and acceleration were<br> performed during installation. As the calculation\
    \ method of the soil resistance for vibratory hammer installation, we<br> adopted\
    \ two methods, the single-mass model analysis method and the CASE method (Rausche\
    \ et al., 1985) based on<br> the one-dimensional wave theory. We attempted to\
    \ separate the soil resistance into the shaft and the toe from the shape<br> of\
    \ the soil resistance \u2013 displacement curve. Static load tests were performed\
    \ on all test piles with curing time of 1 day,<br> 28 days and 180 days after\
    \ installation."
