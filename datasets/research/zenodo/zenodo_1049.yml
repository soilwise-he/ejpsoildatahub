  title: Pasture, tree and soil evolution in silvopastoral systems of Atlantic Europe
  abstract: "Increased forest area and wood production is a key goal for the European\
    \ Union, together with avoidance of hazards that damage forests. Galicia is a\
    \ region of northwest Spain that belongs to the Atlantic biogeographic region\
    \ with very high wood production, but due to climate fire has a major negative\
    \ impact on forest productivity (i.e. it represents 16% of the fires of Europe).\
    \ Silvopastoral systems offer the potential to enhance forest productivity as\
    \ well as to obtain income from newly afforested areas in the short term. Herbaceous\
    \ pasture production within such systems can be optimized through species selection\
    \ and through fertilization. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effect\
    \ of three types of fertilization on two sward mixtures established under Pinus\
    \ radiata D. Don cover on abandoned agricultural land over an initial period of\
    \ 7 years. Tree and pasture growth were enhanced with organic fertilization, tree\
    \ growth rate not being limited by summer drought, and compared with mineral treatment,\
    \ trees\ngrowing up on sludge treatment had around 35 and 30% more height and\
    \ diameter, \nespectively. Acidity tendency of Galician soils was reduced with\
    \ mineral treatment. Soil pH was positively affected by mineral fertilization\
    \ as it was reduced in less extent in this treatment (pH 6) than in organic (pH\
    \ 5.3) or no fertilization treatment (pH 5.6), as crop cation extractions were\
    \ reduced. The proportion of Na and Mg in the effective CEC was higher in fertilization\
    \ with dairy sludge and no fertilization plots due to better tree canopy development.\
    \ The interchangeable potassium content in ryegrass sown plots was reduced when\
    \ no fertilization was applied due to dicot extractions, which can explain lower\
    \ tree growth than in non-fertilized cocksfoot plots. Correct tree and pasture\
    \ management, using appropriate sowing mixtures and fertilization types, makes\
    \ it possible to improve the productivity of both components of the silvopastoral\
    \ system. Our present results indicate that it is better to use organic fertilizers\
    \ in the establishment of cocksfoot or ryegrass on sandy soils for tree and pasture\
    \ growth enhancement."
