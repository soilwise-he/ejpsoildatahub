  title: COMPARISON OF DESIGN OF MULTI-RISERS USING STIFFNESS MATRIX METHOD AND CONTINUUM
    METHOD FOR THE STUDY OF SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION EFFECTS
  abstract: "The most common Superstructure modelling procedure is the fixed base\
    \ approach which assumes infinite stiffness at the foundation \u2013soil interface.\
    \ The above assumption is valid only for light structures on very stiff, rocky\
    \ strata. It is seen that the relative stiffness between the superstructure &amp;\
    \ foundation is the major influencing factor. The current codes do not specify\
    \ the provision of Soil-Structure-Interaction effects on the super structure modelling.\
    \ Literature study showed a large number of case studies of the soil structure\
    \ interaction effects on the low rise buildings. The S.S.I effect for the low\
    \ rise buildings is considered to be moresevere because of the height as it results\
    \ in much smaller time period which generally falls in the linearly increasing\
    \ range in the response spectrum given in IS 1893(Part 1).The linear range gives\
    \ a higher value of the seismic base shear due to increased period on account\
    \ of consideration of flexibility of soils. Also the earthquake forces are the\
    \ predominant dynamic load case for low to medium rise buildings.In the present\
    \ study, the performance of a set of multi \u2013risers with similar plan, geometric\
    \ configuration and material properties with variable heights is checked considering\
    \ the soil structure interaction model with respect to the fixed base model. The\
    \ assessment of the variation in design due to the soil structure interaction\
    \ effect is done. For the purpose, the study of various soil structure models\
    \ was done and the pros and cons of each model were studied and a comparative\
    \ assessment was done to find the best suitable model for the problem in consideration.\
    \ The IS code specifications for the dynamic load case analysis of structures\
    \ were studied to know the assumptions made for the dynamic analysis of structures\
    \ and also select the best soil structure model. The most common dynamic load\
    \ analysis methods for the R.C.C buildings are the equivalent lateral force method\
    \ and the response spectrum method for the seismic forces and the wind load analysis\
    \ is done using the static method of application of wind forces calculated from\
    \ the wind pressure which is dependent on the basic wind speed. Hence the representation\
    \ of soil medium as static springs whose stiffness values are calculated using\
    \ a continuum method where the soil is viewed as a continuum with elastic properties\
    \ and the solution involves rigid body motion equations and the matrix of dynamic\
    \ influence is solved using various methods like Laplace\u2019s transformations,\
    \ Fourier transformations etc.The paper \u201CAnalysis of Machine foundation vibrations\u201D\
    \ by George Gazetas has given the various soil models and the different methodologies\
    \ used in the solutions which was used as reference to compute the spring stiffness.\
    \ The fixed base analysis was done and an appropriate foundation was arrived at.The\
    \ direct method of the interaction study in which the soil element represented\
    \ as static springs using continuum are applied to the structure and the assessment\
    \ of variation in results are done. The analysis of multi-risers is usually done\
    \ by assuming a fixed base as in most cases the foundation is taken to rest on\
    \ rocky soils. The changes in design results due the assignment of soil springs\
    \ are analyzed in the present study."
