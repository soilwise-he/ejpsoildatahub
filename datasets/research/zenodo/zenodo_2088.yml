  title: Soil organic Carbon Stock affected by different cropping system of Prayagraj
    District, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> Cropping system is an\
    \ effective agricultural practice which play crucial role in soil carbon stabilization,\
    \ soil health and fertility as well as in sequestering atmospheric CO<sub>2 </sub>in\
    \ soil for long period of time. With these considerations in mind, a research\
    \ was conducted in the Prayagraj district of eastern Uttar Pradesh to evaluate\
    \ how major agricultural systems affect soil carbon stock. The major cropping\
    \ system includes Wheat-Wheat, Mustard- Mustard, Rice-Wheat and Rice-Mustard Soil\
    \ samples were collected from eight tehsil of Prayagraj district randomly from\
    \ depth 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth. The findings show that soil organic carbon\
    \ store in rice-wheat cropping systems is higher than in other cropping systems."
