  title: Nitrogen Fixation in Slightly Alkaline Soil in Presence of Calcium Salts
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-2 <em>Manuscript
    received 3 February 1972; accepted 12 January 1973</em> The effectiveness of eight
    calcium salts viz., calcium carbonate, di-calcium phosphate, calcium oxide, calcium
    sulphate, calcium sulphite, calcium sulphide, calcium acetate and calcium citrate
    on nitrogen fixation in a slightly alkaline soil was observed. It was found that
    the calcium salts, in general, enhance the nitrogen status of soil, the extent
    being dependent on the presence or absence of soil moisture, time and the nature
    of anionic parts of the calcium salts added.
