  title: Soil Test Based Phosphorous Calibration for Fababean (Vicia faba L.) Production
    on Nitisols in Central Highlands of Ethiopian
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil test based phosphorous calibration study was conducted
    fababean on Nitisols of farmers&rsquo; fields in West Shewa, in central highlands
    of Ethiopia. The experiment was arranged in a complete block design with six levels
    of phosphorous fertilizer (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    with three replications. Results showed that grain yield of fababean were significantly
    affected by P fertilizer application rate. The application of phosphorous fertilizer
    at different rates increased grain yield, up to 58% more than the control. Extractable
    soil P concentrations (Bray II, 0- 20 cm depth) three weeks after planting significantly
    responded to P fertilizer rate. Correlations of relative yield with Bray-2 soil
    test phosphorous values showed that the soil test phosphorous levels greater than
    12.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;(critical phosphorous concentration)
    was found to be sufficient for fababean production. The average phosphorous requirement
    factor (Pf)&lt;sup&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;calculated from soil test phosphorous
    values of all treatments for the study area was 7.02&lt;/p&gt;'
