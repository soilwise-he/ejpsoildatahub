  title: 'Physiological and biochemical parameters of soil-plant system under allelopathic
    stress: Diagnostic analysis and control'
  abstract: The diagnostic analysis of functional state of the soil-plant system under
    allelopathic stress has been carried out for its optimization. For this purpose,
    it has been used a number of physiological and biochemical parameters. The influence
    of winter rape biomass (<em>Brassica campestris </em>L. f. <em>biennis </em>D.C.)
    as green manure on allelopathic, biochemical and physiological properties of the
    soil-plant system on an example of perennial plantings of lilac cultivars (<em>Syringa
    vulgaris</em> L.) of the M.M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden of the NAS of
    Ukraine collection was studied. Green biomass of winter rape during flowering
    stage was added into grey forest soil at 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> on mentioned areas
    of the arboretum. It was established that the application of winter rape biomass
    as green manure significantly improved the functional state of the soil-plant
    system under long-term cultivation of lilac plants. Structural components of the
    soil-plant system stabilized under the influence of green manure biomass decay
    products, which positively affected both allelopathic and biochemical soil properties
    and the physiological state of the lilac plants. There have been qualitative dynamic
    changes in soil-plant system for the green manure action, which manifested stimulation
    of growth processes, intensification of humification (by the phenolic acids pool),
    improving the redox regime, restructuring of component composition of photosynthetic
    pigments, and eventually increase in adaptive ability of lilac plants. As this
    trend persisted not only for the direct action of this factor, but also in its
    after-effect (next growing season after application of green manure biomass) can
    recommend the use of winter rape as green manure for optimization of soil-plant
    system under allelopathic stress.
