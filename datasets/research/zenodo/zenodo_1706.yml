  title: Comparative Evaluation Of The Effects Of Soil And Fertilizer Treatment On
    Winter Wheat Cultivation
  abstract: Resource-saving technologies in soil cultivation are one of the most promising
    methods of land use, developed in our time. In this experiment, winter wheat was
    studied, the yield of which was directly related to the cultivation of the soil
    and the application of organic and mineral fertilizers. In the complex of agrotechnical
    measures that contribute to obtaining high yields of food grain of winter wheat,
    fertilizers have a leading role. We, skillfully using fertilizers, tried to improve
    the quality of grain, increasing its protein content, gluten content and technological
    properties. The positive effect of fertilizers on plants of winter wheat is manifested
    only in well-cultivated soils with a reaction of the environment close to neutral.
    The article presents the results of research on the influence of soil cultivation
    and fertilizers on the yield of winter wheat in the Ganja-Gazakh region of Azerbaijan.
    The purpose of our research is to study methods of soil and fertilizer cultivation,
    improvement of soil fertility and winter wheat cultivation technology, which ensures
    higher yield and quality of grain in the Ganja-Gazakh zone of Azerbaijan. On the
    basis of these studies found that to obtain a high yield and quality of winter
    wheat and soil fertility restoration of the grain on a grey-brown long-irrigated
    soils of this area, we recommend the traditional farms (loosening of 20-22 cm)
    and minimum tillage, using fertilizer annually normal manure 10t/ha+N90P90K60.
    As a result, production of the two recommended treatments and soil cultivation
    rate of fertilizer, except in 3 years minimum processing necessary to replace
    traditionally.
