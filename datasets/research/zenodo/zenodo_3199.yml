  title: High Soil Erosion Potential Areas and Their Prioritization for Rehabilitation
    using a Modified Relative Erosion Potential Index In the Upper Bued River Watershed,
    Tuba, Benguet, Philippines.
  abstract: Evaluation of Soil Erosion Potential Measures indicates the suitability
    of using a rescaled Relative Erosion Potential Index (over USLE, RUSLE and MUSLE)
    in the Upper Blue River Watershed. 500 x 500m cell raster coding of average slope
    (in %, from quadrant search), land cover, and porosity (derived from soil type)
    enabled simple multiplication of average rainfall of the rainiest month, average
    slope, WRI-supplied values for soil type and land cover/use which gives rise to
    the Relative Erosion Potential (REP) index. Rescaling (from 0 to 1 for minimum
    and maximum) of the REP index facilitated statistical classification of the rescaled
    REP cell scores, resulting in the identification of 12 areas warranting priority
    work for rehabilitation. These 12 areas are marked by steep to very steep slopes
    (all &gt;50%), grassland cover, and are dominated by porous soil types. Six of
    these areas, in order of priority, are within the watershed, namely Camp 6, NE
    Camp 5, SE PMA, NW Camp 4, East Camp 3, and NE Sto. Tomas areas. The other six
    areas lie outside of the watershed; Philex North, Philex Minesite, NW Sto. Tomas,
    Banget are mostly within the Philex mining operations where reforestation is ongoing.
    The Saddle and Acupan Areas are astride the Philex Road. Vegetative measures,
    such as tree species, especially those endemic to the area and suited to high
    elevation, steep slopes, thin, calcareous, lateritic or acidic soils are recommended.
    Vines and creeping plants, including bamboo and rattan which will hold and protect
    the soil from direct rainfall impact, retain moisture, provide organic matter,
    retard runoff, and provide products for domestic consumption and commercial use
    are also recommended. Simple engineering measures at smaller scales for runoff
    control such as check damns, wattling, fascines and slope protection such as riprapping
    are recommend if proven to be cost-effective relative to the value of the downstream
    sites to be protected. The methodology, as well as results of this study, can
    be improved with updated land cover data and consideration of soil loss potential
    due to mass movement. Results of this study are recommended to be disseminated
    and discussed with relevant stakeholders to hasten progress in mitigating soil
    loss in the area.<br>
