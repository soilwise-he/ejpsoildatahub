  title: Rhizosphere Effects of Melocanna baccifera on Soil Microbial Properties under
    Different Fallow Phases Following Shifting Cultivation
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Rhizosphere plays an important role in regulating soil fertility\
    \ and nutrient cycling in different ecosystems. Bamboos are important secondary\
    \ successional plants in fallow land that have strong impact on the soil fertility\
    \ of different fallow lands. The main objectives of the present study is to examined\
    \ the rhizosphere effects of bamboo (&lt;em&gt;Melocanna baccifera&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ on soil microbial properties (soil organic carbon, SOC; total nitrogen, TN;\
    \ microbial biomass C and N, MBC and MBN; dehydrogenase activity, DHA; acid phosphatase\
    \ activity, APA; \u03B2-glucosidase activity, GSA) in rhizosphere (RS) and bulk\
    \ soil (BS) in shifting cultivation stand with different fallow phase (2 years\
    \ old, FP-2; 5 years old, FP-5; and 10 years old fallow, FP-10) in Mizoram. The\
    \ result indicated that soil microbial properties were significantly higher (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;0.05)\
    \ in RS compared to BS. Further, the level of microbial properties significantly\
    \ increases in longer fallow (FP-10) compared to shorter fallow (FP-2 and FP-5).\
    \ On contrary, magnitude of rhizosphere effect of &lt;em&gt;M. baccifera&lt;/em&gt;\
    \ was greater in shorter fallow phase compared to longer fallow phase for all\
    \ microbial properties except in APA and GSA. It was concluded that the rhizosphere\
    \ effect of bamboo in shorter fallow is microbial mediated under C and nutrient\
    \ limited conditions and in longer fallow the same is regulated by the accumulated\
    \ organic matter and the available nutrients. Further studies are needed to assess\
    \ the changes in secondary successional plant rhizosphere microbes under different\
    \ fallow phases.&lt;/p&gt;"
