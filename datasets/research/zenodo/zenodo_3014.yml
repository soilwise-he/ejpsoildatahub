  title: Compilation of interactive electronic soil maps and maps of ecological assessment
    of soils of Azerbaijan on the basis of geographic information systems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the GIS software, an electronic map platform
    has been created covering the entire territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan,
    which supports an interactive update mode. This map covers the entire scale of
    the spectrum and meets the requirements of e-agriculture and other public information
    systems, which are based on the use of data space. For conducting soil, agrochemical
    and interdisciplinary research on the platform, a method of plastic relief was
    developed. A detailed methodology for compiling digital soil and ecological soil
    assessment maps using 3D visualization has also been prepared.&lt;/p&gt;'
