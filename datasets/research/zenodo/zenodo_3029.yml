  title: The Role Of Soil Nutrient Availability On The Invasion Establishment And
    Carbon Sequestration Potential Of An Invasive Shrub From Doon Valley, India
  abstract: "Invasive plants are capable of modifying the soil properties to enable\
    \ the further invasion of other plant species. In the present study we assessed\
    \ the relation between soil properties and different growth patterns of Lantana\
    \ (a noxious weedy shrub) and further its role in the atmospheric carbon sequestration\
    \ process from Doon Valley, India. We found that in all the invaded sites the\
    \ pH was increased but the increase in pH value did not show any positive relation\
    \ with the measured and calculated attributes of Lantana like plant height, crown\
    \ diameter, crown length, Phytovolume and biomass. However, this showed that less\
    \ acidic conditions of soil is favouring the invasion of Lantana in all the land\
    \ use systems. On the other side total Nitrogen (%) and Carbon (%) was greatly\
    \ significant in deciding most of the measured and calculated attributes of Lantana.\
    \ Nitrogen (%) was increased in all the invaded sites. The highest Nitrogen (%)\
    \ content was recorded from Sahastradhara, which was from 0.14 (\xB1 .01) to 1.12\
    \ (\xB10.44) followed by Mothronwala swamp which was from 0.17  (\xB1 0.01) to\
    \ 0.1.06 (\xB10.41). Nitrogen % from all the sites showed a strong and significant\
    \ correlation with other calculated attributes of Lantana. Nitrogen % with canopy\
    \ coverage % (R2 = 0.82), Nitrogen % with average crown diameter (R2 = 0.98),\
    \ Nitrogen % with shrub canopy area (R2 = 0.96), Nitrogen % with Phytovolume (R2\
    \ = 0.81) and Nitrogen % with biomass of Lantana/m2 (R2 = 0.92) but Nitrogen %\
    \ with average height of shrub (R2 = 0.57) was not very significant. The SOC (Soil\
    \ Organic Carbon) also showed a strong correlation in determining the different\
    \ measured attributes of Lantana. Carbon % with canopy coverage %  (R2 = 0.85),\
    \ carbon % with average crown diameter (R2 = 0.94), carbon % with shrub canopy\
    \ area (R2 = 0.93), carbon % with phytovolume (R2 = 0.75) and with biomass of\
    \ Lantana/m2                    (R2 = 0.91) but like nitrogen this time carbon\
    \ also did not show a significant correlation with average shrub height (R2 =\
    \ 0.47). The PCA shows that soil parameters like pH, available P and K, represent\
    \ negative correlation with other soil parameters (r = - 0.042 with P, 0.109 with\
    \ K \u2013 0.009 with N and 0.0624 with C). Both available P and K along with\
    \ the C:N ratio were showing negative correlation with other calculated attributes."
