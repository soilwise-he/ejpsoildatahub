  title: Soil Resistivity Cut Off Value And Concrete Pole Deployments In Hv Transmission
    Mains
  abstract: "The prologue of new High Voltage (HV) transmission mains into the community\
    \ necessitates earthing design to ensure safety compliance of the system. Concrete\
    \ poles are widely used within HV transmission mains; many retired transmission\
    \ mains with timber poles are being replaced with concrete ones, green transmission\
    \ mains are deploying concrete poles. The earthing arrangement of the concrete\
    \ poles could have an impact on the earth grid impedance also on the input impedance\
    \ of the system from the fault point of view. This paper endeavors to provide\
    \ information on the soil resistivity of the area and the deployments of concrete\
    \ poles. It introduce the cut off soil resistivity value <em>\u03C1<sub>SC</sub></em>,\
    \ this value aid in determine the impact of deploying the concrete poles on the\
    \ earthing system. Multiple cases were discussed in this paper."
