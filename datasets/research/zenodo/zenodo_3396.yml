  title: Bioremediation of PAHs-Contaminated Soil Using Land Treatment Processes
  abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in crude oil and its
    derivatives contaminate soil and also increase carcinogen and mutagen contamination,
    which is a concern for researchers. Land farming is one of the methods that remove
    pollutants from the soil by native microorganisms. It seems that this technology
    is cost-effective, environmentally friendly and causes less debris problem to
    be disposed. This study aimed to refine the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from
    oil-contaminated soil using the land farming method. In addition to examine the
    concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by GC-FID, some characteristics
    such as soil microbial respiration and dehydrogenase, peroxidase, urease, acid
    and alkaline phosphatase enzyme concentration were also measured. The results
    showed that after land farming process the concentrations of some polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons dropped to 50 percent. The results showed that the enzyme concentration
    is reduced by reducing the concentration of hydrocarbons and microbial respiration.
    These results emphasize the process of land farming for removal of polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons from soil by indigenous microorganisms.
