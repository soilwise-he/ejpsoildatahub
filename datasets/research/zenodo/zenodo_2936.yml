  title: LEVEL OF SOME HEAVY METALS AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN SOIL SAMPLES
    FROM SHANI AND KWAYWKUSAR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS, BORNO STATE, NIGERIA
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nKwayakusar and Shani local government areas are known for\
    \ intensive agricultural activities for both commercial and consumption purposes\
    \ and use tones of agrochemicals for soil amendment to improve harvest. These\
    \ agrochemicals and other sources introduces heavy metals in the soil, hence,\
    \ the need to access the level of some heavy metals and physicochemical parameters\
    \ changes in the soil. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was used to determine\
    \ the concentration of the heavy metals in the soil. Determinations of pH, conductivity,\
    \ cation exchange capacity (CEC) organic carbon, organic matter, calcium, sodium\
    \ and potassium were carried out using standard methods. The pH of the soil from\
    \ the two local government area ranged from 5.74E+00 to 6.54E+00, while electrical\
    \ conductivity varies from 1.90E+01 to 4.11E+02 \xB5Scm-1with the highest concentration\
    \ being observed in the soil from Gashina agricultural location at Kwayakusar\
    \ local government area. The levels of cation exchange capacity ranged from 8.09E+00\
    \ to 6.92E+01 C.mol/kg with the highest concentration also detected in Gashina\
    \ agricultural location from Kwayakusar local government area. Organic carbon\
    \ in the soil samples from the two local governments\u2019 agricultural locations\
    \ ranged from 5.09E-01 to 4.06E+00 %, while organic matter varies from 1.17E+00\
    \ to 7.10E+00 %. The maximum percentage of 4.06E+00 % organic carbon was observed\
    \ in the Gashina agricultural location at Kwayakusar local government area, while\
    \ the minimum percentage of 5.09E-01 % was observed in the soil from Lukundum\
    \ agricultural location in Shani local government area. For organic matter, the\
    \ maximum percentage of 7.00E+00 % was detected in the soil from Gashina agricultural\
    \ location at Kwayakusar local government area, while the minimum percentage of\
    \ 1.17E+00 % was observed in the soil from Lukundum agricultural location at Shani\
    \ local government area. Calcium ranged from 4.60E+00 to 2.10E+01 Mg/Kg; for sodium,\
    \ it ranged from 5.00E-02 to 3.30E-01 Mg/Kg; while potassium ranged from 1.50E-01\
    \ to 2.94 mg/kg.\_ The level of Ca, Na and K in the soil samples from the two\
    \ Local Government agricultural locations increases with increase in depth.Thus,the\
    \ concentrations of heavy metals in the soils samples obtained from the present\
    \ study were higher than the FAO standard.\n\nKeywords: Heavy Metals; Kwayakusar;\
