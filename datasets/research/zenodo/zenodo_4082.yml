  title: Effects Of Irrigation Scheduling And Soil Management On Maize (Zea Mays L.)
    Yield In Guinea Savannah Zone Of Nigeria
  abstract: The main objective of any irrigation program is the development of an
    efficient water management system to sustain crop growth and development and avoid
    physiological water stress in the growing plants. Field experiment to evaluate
    the effects of some soil moisture conservation practices on yield and water use
    efficiency (WUE) of maize was carried out in three locations (i.e. Mubi and Yola
    in the northern Guinea Savannah and Ganye in the southern Guinea Savannah of Adamawa
    State, Nigeria) during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. The experiment consisted
    of three different irrigation levels (7, 10 and 12 day irrigation intervals),
    two levels of mulch (mulch and un-mulched) and two tillage practices (no tillage
    and minimum tillage) arranged in a randomized complete block design with split-split
    plot arrangement and replicated three times. The Blaney-Criddle method was used
    for measuring crop evapotranspiration. The results indicated that seven-day irrigation
    intervals and mulched treatment were found to have significant effect (P&gt;0.05)
    on grain yield and water use efficiency in all the locations. The main effect
    of tillage was non-significant (P&lt;0.05) on grain yield and WUE. The interaction
    effects of irrigation and mulch were significant (P&gt;0.05) on grain yield and
    WUE at Mubi and Yola. Generally, higher grain yield and WUE were recorded on mulched
    and seven-day irrigation intervals, whereas lower values were recorded on un-mulched
    with 12-day irrigation intervals. Tillage exerts little influence on the yield
    and WUE. Results from Ganye were found to be generally higher than those recorded
    in Mubi and Yola; it also showed that an irrigation interval of 10 days with mulching
    could be adopted for the Ganye area, while seven days interval is more appropriate
    for Mubi and Yola.
