  title: Revealing the millipede and other soil-macrofaunal biodiversity in Hong Kong
    using a citizen science approach
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil biodiversity plays important roles in nutrient recycling\
    \ in both the environment and agriculture. However, they are generally understudied\
    \ worldwide. To reveal the diversity of soil macrofauna in Hong Kong, here we\
    \ initiated a citizen science project involving university, non-governmental organisations\
    \ and secondary school students and teachers. It is envisioned that the citizen\
    \ science approach used in this study could be used as a demonstration to future\
    \ biodiversity sampling and monitoring studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout a\
    \ year of monitoring and species sampling across different localities in Hong\
    \ Kong, 150 soil macrofaunal morphospecies were collected. Eighty five of them\
    \ were further identified by morphology and DNA barcoding was assigned to each\
    \ identified morphospecies, yielding a total of 646 DNA barcodes, with new millipede\
    \ sequences deposited to the GenBank. The soil macrofauna morphospecies in Hong\
    \ Kong found in this study are mainly dominated by millipedes (23 out of 150)\
    \ and oligochaetes (15 out of 150). Amongst the twenty three identified millipedes,\
    \ two polyxenid millipedes, &lt;i&gt;Monographis queenslandica&lt;/i&gt; Huynh\
    \ &amp; Veenstra, 2013 and &lt;i&gt;Alloproctoides remyi&lt;/i&gt; Marquet and\
    \ Cond\xE9, 1950 are first recorded in Hong Kong. Information has been curated\
    \ on an online platform and database (http://biodiversity.sls.cuhk.edu.hk/millipedes).\
    \ A postcard summarising the findings of millipedes in Hong Kong has also been\
    \ made as a souvenir and distributed to citizen participants. The identified macrofauna\
    \ morphospecies and their 646 DNA barcodes in this study established a solid foundation\
    \ for further research in soil biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;"
