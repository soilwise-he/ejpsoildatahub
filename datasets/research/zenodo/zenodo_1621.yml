  title: Assessment of Soil Erosion and Reservoir Sedimentation in Nira River basin
    in Maharashtra, India
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Safeguarding the water resources from soil erosion is a big
    challenge due to its nature and scale, which arises from the issues like intensification
    of agriculture, damage to land classes and other similar activities. Revised Universal
    Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with Geoinformatics is utilised for estimation of soil
    erosion. Sedimentation occurs due to the floods, change in climatic conditions
    like a global warning, change in cropping patterns and changing patterns of land
    use land cover, agricultural practices, deforestation, etc. and mainly causes
    cropping of such issues. Reservoir sedimentation is now a becoming a serious threat
    not only to safety of dams and but also becoming a serious social, economical
    and environmental problem. Sedimentation and its effects on dam are occurring
    all over the world. More than 2327 dams out of total 5264 dams in India are constructed
    before 1980, so there is urgent need to control the sedimentation process and
    also urgent need to minimize the operational problem of dam and its health hazards.
    It is further needed to assess the loss of water storage and its impacts on irrigation
    as well as other social and economical issues. According to the analysis in this
    study, 43.70 Ha-m/100 sq. km/year of rate of siltation is occurred during the
    period considered in the said study. As per the results from the analysis conducted
    in present study, the soil erosion in Nira River Basin is 43.70 Ha-m/100 sq. km/year,
    which is responsible for siltation in Bhatgar and Vir Reservoir. The result shows
    that the overall accuracy of RUSLE method is quite higher with 95.53% as compared
    to government analysis. Therefore, analysis reveals that RUSLE Model is more accurate
    and reliable for soil erosion analysis for similar type of study.&lt;/p&gt;'
