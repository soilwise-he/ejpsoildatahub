  title: EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE DITCHES ON WATER TABLE LEVEL, SOIL CONDITIONS AND TREE
    GROWTH OF DEGRADED PEATLAND FORESTS IN WEST KALIMANTAN
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Currently, tropical peatland forests are under considerable
    pressure because of increasing deforestation and degradation of forests. In Kalimantan,
    degradation and deforestation of peatland forests are driven primarily by industrial
    logging,&nbsp; expansion of agricultural activities through primarily conversion
    of forests to agricultural land and oil palm plantations. By the establishment
    of intensive drainage, it can induce wildfires in peatland. Unmanaged drainage
    ditches will alter water table levels within the site adjacent to the drainage
    including to surrounding peatland forest. Water table assessments were conducted
    before and after peatland drainage on 2007/2009 and 2012/2015 in Kubu Raya, West
    Kalimantan. This paper studies the effect of drainage ditches into the peatland
    water table. Results show the establishment of drainage ditches on this peatland
    landscape lowered the water table by more than 3 times from ~11.7 cm (SE = 1.5,
    n = 5) to ~37.3 cm (SE = 2.1 cm, n = 26). The effect on the water table was in
    drier months of&nbsp; July-August.&nbsp; Lowering the water table level altered
    worst the soil micro climate, peat temperature and peat water content. The results
    indicate the land use changes in peatland with the establishment of drainage affects
    peatland water table currently. In the area of less than 500 m from the drainage,
    the water level tends to lower toward the drainage feature. Therefore, recovery
    of peatland forests should be initiated by managing the landscape hydrology (i.e.
    water table) to restore the ecosystem and to protect the remaining peat swamp
    forest&lt;/p&gt;'
