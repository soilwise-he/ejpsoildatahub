  title: Soil Sample Before You Crop
  abstract: From an agriculture perspective, soil has been the second most important
    criteria, after the weather. The nature of soil determines the type of crops those
    can be grown with best yield. In ancient time, in absence of scientific methods,
    the soil quality was primarily determined by its physical characteristics. While
    those methods were sufficient then, as the necessity of fertilizers to generate
    maximum crop in limited timeframe or resources wasn't a factor, the modern expectations
    are to generate maximum produce within available resources and hence the soil
    selection after thorough testing comes into picture. The modern soil testing involves
    chemical and physical analysis that later becomes an input for crop nutrient selection.
