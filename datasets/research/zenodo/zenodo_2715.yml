  title: Effect of Phosphate Solubilizing Fungi from Rhizosphere soil of Medicinal
    plants on Growth and Phosphate uptake in Raphanus sativus
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>This field experiment deals with the isolation\
    \ and evaluation of phosphate solubilizing fungi of a total of 9 isolates isolated\
    \ from 10 rhizosphere soil of medicinal plants by serial dilution method using\
    \ Pikovaskaya\u2019s medium. After screening, 3 fungi were selected and evaluated,\
    \ PSF 7 (<em>Talaromyces</em> sp<strong>.</strong>) showed good results in phosphate\
    \ solubilization including solubilization index (3.08), reduced pH (3.2 from initial\
    \ pH 6.8), titrable acidity (38.08), and phosphate present in culture broth (25\xB5\
    g/ml). The radish seeds showed 88% germination and growth, yield parameters include,\
    \ plant height - 20.9cm, 40.8cm, and 71.5cm at 15 days, 30 days, and harvest respectively,\
    \ several leaves at 9, 13, and 17 at 15 days, 30days and harvest respectively,\
    \ root length (24.5cm), the weight of biomass (fresh weight -152 and dry weight\
    \ \u2013 15.7) and yield of root vegetable weight (39g). The maximum plant phosphorus\
    \ uptake was recorded as 0.371% and the maximum P (Kg/ha) available in the rhizosphere\
    \ soil was recorded as 344.29 Kg/ha. Due to the observation of good results in\
    \ phosphate solubilization, they improve the growth and yield of radish. The selected\
    \ PSF were recommended as phosphate bio inoculums in the agricultural field to\
    \ improve plant growth and yield in radish and to maintain soil fertility."
