  title: Effect of Different Acidifying Agents on Amendment in Buffering Capacity
    of Soil
  abstract: "Rising population has globally challenged the food security for all livings,\
    \ which ultimately need the agricultural land expansion to meet the demands. For\
    \ cultivations, along with other parameters, optimal availability of most of the\
    \ nutrients is found at pH less than 6. And alkaline soils covering more than\
    \ one fourth of the earth's surface constrain the wide range of available land\
    \ for cultivations. Amendments in pH are usually brought out by the addition of\
    \ either synthetic chemicals or natural biomass but, effectiveness of any amendment\
    \ is directly resisted by soil\u2019s buffering capacity. Buffering capacity retains\
    \ the pH of the soil. This study is designed to lower the soil pH as well as to\
    \ maintain it efficiently, over a long period of time by using various chemicals.\
    \ Chemicals tried to reduce the soil pH in this study were: aluminum sulphate\
    \ (Al2(SO4) 3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulphuric\
    \ acid (H2SO4). The chemicals were employed on three different textured soils\
    \ in batch, both individually and in combinations. The buffering capacity of different\
    \ soils was related with soil textures to compare the effects of chemical amendments\
    \ on individual soils. The soil-water (1:1) paste was kept at room temperature\
    \ for five months after the application of treatment. Most of the chemical treatments\
    \ not only lowered the pH significantly but retained it as well for longer period\
    \ of time, indicating suitability of cultivation at desired acidic pH, ranging\
    \ from 3-6."
