  title: Addressing Soil Health Management Issues In India
  abstract: "World has been observing 5th December since 2012 as the World Soil Day\
    \ to ensure maintenance of soil health, This was complimented by the United Nations\u2019\
    \ General Assembly declaring 2015, as the International Year of Soils to create\
    \ awareness among all stakeholders and promote more sustainable use of soil being\
    \ the critical resource. On this occasion, UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon had\
    \ said that without healthy soils life on Earth would be unsustainable. Indeed,\
    \ soils are the foundation of agriculture. He had urged all Governments to pledge\
    \ to do more to protect this important yet forgotten resource. A healthy life\
    \ is not possible without healthy soils. According to the Director General of\
    \ the FAO, Jose Graziano da Silva, today, world has more than 805 million people\
    \ facing hunger and malnutrition. Soils are under increased pressure because population\
    \ growth will require an approximately increase of 60 per cent in food output\
    \ and competing land uses. Unfortunately, 33 per cent of our global soil resources\
    \ are under degradation and human pressures on soils are reaching critical limits,\
    \ reducing and sometimes eliminating essential soil functions. He had emphasised\
    \ the role of all stakeholders in promoting the cause of soils as it is important\
    \ for paving the road towards a real sustainable development for all and by all.\
    \ Against this background, this article briefly highlights the significance and\
    \ aspects of soil health management in India and suggests aspects of strategic\
    \ action plan to conserve this precious resource for the benefit of mankind."
