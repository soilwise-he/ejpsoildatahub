  title: A modelling approach to discriminate contributions of soil hydrological properties
    and slope gradient to water stress in Mediterranean vineyards
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Grapevine is a widespread crop for grape and wine production,\
    \ often cultivated on hilly areas. Moderate vine water stress plays an important\
    \ role in determining high-quality viticulture. However, a precise quantification\
    \ of the effect of hydraulic properties and slope gradient on hilly soil water\
    \ balance and consequently on vine stress has not yet been addressed in the literature.\
    \ The slope-gradient effect is generally taken for granted, without providing\
    \ experiments validating such a qualitative assumption. We tested the hypothesis\
    \ that soil hydraulic properties play a greater role than slope gradient in driving\
    \ soil water status and vine stress. In two consecutive years, we studied an &ldquo;Aglianico&rdquo;\
    \ vineyard grown along a 90\u202Fm slope, with up-slope soil having lower water\
    \ holding capacity than down-slope. Up-slope vines were more stressed, as shown\
    \ by lower leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, leaf CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;assimilation\
    \ and leaf area index, than down-slope vines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Water flow\
    \ was simulated by using the Hydrus (2D/3D) model, calibrated and validated towards\
    \ a two-year set of soil water content measurements. Significantly lower soil\
    \ pressure head and higher transpiration occurred in the up- than the down-slope\
    \ site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A viable procedure was developed to separate the\
    \ effects of soil hydraulic properties and slope gradient by modelling soil water\
    \ balance and therefore vine transpiration with and without the slope gradient.\
    \ The simulations indicated that the difference in seasonal relative transpiration\
    \ of 8% in 2011 and 5% in 2012 between the two sites was due to their differing\
    \ soil hydraulic properties, and that the slope gradient had no contribution to\
    \ this variation.&lt;/p&gt;"
