  title: IMPACT OF SOIL TEXTURE AND NUMBER OF CELLS ON ELECTRICITY GENERATION UNDER
    CLOSED SYSTEM
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> This study aimed to investigate the effect of
    three textured soils on electricity generation using a different number of cells
    (2, 4, 6, and 8) under a closed system. The voltage and current readings were
    measured at an interval of every 24 hours for ten days, using a voltmeter, electric
    light bulb, and a hand calculator. Experimental results indicated that voltage
    values were found in the same range for the different soils and cells number.
    When using 2 and 4 cells, the voltage reading remained stable until the end of
    the experiment, giving the lowest values for voltage and current. Maximum voltage
    and current were achieved with 8 cells. In general, the voltage, current, and
    power reading decrease with decreasing number of cells. The best soil to use for
    generation of electricity was the silty clay loam (S3), delivering a peak voltage
    of 3.297 mV, a peak current of 0.039 mA, and a power of 0.115 mW after 240 hours.
    The power obtained was the same as a trend of the current.
