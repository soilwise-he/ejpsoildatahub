  title: The Automated Soil Erosion Monitoring System (Asems)
  abstract: 'The advancements in technology allow the

    development of a new system that can continuously measure surface

    soil erosion. Continuous soil erosion measurements are required in

    order to comprehend the erosional processes and propose effective

    and efficient conservation measures to mitigate surface erosion.

    Mitigating soil erosion, especially in Mediterranean countries such as

    Greece, is essential in order to maintain environmental and

    agricultural sustainability. In this paper, we present the Automated

    Soil Erosion Monitoring System (ASEMS) that measures surface soil

    erosion along with other factors that impact erosional process.

    Specifically, this system measures ground level changes (surface soil

    erosion), rainfall, air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture.

    Another important innovation is that the data will be collected by

    remote communication. In addition, stakeholder''s awareness is a key

    factor to help reduce any environmental problem. The different

    dissemination activities that were utilized are described. The overall

    outcomes were the development of a new innovative system that can

    measure erosion very accurately. These data from the system help

    study the process of erosion and find the best possible methods to

    reduce erosion. The dissemination activities enhance the stakeholders

    and public''s awareness on surface soil erosion problems and will lead

    to the adoption of more effective soil erosion conservation practices

    in Greece.'
