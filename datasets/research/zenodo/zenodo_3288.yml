  title: Response Of Buildings With Soil-Structure Interaction With Varying Soil Types
  abstract: 'Over the years, it has been extensively established that<br>

    the practice of assuming a structure being fixed at base, leads to gross<br>

    errors in evaluation of its overall response due to dynamic loadings<br>

    and overestimations in design. The extent of these errors depends on<br>

    a number of variables; soil type being one of the major factor. This<br>

    paper studies the effect of Soil Structure Interaction (SSI) on multistorey<br>

    buildings with varying under-laying soil types after proper<br>

    validation of the effect of SSI. Analysis for soft, stiff and very stiff<br>

    base soils has been carried out, using a powerful Finite Element<br>

    Method (FEM) software package ANSYS v14.5. Results lead to<br>

    some very important conclusions regarding time period, deflection<br>

    and acceleration responses.'
