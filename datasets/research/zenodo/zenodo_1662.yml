  title: Research on dynamic evolution of soil salinization in Tianjin costal area
    using remote sensing
  abstract: Soil Salinization is one of the most devastating land degradation in agriculture
    and environment all around the world. The salinization classification map composed
    of four stages of salinity can be generated using remote sensing technology. In
    this paper we propose a semi-supervised procedure for dynamic evolution monitoring
    of soil salinization in Tianjin costal area based on the use of Landsat data.
    The trends and extents of soil salinization for a period from 1989 to 2009 are
    investigated every 10 years. Compared with traditional 2-D spectral space of NIR-R
    bands, the results reveals that highly saline soils can be easily differentiated
    in NDVI-Brightness 2-D spectral space, which is a powerful tool for exploring
    salinization information in Landsat data. Mapping and monitoring soil salinization
    changes in arid and semi-arid regions by means of remote sensing is effective
    for producing detailed and accurate land degradation information.
