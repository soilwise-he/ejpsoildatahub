  title: Soil physico-chemical properties have a greater effect on soil fungi than
    host species in Mediterranean pure and mixed pine forests
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil fungi are fundamental drivers of forest ecosystem processes.
    Soil physico-chemical parameters and vegetation features such as host type or
    stand structure can affect soil fungal communities. However, there is a lack of
    comprehensive studies describing the relative importance of niche processes (soil
    physico-chemistry and forest structural drivers) versus neutral processes (geographical
    distance) driving soil fungal community assemblages, especially in less-studied
    drought-prone ecosystems such as Mediterranean forests. In this study, we performed
    Pacific Biosciences sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 amplicons to characterize
    the soil fungal community composition and diversity of 42 forests dominated by
    either pure &lt;em&gt;Pinus nigra&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Pinus halepensis &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt;
    Pinus sylvestris &lt;/em&gt;or a &lt;em&gt;P. nigra&ndash;P. halepensis &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt;
    P. nigra&ndash;P. sylvestris &lt;/em&gt;mixture. Our specific aims were to identify
    and disentangle the relative importance of the main soil type and the spatial
    and forest structural factors that accounted for the greatest proportion of fungal
    community variation along a regional gradient in the Mediterranean Pre-Pyrenees.
    Soil parameters accounted for the greatest significant proportion of the total
    variance in the overall fungal community (25%), and in the mycorrhizal (23%) and
    saprotrophic (22%) communities, while geographical distance accounted for 14%
    of the variance in the overall fungal community, 7% in the mycorrhizal and 22%
    in the saprotrophic communities. Conversely, forest structure did not significantly
    affect the soil fungal community, and fungal composition and diversity did not
    differ significantly among the pine hosts. Moreover, pH, followed by P and the
    C:N ratio explained the largest differences in the composition of the overall
    fungal community and in the mycorrhizal fungal community. By contrast, the largest
    proportion of differences in saprotrophic composition were explained by geographical
    distance, closely followed by the C:N ratio and N. Our results show that, in Mediterranean
    pine forests, soil parameters are the most important driving forces shaping soil
    fungal communities at the regional scale given that ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic
    fungi were more influenced by soil physico-chemical tolerances or geographical
    distance than by &lt;em&gt;Pinus &lt;/em&gt;species or forest structural variables.
    Finally, P content in soils also emerged as a significant factor driving differences
    in mycorrhizal communities.&lt;/p&gt;'
