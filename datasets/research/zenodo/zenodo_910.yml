  title: Effect of Fineness of Soil on California Bearing Ratio Value
  abstract: Being the bottom- most layer of a road, the sub-grade soil acts as one
    of the most important load-bearing strata on which the performance and design
    of a pavement depend essentially. The grain size of soil particles plays a significant
    role in strength characteristics of the sub-grade as working recommendations vary
    significantly respecting varying particle sizes. Generally, California Bearing
    Ratio (CBR) value is widely used for the evaluation of subgrade strengths. Since
    this test is an expansive and time-consuming one, it is much needed to establish
    an alternative approach to determine the CBR value from some other physical properties
    of soils, which are easy, cheap, and low time consuming with limited facilities
    for laboratory experiments. To confront this, an attempt has been conducted in
    this study to correlate CBR value of sub-grade with some physical properties of
    soils, such as Fineness Modulus (FM) along with grain sizes. Six types of fine
    sands were collected from six notable sites, i.e bed of River Payera in Borguna,
    River Katcha in Pirojpur, River Shayendha in Barisal, River Kapotakkha in Khulna,
    River Bhairab in Bagerhat, and one sample was collected from subsoil in Jessore.
    At the initial stage, the necessary engineering properties of soils, like fineness
    modulus, grain size distribution, unit weight, dry density, and optimum moisture
    content, were determined, followed by thirty CBR samples with different FM values
    at optimum moisture content. After that, a correlation was established in the
    form of an equation to express CBR value as a function of fineness modulus using
    regression analysis. From field and laboratory test results, it was found that
    the six sands are uniformly graded non-plastic fine sand with FM 0.13 to 0.26
    and their PI is less than 5 and LL is less than 30. CBR of sands lies in between
    11.44% to 12.09% and their swelling is in between 0.58% to 0.69%. The equation
    of co-relation is y = 0.0496x + 0.1081, where y refers to CBR (%) and x refers
    to Fineness modulus. From which one can ascertain the probable CBR value of find
    sand corresponding its FM value. With the help of this study, the CBR value of
    soil sample can be predicted in an easier, cheap, and less time-consuming manner
    to classify and evaluate the soil sub-grade rather than conventional CBR test.
