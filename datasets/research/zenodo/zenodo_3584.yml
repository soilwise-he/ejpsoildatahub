  title: Construction Technology Of Modified Vacuum  Pre-Loading Method For Slurry
    Dredged Soil
  abstract: Slurry dredged soil at coastal area has a high water content, poor permeability,
    and low surface intensity. Hence, it is infeasible to use vacuum preloading method
    to treat this type of soil foundation. For the special case of super soft ground,
    a floating bridge is first constructed on muddy soil and used as a service road
    and platform for implementing the modified vacuum preloading method. The modified
    technique of vacuum preloading and its construction process for the super soft
    soil foundation improvement is then studied. Application of modified vacuum preloading
    method shows that the technology and its construction process are highly suitable
    for improving the super soft soil foundation in coastal areas.
