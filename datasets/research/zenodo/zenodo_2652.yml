  title: Utilization of Wood Ash as Soil Amendment and Fertilizer on Some Growth and
    Physiological Indices of Capsicum annum (pepper)
  abstract: "Sustainable utilization of wastes such as wood ash generated by small\
    \ scale industries is an innovative method of waste management. This study elucidated\
    \ effects of varying levels (250 mL WALF + 750 Water, 500 mL WALF + 500 mL Water,\
    \ 750 mL WALF+ 250 mL Water, 1000mL WALF) of inclusion of wood ash liquid fertilizer\
    \ (WALF) on cultivation of C. annum (pepper). Distilled water served as control.\
    \ Agronomical and physiological parameters of the pepper were determined. Height\
    \ (18.82 cm), number of leaf (16.60), leaf breadth (3.58 cm), and stem girth (0.90\
    \ cm) of the pepper treated with combination 500 mL WALF + 500 mL Water were significantly\
    \ higher compared with other combinations of the WALF. Similar observation was\
    \ noticed in chlorophyll (13.6 \xB5mol m-2) contents determined in the leaves\
    \ of the pepper treated with the same combination. Higher net assimilation rate\
    \ (0.80 gm-2day-1), relative growth rate (0.78 mgg-1day-1), leaf area ratio (0.08\
    \ m2 kg-1), leaf area (83.56 cm) and specific leaf area (142.56m2 .kg-1) were\
    \ observed in the leaves of the pepper treated with 500 mL WALF + 500 mL Water.\
    \ In conclusion the 500 mL WALF + 500 mL Water enhanced better the agronomic and\
    \ physiological parameters of the vegetable, therefore, the combination is recommended\
    \ for sustainable cultivation of pepper.\_"
