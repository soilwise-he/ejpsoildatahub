  title: Determination of Pullout Strength of Geogrid in Sandy Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Geogrid reinforcement of soil has been successfully used for
    many years in a wide variety of applications. This paper presents data obtained
    from a series of laboratory tests performed on the geogrid. The tests were conducted
    to determine the mechanical property including the tensile strength of the geogrid
    and its corresponding pullout test. Tests were performed to find out the effect
    of width of geogrid on the pullout resistance. It was found that the pull-out
    resistance of geogrid is a function of the relative density of the soil, the length
    and the width of geogrid specimen. A mechanism of soil-geogrid interaction is
    described and used to explain the results of&#39; the pull-out tests. A significant
    finding is that the selection of geogrid specimen dimensions for laboratory pullout
    tests must take into account the strain to failure of the soil and the stiffness
    of the geogrid in order to properly represent the maximum pull-out stress that
    will be available in field applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
