  title: The Role of Environmental Factors in the Formation of Soil Cover Structure
    of the Zeyamchay Basin
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Zayamchay basin is selected by its complex structure, various
    climatic conditions, rich vegetation and soil&ndash;rich rocks. This variation
    of soil-forming factors has led to the formation of various forms of soil cover
    structure within the basin. Therefore, the study of land and its space manifestation
    &mdash; the soil cover structure, detail mapping, evaluation and optimization
    &mdash; both scientifically&ndash;theoretical and practical. The Zeyamchay basin,
    which is located on the northwestern slope of the Lesser Caucasus, is the object
    of the research. The Zeyamchay basin is selected by its complex relief structure,
    various climatic conditions, rich vegetation and soil&ndash;rich rocks. The area
    of the basin is 94200 hectares. The basin covers part of Tovuz, Shamkir and Gadabay
    districts from the administrative point of view. These kinds of soil-forming factors
    have led to the formation of different forms of soil cover structure within the
    basin. During the research, empirical information is collected from cartographic,
    soil research, aerospace, landscape and geomorphological methods and so on was
    used.&lt;/p&gt;'
