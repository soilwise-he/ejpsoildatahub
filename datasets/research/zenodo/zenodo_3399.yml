  title: Computation of Permeability of Soil using Artificial Intelligence Approaches
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Decision Tree (DT), Relevance
    Vector Machine (RVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) AI approaches are constructed
    in MATLAB R2020a with different hyperparameters namely, kernel function, leaf
    size, backpropagation algorithms, number of neurons and hidden layers to compute
    the permeability of soil. The present study is carried out using 158 datasets
    of soil. The soil dataset consists of fine content (FC), sand content (SC), liquid
    limit (LL), specific gravity (SG), plasticity index (PI), maximum dry density
    (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC), permeability (K). Excluding the permeability
    of soil, rest of properties of soil is used as input parameters of the AI models.
    The best architectural and optimum performance models are identified by comparing
    the performance of the models. Based on the performance of the AI models, the
    NISEK_K_GPR, 10LF_K_DT, Poly _K_RVM, and GDANN_K_10H5 models have been identified
    as the best architectural AI models. The comparison of performance of the best
    architectural models, it is observed that the NISEK_K_GPR model outperformed the
    other best architectural AI models. In this study, it is also observed that GPR
    model is outperformed ANN models because of small dataset. The performance of
    NISEK_K_GPR model is compared with models available in literature and it is concluded
    that the GPR model has better performance and least prediction error than models
    available in literature study.&lt;/p&gt;'
