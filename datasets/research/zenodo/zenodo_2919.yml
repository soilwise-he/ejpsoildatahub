  title: Fortifying Rice Climate Resilience Through Deep Insights into the Potential
    of Cyanobacteria to Improve Grain Yield, Grain Quality, and Soil Fertility
  abstract: 'The projected uncontrolled growth in the human population entails an
    accrued food demand which compromises environmental sustainability with severe
    impacts on depleting natural resources. Improving crops yield without compromising
    the environment will be one of the main challenges of the next decades. Aiming
    to ensure food security goals through consistent provision of sustainable energy
    and food without compromising environmental stability is the current requirement
    under threats of climate change, uncontrolled global population, and scarcity
    of natural resources. Increased agricultural dependence on chemical sources as
    ways of increasing food productivity has posed severe threats to the ecological
    balance and is becoming less eco-efficient. The utilization of favourable soil
    microbes as a key substitute for chemical fertilizers in food-producing systems
    can prove a potential solution to this riddle. Recently, blue-green algae (BGA)
    also termed cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes have been concealed
    as potential agents to satisfy the needs for bioenergy due to their native abilities
    of efficiently harvesting solar energy and converting it into biomass by simple
    dependence on CO2, nutrients, and water. These free-living and symbiotic cyanobacteria
    convert solar energy into required chemical energy by producing oxygen as a byproduct.
    Various cyanobacterial species generate biomass that can be utilized in different
    commercial industries such as food supplements, biofertilizers, pharmaceuticals,
    and cosmetics. Hence, cyanobacteria application can be termed eco-friendly technology
    leading towards agricultural sustainability with enhanced productivity. Moreover,
    efficient application of cyanobacteria can intend climate change mitigation by
    lowering GHG emissions and bioremediation of contaminated soil and water. However,
    before the commercial application of BGA, net economic profitability and viability
    should be undertaken. This review article presents different ways of utilization
    of BGA in agricultural systems to increase productivity via maintaining agricultural
    and environmental sustainability. This article suggests future research to focus
    on the utilization of already available indigenous cyanobacterial strains and
    also searching for new species to explore the symbiotic mechanisms executed with
    other beneficial soil microbes as a productive, innocuous, and environmental-friendly
    perspective towards the management of the rhizosphere to encourage plant growth
    and development. Keywords: Climate-smart agriculture; cyanobacteria; biofertilizers;
    biological N-fixation; soil fertility'
