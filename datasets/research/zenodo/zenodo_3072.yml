  title: 'Distance-Based Vegetation Indices Computed by Saga GIS: A Comparison of
    the Perpendicular and Transformed Soil Adjusted Approaches for the Landsat TM
    Image'
  abstract: "Landsat-TM of 2001 covering Iceland (15.5\xB0W-21\xB0W, 64.5\xB0N-67\xB0\
    N) was processed using SAGA GIS for testing distance-based Vegetation Indices\
    \ (VIs): four approaches of Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) and two approaches\
    \ of Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index TSAVI. The PVI of vegetation from\
    \ the soil background line indicated healthiness as a leaf area index (LAI). The\
    \ results showed that the reflectance for vegetation has a linear relation with\
    \ soil background line. Four PVI models and two TSAVI shown coefficients of determination\
    \ with LAI. The dataset demonstrate variations in the calculated coefficients.\
    \ The mode in the histograms of the PVI based on four different algorithms show\
    \ the difference: -7.1, -8.36, 2.78 and 7.0. The dataset for the two approaches\
    \ of TSAVI: first case ranges in 4.4.-80.6 with a bell- shape mode of a histogram\
    \ (8.09 to 23.29) for the first algorithm and an irregular shape for the second\
    \ algorithm with several modes starting from 0.11 to 0.2 and decreasing to 0.26.\
    \ SAGA GIS permits the calculation of PVI and TSAVI by computed NDVI based on\
    \ the intersection of vegetation and soil background. Masking the NIR and R, a\
    \ linear regression of grids was performed using an equation embedded in SAGA\
    \ GIS. The advantages of the distance-based PVI and TSAVI consists in the adjusted\
    \ position of pixels on the soil brightness line which refines it comparing to\
    \ the slope-based VIs. The paper demonstrates SAGA GIS application in agricultural\
    \ studies."
