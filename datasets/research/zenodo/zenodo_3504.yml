  title: Frequency Response Analysis Of Reinforced- Soil Retaining Walls With Polymeric
    Strips
  abstract: 'Few studies have been conducted on polymeric strip

    and the behavior of soil retaining walls. This paper will present the

    effect of frequency on the dynamic behavior of reinforced soil

    retaining walls with polymeric strips. The frequency content

    describes how the amplitude of a ground motion is distributed among

    different frequencies. Since the frequency content of an earthquake

    motion will strongly influence the effects of that motion, the

    characterization of the motion cannot be completed without the

    consideration of its frequency content. The maximum axial force of

    reinforcements and horizontal displacement of the reinforced walls

    are focused in this research. To clarify the dynamic behavior of

    reinforced soil retaining walls with polymeric strips, a numerical

    modeling using Finite Difference Method is benefited. As the results

    indicate, the frequency of input base acceleration has an important

    effect on the behavior of these structures. Because of resonant in the

    system, where the frequency of the input dynamic load is equal to the

    natural frequency of the system, the maximum horizontal

    displacement and the maximum axial forces in polymeric strips is

    occurred. Moreover, they were to increase the structure flexibility

    because of the main advantages of polymeric strips; i.e. being simple

    method of construction, having a homogeneous behavior with soils,

    and possessing long durability, which are of great importance in

    dynamic analysis.'
