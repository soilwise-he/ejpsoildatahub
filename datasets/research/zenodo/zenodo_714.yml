  title: Experimental Investigation On Soil With Pond Ash And Alccofine
  abstract: "Cohesive soil causes great engineering problems due to its poor strength,\
    \ high compressibility and low permeability. It covers large and extensively located\
    \ areas of India and also many parts of the world. Silty soil extends in large\
    \ stretches and construction of pavements and other structures on such type of\
    \ soils is a great problem. To set right these problems, it is very much necessary\
    \ to treat these soils. There are so many methods for the treatment of these soils.\
    \ Some of them are very costly and some are very tedious. Several-methods of soil-improvement\
    \ using Pozzolanic materials have been developed and used successfully in practice.\
    \ The treatment of soft clayey soils with flyash, Rice husk ash, Phasphogypsum\
    \ along with small quantity of cement is very simple, economical and pollution\
    \ controlling. It has been useful in a diversity of civil-engineering works, like\
    \ in the construction of base-courses, where good materials are not economically\
    \ available; for reducing the permeability and compressibility of soils in hydraulic\
    \ and foundation works; for stabilization of slopes, embankments and excavations.\
    \ A considerable amount of research concerning stabilization of soil with additives\
    \ such as cement, alccofine, lime \u2013 fly ash and salt, bitumen and polymers\
    \ is available in the literature. Likewise, the coal ash considered as an industrial\
    \ waste can be effectively used in the construction industry."
