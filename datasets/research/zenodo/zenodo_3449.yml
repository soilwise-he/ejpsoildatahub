  title: Reliability Based Investigation on the Choice of Characteristic Soil Properties
  abstract: "By using partial factors of safety, uncertainties due to the inherent\
    \ variability of the soil properties and loads are taken into account in the geotechnical\
    \ design process. According to the reliability index concept in Eurocode-0 in\
    \ conjunction with Eurocode-7 a minimum safety level of \u03B2 = 3.8 for reliability\
    \ class RC2 shall be established. The reliability of the system depends heavily\
    \ on the choice of the prespecified safety factor and the choice of the characteristic\
    \ soil properties. The safety factors stated in the standards are mainly based\
    \ on experience. However, no general accepted method for the calculation of a\
    \ characteristic value within the current design practice exists. In this study,\
    \ a laterally loaded monopile is investigated and the influence of the chosen\
    \ quantile values of the deterministic system, calculated with p-y springs, will\
    \ be presented. Monopiles are the most common foundation concepts for offshore\
    \ wind energy converters. Based on the calculations for non-cohesive soils, a\
    \ recommendation for an appropriate quantile value for the necessary safety level\
    \ according to the standards for a deterministic design is given."
