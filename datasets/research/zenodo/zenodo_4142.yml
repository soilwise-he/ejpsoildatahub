  title: EFFECTS ON MODIFIED PROPERTIES OF EXPANSIVE CLAY SOIL USING WASTE HOLLOW
    CONCRETE BLOCK (HCB) AND CEMENT PLASTER WASTE MATERIALS FOR SUBGRADE CONSTRUCTION
  abstract: Expansive soils characterized by changing its volume and strength due
    to seasonal variations. Due to this volume changes, expansive clay soil caused
    many problems in road construction and is relatively common in Ethiopia. As a
    result, such types of soil are not adequately for road construction, which requires
    proper attention. The focus of this study was to improve the engineering properties
    of the expansive clay soil with the addition of waste materials to use as a subgrade
    construction material. Soil samples were taken from three locations within the
    study area and performed laboratory tests for the moisture content, specific gravity,
    free swelling, Atterberg limit, and compaction test on its natural state. The
    expansiveness of the soil from the three locations were determined. The highest
    value of expansiveness from these samples considered for the experiment by the
    addition of waste materials concentration with 5%, 10% 20%, and 30% by weight.
    Test results indicated that the moisture content, free swelling, specific gravity
    Atterberg limit decreased, while the maximum dry density increased as the concentration
    of waste material increase. Hence, the minimum amount of waste materials comprised
    of 10% that will improve the strength of expansive clay soil for use in road subgrade
    construction.
