  title: Improving Yasso15 soil carbon model estimates with Ensemble Adjustment Kalman
    Filter state data assimilation
  abstract: Model-calculated forecasts of soil organic carbon (SOC) are important
    for approximating global terrestrial carbon pools and assessing their change.
    However, the lack of detailed observations limits the reliability and applicability
    of these SOC projections. Here, we studied if state data assimilation (SDA) can
    be used to continuously update the modeled state with available total carbon measurements
    in order to improve future SOC estimations. We chose six fallow test sites with
    measurements time series spanning 30 to 80 years for this initial test. In all
    cases, SDA improved future projections but to varying degrees. Furthermore, already
    including the first few measurements impacted the state enough to reduce the error
    in decades long projections in by at least 1 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>. Our results
    show the benefits of implementing SDA methods for forecasting SOC, but also highlight
    implementation aspects that need consideration and further research.
