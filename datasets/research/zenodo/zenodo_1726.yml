  title: Determination of Some Physicochemical Properties of Soil from Vicinity of
    Chemistry Department, Bago University
  abstract: In the research work, some physicochemical properties of soil from vicinity
    of chemistry department, Bago University have been determined. Some physicochemical
    parameters (texture, moisture, pH), organic matter, nutrients and relative abundance
    of elements of soil sample from study area have done by conventional and modern
    spectroscopic techniques. The texture class is sandy loam. The soil has found
    to have moisture contents 0.71% and pH 5.77, the contents of nutrients (nitrogen,
    phosphorus and potassium) were found to be 0.16%, 10.23 ppm and 4.88 mg/100g respectively.
    Low organic carbon content 1.67% and humus 2.88% were also observed. Relative
    abundance of elements in soil sample, Si 77.65%, Fe 11.50%, Tl 4.14%, K 3.74%
    and Ca 1.24% were also observed.
