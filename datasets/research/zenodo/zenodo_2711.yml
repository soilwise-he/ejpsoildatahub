  title: Response of Maize (Zea mays L.) to soil conditioning and moisture regimes
    in arid environment of Dera Ismail Khan
  abstract: <em>Soil conditioners were used to enhance the physical conditions of
    soil and provide a favorable environment for the growth and development of maize
    crop. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of soil conditioning and
    moisture regimes on the performance of maize crop during 2016 and 2017. Four moisture
    regimes ranging from 3-6 irrigation in relation to the critical stages of maize
    crop were applied. Irrigation consisted of 93 mm of water. Tree organic soil conditioners
    viz., farmyard manure (10000 kg ha-1), wheat straw as crop residue (10000 kg ha-1)
    and two levels of humic acid (2 and 4 kg ha-1), alone and in combinations with
    gypsum (1000 kg ha-1) as inorganic soil conditioner were applied a week before
    sowing of maize. The design used was a randomized complete block with split plot
    arrangement replicated thrice. The experimental site was Agricultural Research
    Institute, Horticulture, Dera Ismail Khan. Moisture regimes were subjected to
    main plots while soil conditioners to subplots. Results of the two years study
    indicated that most of the yield and soil parameters were affected by irrigation
    regimes significantly. Higher crop growth rate, leaf area plant, plant height,
    biological yield (above ground parts of the plant), grain and straw N contents
    were found in fve times irrigated plots as compared with lower irrigation regime.
    Results showed that growth characteristics and quality of maize were significantly
    affected by soil conditioners (SC). Farmyard manure incorporation produced significantly
    higher crop growth rate, leaf area plant-1, taller plant, higher biological yield,
    grain and straw N contents of maize crop as compared to other soil conditioners
    and control treatments. Data on the effect of gypsum application as sole or in
    combination with the other SC revealed that addition of gypsum had significantly
    increased all parameters as compared with no gypsum application. It is concluded
    that farmyard manure (10000 kg ha-1) and gypsum (1000 kg ha-1) with five irrigations
    at the known critical stages (at emergence, 4 leaves, 8 leaves and tassel visible
    and blister) performed better as compared with other treatments applied for obtaining
    good return from maize crop in Dera Ismail khan, Pakistan</em>
