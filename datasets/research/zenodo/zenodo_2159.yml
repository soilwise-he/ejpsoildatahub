  title: Effects of Different Organic Soil Amendments on Nitrogen Nutrition and Yield
    of Organic Greenhouse Tomato Crop
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Manure is a common source of nitrogen (N) in organic farming.
    However, manure is not always easily available, while the maximum N amount added
    as animal manure in organic agriculture is restricted by EU regulations. The present
    study was designed to test whether green manuring with a warm-season legume and
    intercropping with a cold-season legume can substitute farm-yard manure or compost
    as N sources in organic greenhouse tomato crops. To test this hypothesis, a winter-spring
    (WS) tomato crop was installed in February following the incorporation of crop
    residues of an autumn-winter (AW) tomato crop intercropped with faba bean, which
    had been fertilized with cowpea residues as green manure. This treatment, henceforth
    termed legume treatment (LT), was compared with the use of compost or manure as
    an N fertilization source in both tomato crops. In addition, a combination of
    compost and LT was also used as a fourth treatment. The results showed that green
    manuring with legumes and particularly cowpea can contribute a significant amount
    of N to the following organic tomato crop, through the biological fixation process.
    Nevertheless, legumes as green manure, or compost, or their combination cannot
    efficiently replace farmyard manure as an N fertilization source. Compost exhibited
    a slow mineralization course.&lt;/p&gt;'
