  title: PARASITIC STAGES ISOLATION FROM SOIL SAMPLES OF KIRKUK TECHNICAL COLLEGE
  abstract: '<strong>Introduction</strong>: Soil is an influential source of human
    diseases, including parasitic infections. Parasitic diseases represent a potential
    risk factor on human health and his belongings. This study aimed to evaluate soil
    contamination level with parasitic stages of soil samples from Kirkuk Technical
    College.  <strong>Methods</strong>: 110 soil samples were collected from various
    sites of  Kirkuk Technical College by simple random selection. The samples were
    scanned by direct wet mount, sedimentation, floatation, Modified acid-fast stain
    and Baermann method. <strong>Results</strong>: The overall rate of parasitic contamination
    was 23.63%. The most prevalent parasite stage was <em>Toxocara sp.</em> eggs with
    rate of 7.3%, followed by <em>S. stercoralis</em> larva with rate of 5.5%. Concentration
    technique was more effective in detecting soil parasites comparing with the other
    used methods. Parasites prevalence was approximately similar in both Autumn and
    Winter months. Soil parasites were more existed in acidic and moist soil samples.
    <strong>Conclusions</strong>: Different helminthic and protozoan stages are contaminating
    soil samples of Kirkuk Technical College; these stages can effectively be detected
    by concentration method.  <strong>Recommendations</strong>: Efforts are better
    to be directed toward eliminating these parasites through using appropriate ways
    for waste handling and controlling stray dogs, cats and rodents in the college.
    More investigations are required on parasitic prevalence among this college staff
    and students.'
