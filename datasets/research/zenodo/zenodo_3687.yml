  title: Comparison between Manual Irrigation System and Automatic Irrigation System
    Based-on Soil Moisture
  abstract: "<em>Food productivity is one of the vital factors of human\u2019s need.\
    \ Nowadays, food productivity rate is unsustainable with the food demand. The\
    \ crop\u2019s quality and quantity tend to get lower as the climate starts getting\
    \ extremely erratic. The degradation of quality and quantity are also depended\
    \ on the decreasing number of the farmer. This condition is also worsened by the\
    \ water scarcity. To prevent the deterioration, we need to take a deeper look\
    \ on what matters on the crop\u2019s growth which is soil moisture. Soil moisture\
    \ can dissolve the minerals in soil to help crops meet their nutritional needs.\
    \ The research alternative way of maintaining the soil moisture is to have an\
    \ automatic irrigation system using microcontroller and soil moisture sensors.\
    \ This technology can increase the effectiveness of water usage on irrigation\
    \ system. From this experiment, we have observed that the automatic irrigation\
    \ system can provide a sustainable water resources to keep the soil moisture stable.\
