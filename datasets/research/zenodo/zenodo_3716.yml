  title: 'A REVIEW: IMPACT OF SOIL SALINITY ON ECOLOGICAL, AGRICULTURAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC
    CONCERNS'
  abstract: In recent years, salinization of soil is one of the challenging environmental
    concerns occurring all over the world. The effects of concentration of salt can
    be detected in both natural (primary) as well as man-made (secondary) environment.
    This is due to massive urbanization and industrialization in coastal regions,
    Soil salinity may lead to degradative changes in the composition of natural water
    resources, loss of fertile soil, loss of biodiversity, changes in local climatic
    conditions which in turn affects many aspects like, increasing salinization (salt
    affected soil) of lands converted in to non-productive conditions which significantly
    affects human life and posing major interruption to the economic development of
    farmers and their economy in the country. Furthermore, the overview of salinization
    and its effects on ecology, agriculture and economic growth and development is
    presented in this paper. Purpose of this review paper represented is according
    to most recent literature and refines knowledge on consistent research efforts
    for the types of soil salinity, problems of soil salinization, effect on plant
    growth and management strategies in agriculture to mitigate soil conditions in
    the salinity affected areas as well as rise in crop productivity and suggests
    future perspectives for on-going salinity research in the country.
