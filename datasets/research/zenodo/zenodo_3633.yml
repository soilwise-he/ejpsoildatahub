  title: Effect Of Isfahan Refinery, Power Plant And Petrochemical On Borkhar District
    Soil
  abstract: 'This study aimed to evaluate regional soil Borkhar of

    the metals Lead has been made. In this field study fires visits to the

    regions. The limit of this study located in the East refineries,

    petrochemical and power plant to 20 km was selected. The 41 soil

    samples from depths of 0 to 10 cm in area and were randomized. Soil

    samples were transported to the laboratory and by air was dry and

    passed through 2-mil thickness sieve. In the laboratory of physical

    and chemical characteristics and concentrations of total absorption

    was measured. The results showed that the amount of lead in soil in

    many parts of the range higher than the standard limit. Survey maps

    show that the lead spatial distribution of the region does not special

    pattern.'
