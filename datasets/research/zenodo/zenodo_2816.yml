  title: SOIL ORGANIC CARBON CHANGES FOLLOWING DEGRADATION AND CONVERSION TO CYPRESS
    AND TEA PLANTATIONS IN A TROPICAL MOUNTAIN FOREST OF KENYA
  abstract: "This is the pre-print version of the article \"SOIL ORGANIC CARBON CHANGES\
    \ FOLLOWING DEGRADATION AND CONVERSION TO CYPRESS AND TEA PLANTATIONS IN A TROPICAL\
    \ MOUNTAIN FOREST OF KENYA\" published as final article in Plant and Soil Volume\
    \ 422, Issue 1-2, 1 January 2018, Pages 527-539, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3489-1\
    \ <strong>Abstract</strong> Aims: This study investigates, in a montane forest\
    \ in Kenya, the changes in amount and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) as\
    \ a consequence of: a) forest degradation, by comparing primary and degraded forests;\
    \ b) the replacement of degraded forests with cypress and tea plantations, by\
    \ considering sites installed at different time in the past. Methods: The SOC\
    \ concentrations and stocks were determined in different layers to 1 m depth,\
    \ and the SOC turnover time (TT) derived by measuring the 14C concentration in\
    \ the layers within the 0- 30 cm depth. Results: A significant SOC decline was\
    \ evident in the 0-5 and 5-15 cm layers of degraded forest while, on the long\
    \ term, both plantations induced a significant SOC increase in the 0-30 cm depth.\
    \ The longer TT\xB4s and lower SOC concentrations in the upper layers of degraded\
    \ rather than primary forests imply an impact of forest degradation on the decomposition\
    \ of the fast cycling SOC. Similarly, the shorter TT with increasing plantations\
    \ age implies differences in SOC stabilization mechanisms between plantations\
    \ and forests. Conclusions: Cypress and tea plantations established on degraded\
    \ forests stimulate a long term SOC accrual but at the same time decrease the\
    \ stability of the SOC pool."
