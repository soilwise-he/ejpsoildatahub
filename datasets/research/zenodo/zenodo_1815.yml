  title: ACTIVITY TO PREVENT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OF CASCADE TYPE OF SPREADING RELATED
    TO SOIL LANDSLIDE
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Landfills for solid waste with liquidation energy-intensive
    technological equipment, due to emergencies of the cascade type of distribution
    associated with the landslide of landfills, pose a man-made environmental hazard.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Experimental studies to determine the effect of humidity, density, temperature
    of landfill soils on the stability of slopes on landslides have shown that with
    increasing humidity and temperature, the resistance of the array to displacement
    decreases. The lower the density, the greater the ability to penetrate and saturate
    with moisture, which creates additional shear load.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;According to the results of experimental research, a method of prevention
    of cascade-type emergencies related to landfill landslides at the landfill with
    liquid energy-intensive technological equipment has been developed to prevent
    the consequences of danger from escalating from site to higher levels of distribution.
    The method consists of measures &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; the fact
    of moving the landslide.&lt;/p&gt;'
