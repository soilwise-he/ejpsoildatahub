  title: Soil Erosion Research On Determining The Extent Of The Potential Dangers
    Of Mountain-Brown Soils Of The Quba-Khachmaz Zone Of Azebajdzhan
  abstract: On the plots under sowing of field crops traits for which you can define
    the degree of soil erosion are projective cover and height plants. Enthusiastically
    steepness of slopes the ability to use crops as indicators of soil erosion reduces
    soil erosion degree of natural grassland can be estimated based on existing dependencies
    between the grass plants and extent of soil erosion. Strong enough erosion degree
    soils of sloping meadows can be recognized for environmental regimes of vegetation
    habitats.
