  title: A Geographical Study of Soil Types and Distribution of Settlement in Solapur
    District
  abstract: "There are many important physical factors which are influencing the distribution\
    \ of settlement are relief, availability of water, climate, soil, rainfall, availability\
    \ of cultivated land etc. \u201CSettlement geography is a science of systematic\
    \ inquiry of occupancy features distributed over space with differentiation in\
    \ relation to man\u201D (Mandal, 1970). Settlement responds to man\u2019s environment\
    \ as well as the religious and social customs of the society. Rural settlements\
    \ are the important aspect of settlement and human geography, as they reflect\
    \ the complex relationship of human occupation to land and environment. The study\
    \ of settlement is basic to human geography, because the form of settlement in\
    \ any region reflects men\u2019s relationship with the environment. The settlement\
    \ distribution is not only determined by the natural condition but other several\
    \ factors also influence the distribution of settlements such as physiography,\
    \ drainage pattern, population and other <strong>several</strong> factors. The\
    \ settlement is a basic administrative unit. The settlements with number of clusters\
    \ or hamlets are divided from each other by parcel of agricultural or other land\
    \ activities within a particular territorial unit. Settlement as an occupancy\
    \ unit, represents the organized colony of human beings including the building\
    \ in which they live or work or store their material. It also includes tracks\
    \ or streets over which their mobility takes place. Rural settlements are primary\
    \ settlement and it is related to primary economic activity. According to Stone\
    \ (1965) \u201CRural settlement geography is the description and analysis of the\
    \ distribution of building by which people attach themselves to the land for the\
    \ purpose of primary production.\u201D The people living in rural settlement are\
    \ mainly engaged in agriculture, fishing, raring animals, mining and forestry.\
    \ The rural settlement is made by local a material that is woods, vegetable matter,\
    \ mud and stone. The natural environment affects the characteristics of the settlement\
    \ in a particular region. Settlements are considered as an index of human adjustment\
    \ to the environment. The present research papers as an attempt to study soil\
    \ types and distribution of settlement in Solapur district. For that study rural\
    \ settlement in period 2011 has been taken into the consideration. The present\
    \ study is mainly based on the secondary data which is collected form the Census\
    \ Handbook of Solapur District and Socio-Economic Abstract of Solapur district."
