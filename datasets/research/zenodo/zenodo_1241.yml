  title: A survey of scale insects in soil samples from Europe (Hemiptera, Coccomorpha)
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, several expeditions were organized in Europe\
    \ by the researchers of the Hungarian Natural History Museum to collect snails,\
    \ aquatic insects and soil animals (mites, springtails, nematodes, and earthworms).\
    \ In this study, scale insect (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha) specimens extracted from\
    \ Hungarian Natural History Museum soil samples (2970 samples in total), all of\
    \ which were collected using soil and litter sampling devices, and extracted by\
    \ Berlese funnel, were examined. From these samples, 43 scale insect species (Acanthococcidae\
    \ 4, Coccidae 2, Micrococcidae 1, Ortheziidae 7, Pseudococcidae 21, Putoidae 1\
    \ and Rhizoecidae 7) were found in 16 European countries. In addition, a new species\
    \ belonging to the family Pseudococcidae, Brevennia larvalis Kaydan, sp. n. and\
    \ a new species of Ortheziidae, Ortheziola editae Szita &amp; Konczn\xE9 Benedicty,\
    \ sp. n. are described and illustrated based on the adult female stage. Revised\
    \ keys to the adult females of Brevennia and Ortheziola are presented.&lt;/p&gt;"
