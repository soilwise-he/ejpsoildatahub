  title: Soil Type and Management Effects on Organic Carbon Stocks and Soil Structure
    Quality in North Germany
  abstract: "Improvement of carbon sequestration in soils for a more sustainable environment\
    \ and prevention of climate change require not only knowledge about soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC) stocks, but also about interactions between land use and total\
    \ amount and distribution of carbon. In North Germany (state: Schleswig-Holstein)\
    \ about 925 soil profiles in the four dominant geological regions [Weichselian\
    \ glacial region, the sandy outwash region (Lower \u2015Geest\u2016), the Saalian\
    \ glacial region (Higher \u2015Geest\u2016), and the marshland with alluvial deposits]\
    \ were sampled down to at least the 90 cm depth. Carbon content, pH, bulk density,\
    \ and grain size distribution were analyzed for the major characteristic soil\
    \ horizons. The four dominant geological regions possess different SOC stocks\
    \ as well as SOC contents. The total amount of SOC stored within the representative\
    \ soil profiles down to the 90 cm depth was analyzed for three depths: 0 \u2013\
    \ 30, 30 \u2013 60, 60 \u2013 90 cm; for the total area of Schleswig Holstein\
    \ (15.369 km\xB2), they summed to 244 Mt. SOC stocks, however, differed depending\
    \ on the land use management system and clay content. Arable soils were most sensitive\
    \ to soil deformation and the higher the clay content the less rigid they were,\
    \ if the SOC to clay ratio were used as an index for structural quality. Grassland\
    \ topsoils showed the highest SOC stocks and a mediate structural quality. The\
    \ latter was highest for forest soils, which, however, had a higher SOC content\
    \ but, at the same time, a less fertile SOC composition (litter with high C: N\
    \ ratio). Further research on the carbon composition (labile, active, intermediate,\
    \ or passive pools) would help to get a better insight into the role of SOC on\
    \ soil strength and soil functions."
