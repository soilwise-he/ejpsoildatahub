  title: Heavy metal concentrations in soil from abandoned mining area in Barangay
    Baluno, Zamboanga City, Philippines
  abstract: "The study aimed to determine the extent of heavy metal contamination\
    \ of Copper (Cu) and Lead (Pb) in the soil from the abandoned mining area in Zamboanga\
    \ City, Philippines using the 2017 EMB Site Characterization Guidelines. Soil\
    \ samples were randomly collected from 3 meridional blocks at 2 different soil\
    \ depths, 0-5cm and 20-25cm. Pb and Cu concentrations, organic matter (OM) percentages,\
    \ pH and Electrical Conductivity (EC) were analyzed using appropriate equipment\
    \ across sampling sites. The study revealed that heavy metal content in Block\
    \ 3 exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations based on WHO standard with an\
    \ average mean of 3,351.00mgkg-1 Pb and 498.67mgkg-1 Cu at 20-25cm soil depth.\
    \ Moreover, at 0-5cm soil depth, Block 3 had 4176.33mgkg-1 Pb and 494.67mgkg-1\
    \ Cu. Furthermore, soil pH was strongly acidic across all blocks with values of\
    \ pH 5.0 at Block 1; pH 4.7 at Block 2 and pH 4.1 at Block 3. For EC and OM percentages,\
    \ results ranged from 183.33 \u03BCS/cm to 286.67 \u03BCS/cm and 1.81% to 4.05%,\
    \ respectively. Using Analysis of Variance at P < 0.05, this study further revealed\
    \ that there is a significant difference of Pb and Cu concentrations in 3 meridional\
    \ blocks at 0.001. This indicates that heavy metal concentrations present in the\
    \ soil varies in the 3 blocks. However, in physico-chemical parameters, only organic\
    \ matter has significant difference in all blocks at P \u22640.01. Based from\
    \ the findings, it is recommended that counter measures be undertaken to minimize\
    \ further retrogressive impacts of mine tailings left in the area specifically\
    \ in Block 3.\n\n\n\npublished by the \_Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental\
