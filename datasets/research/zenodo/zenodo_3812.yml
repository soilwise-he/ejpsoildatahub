  title: Runway Pavement Design of an International Airport using FAARFIELD Software
    and Stabilizing Subgrade Soil
  abstract: The growth of air transport is one of the remarkable developments and
    it is increasing day by day. Airport Authority of India (AAI) realized that its
    facilities at Sardar Patel International Airport at Hansol, Ahmedabad working
    beyond its capacity. Due to this need, Greenfield airport at Dholera Special Investment
    Region (SIR), Gujarat was proposed. This Research paper aims to design the airfield
    pavement for various alternatives using FAARFIELD software. In general, the soil
    type of Dholera region is fine grained and having CBR value less than 5. The need
    for soil subgrade improvement is prior to commencement for construction. So, the
    soil needs stabilization process to increase its strength. These processes include
    cement, lime, terrasil as stabilizing agent. Most effective combination is 2%
    cement and 0.06% terrasil which give optimum strength. Final design carried out
    using FAARFIELD software for (i) Flexible (ii) Rigid pavement. The thickness comparison
    for both with and without stabilization (2% cement and 0.06% Terrasil) was done.
    Cost comparison between with and without stabilization process is also given.
