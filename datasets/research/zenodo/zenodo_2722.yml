  title: Predicted mean soil depth of water uptake differs among crop species but
    does not change with increased crop diversity
  abstract: Water is a limiting resource in crop production and with the prediction
    that drought events increase in frequency and severity, drought-resilient crop
    production is one major challenge to ensure food security. Intercropping of different
    crop species, which show differences in hydrological niches, is one solution to
    reduce competition for water. In this study, the soil depth of water uptake of
    different crop species was investigated and how these water uptake patterns change
    with increasing crop diversity. Stable isotope analyses of soil and plant water
    was used to predict mean soil depth of water uptake of the different crop species.
    Results show that soil depth of water uptake differs among crop species but is
    not changed by crop diversity. The choice of intercrops with distinguishable hydrological
    niches can be important in water-limited crop production.
