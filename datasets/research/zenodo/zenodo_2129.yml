  title: "Rapid assessment of soil health in cocoa landscapes around T\xE9n\xE9 Forest\
    \ Reserve, Middle-West C\xF4te d'Ivoire"
  abstract: "The study was conducted within and around the Classified Forest of T\xE9\
    n\xE9 in the middle-west region of C\xF4te d'Ivoire, with the aim of providing\
    \ guidance for interventions that focus on developing resilient cocoa-forest landscapes.\
    \ Two specific landscapes, Mafia and Petit Bouak\xE9, were selected for analysis.\
    \ These landscapes are located in settlements where cocoa growers reside, close\
    \ to Goulikao in the Oum\xE9 district. The selected landscapes shared similar\
    \ land-use patterns, including secondary forests, 26-year-old cocoa plantations,\
    \ 13-year-old teak plantations, and recurrent fallow-maize fields of 5-year-old.\
    \ To assess soil health, several key metrics were measured at three different\
    \ soil depths: 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm. The metrics included soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC), pH-H20, and Mean Weight Diameter (MWD). The following key findings\
    \ were observed: (i) most sampling plots exhibited SOC concentrations below the\
    \ sustainable threshold of 20 kg ha-1 required for cocoa farming when the soil\
    \ pH values fell within the suitable range of 5.5-7.5 ; (ii) SOC concentrations\
    \ and stocks can serve as indicators of soil health deterioration in the top 10\
    \ cm of soil within cocoa landscapes, due to their sensitivity to land-use changes\
    \ and MWD can be used as an indicator in the depth increments of 10-20 cm and\
    \ 20-30 cm ; (iii) apart from maize fields, which are recognized as the most degraded\
    \ system within the landscape, soil health can be restored over a decade or more\
    \ beneath teak and cocoa plantations ; (iv) teak plantations demonstrated a potential\
    \ soil organic storage rate of +0.476 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the top 30 cm, supporting\
    \ the validity of the 4 per 1,000 theory. Therefore, teak plantations can be recommended\
    \ as a land-use option to combat global warming. In cocoa orchards, the carbon\
    \ storage capacity varied from +0.16 to +0.54 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, with an overall\
    \ carbon storage rate of +0.094 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the top 30 cm of soil. This\
    \ finding highlights the potential of cocoa agroforestry to enhance SOC storage\
    \ and suggests its use as a viable option for mitigating CO2 emissions, as advocated\
    \ by the Paris Agreement (COP 21). Implementing good agricultural practices that\
    \ focus on improved soil health, in conjunction with cocoa agroforestry that integrates\
    \ farmer-preferred trees, should form the foundation of a new cocoa cropping model\
    \ in the areas surrounding forest reserves.\nKeywords: Carbon sequestration, 4\
