  title: Avicelase Production By A Thermophilic Geobacillus Stearothermophilus Isolated
    From Soil Using Sugarcane Bagasse
  abstract: "Studies were carried out on the comparative study of the production of\
    \ Avicelase enzyme using sugarcane bagasse-SCB in two different statuses (i.e.\
    \ treated and untreated SCB) by thermophilic Geobacillus stearothermophilus at\
    \ 50\xBAC. Only four thermophilic bacterial isolates were isolated and assayed\
    \ for Avicelase production using UntSCB and TSCB. Only one isolate selected as\
    \ most potent and identified as G. stearothermophilus used in this study. A specific\
    \ endo-\u03B2-1,4-D-glucanase (Avicelase EC 3.2.1.91) was partially purified from\
    \ a thermophilic bacterial strain was isolated from different soil samples when\
    \ grown on cellulose enrichment SCB substrate as the sole carbon source. Results\
    \ shown that G. stearothermophilus was the better Avicelase producer strain. Avicelase\
    \ had an optimum pH and temperature 7.0 and 50\xBAC for both UntSCB and TSCB and\
    \ exhibited good pH stability between \"5-8\" and \"4-9\", however, good temperature\
    \ stability between (30-80\xBAC) for UntSCB and TSCB, respectively. Other factors\
    \ affecting the production of Avicelase were compared (i.e. SCB concentration,\
    \ inoculum size and different incubation periods), all results observed and obtained\
    \ were revealed that the TSCB was exhibited maximal enzyme activity in comparison\
    \ with the results obtained from UntSCB, so, the TSCB was enhancing the Avicelase\
    \ production."
