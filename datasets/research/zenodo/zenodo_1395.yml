  title: 'Evaluation of Antagonistic Potential of Soil Bacteria against Plant Pathogenic
    Fungus: Aspergillus niger'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil bacteria are able to synthesize a wide range of metabolites\
    \ with fungicidal activity. Nine bacterial isolates were obtained from the botanical\
    \ garden of university of Calabar. Preliminary examination of isolates was carried\
    \ out using morphological characteristics and Gram\u2019s reaction. These isolates\
    \ were designated with codes SB1, SB2, SB3, SB4, SB5, SB6, SB7, and SB8. Bacterial\
    \ isolates were evaluated for their potential of antagonism against &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus\
    \ niger&lt;/em&gt; isolated from spoiled vegetables like tomatoes by using agar\
    \ diffusion technique. Percentage inhibition of mycelial growth by these isolates\
    \ recorded values as 27%, 0%, 66%, 40%, 97%, 0% and 23% respectively. Isolates\
    \ were analyzed through several biochemical tests and were identified as &lt;em&gt;Bacillus\
    \ sp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterobacter spp&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas\
    \ spp&lt;/em&gt;., &lt;em&gt;Proteus spp.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;,\
    \ &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus spp.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus spp.&lt;/em&gt;\
    \ respectively. These result indicated that bacterial species exhibited varying\
    \ degree of antagonism against the fungus &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;.\
    \ &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; showed maximum inhibitory potential against\
    \ tested fungus with reduction of up to 97% in their fungal growth. &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas\
    \ spp.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacillus spp.&lt;/em&gt; followed with 66.7%.\
    \ This result showed that &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas spp.&lt;/em&gt; and Bacillus &lt;em&gt;spp.&lt;/em&gt;\
    \ exhibited similar percentage of antagonism against &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;.\
    \ From the results obtained, it can be interpreted that test bacterial species\
    \ can be used as fungal agents like &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;.\_\
