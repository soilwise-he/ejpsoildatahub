  title: Optimization Analysis of Heavy Equipment Combination in the Soil Pilot Project,
    Viewed From the Time and Cost of the Bendo Building Development Project in Ponorogo
    District, East Java
  abstract: '<pre><em>Bendo Dam is one of the dams proposed in the Bengawan Solo River
    Basin Development Project Master Plan in 1974. The construction of the Bendo Dam
    is one of the efforts to develop the Ponorogo Regency which is related to the
    development of water resources, to meet various community needs such as irrigation
    water supply, domestic raw water, and industry as well as flood control and tourism.</em></pre>
    <pre><em>For the analysis of optimizing the combination of heavy equipment in
    a landfill project, productivity and number of heavy equipment are calculated
    and making several types of heavy equipment combinations with different types
    and types. The combination is Combination I, Combination II, Combination III,
    Combination IV.</em></pre> <pre><em>Based on the calculation of heavy equipment
    productivity, the most effective and efficient combination is Combination IV because
    in this combination the costs incurred are relatively smaller than using other
    combinations. It can be seen from the productivity and the number of each heavy
    equipment as follows: Excavator 0.93 m3 (PC-200) 36 units 14 days, 12 m3 Dump
    Truck 227 units 14 days, Bulldozer 155 Hp (D68) 5 units 13 days, Roller BW-141
    72 units 14 days. The most efficient total cost to complete the Bendo Dam embankment
    project work is: Rp. 21,611,921,049</em></pre>'
