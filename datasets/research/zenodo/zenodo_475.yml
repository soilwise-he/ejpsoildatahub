  title: Soil microbiome analysis in an ESCA diseased vineyard
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The soil microbiome is linked to the microbial ecosystem of
    aboveground plant tissues and it is able to modulate and stimulate plant responses.
    The community composition, i.e. diversity and abundance, is influenced by several
    factors such as agronomical practices, agrochemical practices and geographical
    location. For the first time, we present here the investigation of the microbial
    community related to the soil of a long-established cultivated vineyard using
    the meta-barcoding approach. Specifically, we analyzed the bacterial and fungal
    communities of the bulk soils associated with esca-symptomatic and asymptomatic
    vines. Results showed no significant differences in richness between the two types
    of samples. Conversely, we observed that esca-related pathogens and grapevine
    trunk disease (GTD) pathogens were more abundant in the bulk soils of symptomatic
    plants, suggesting that the soil could represent an important source of inoculum.
    We also identified two fungal genera, Curvularia and Coprinopsis, which are exclusive
    to the soil associated with asymptomatic plants. Moreover, Actinobacteria, a well-known
    group of bacteria symbionts, are over-represented in asymptomatic soils. Further
    studies are needed to expand the knowledge about these microorganisms, since they
    could have a role in controlling the development and/or spread of esca pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;'
