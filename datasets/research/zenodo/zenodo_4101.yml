  title: Experimental Study on Black Cotton Soil to be used as Filling Material by
    Strengthning with Bagasse Ash and Brick Dust
  abstract: Soil stabilization deals with physical, physicchemical and chemical methods
    to ensure that the stabilized soil service its intended purpose as a pavement
    component material. Soil stabilization is the process of altering the qualities
    of soil (Index &amp; Engineering) in order to improve its performance. The black
    cotton soil various civil engineering application will be for example pavement
    designs, structural designs, structural buildings likewise. The black cotton soil
    is an expansive soil. That is the reason it can observe water and change the volume.
    Not only changing volume, it can also show swelling and shrinkage. This is the
    reason structures will damage. The failure due to settlement of soil, if soil
    settles foundation support will be sinking, the structure will be fail. In this
    present experimentation is with Bagasse Ash (BA) and Brick Dust (BD). The experimentation
    focused on physical properties of soil, compressive strength test, unconfined
    compressive strength test, California bearing ratio test and free swell test.
    In this experimentation with and without adding additives, compare with those
    two randomly adding percentages 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% brick dust. Bagasse ash is
    contently 4%. These experimentations shows clearly difference of the strength
    of soil. And this experiments result concludes bagasse ash and brick dust is good
    stabilization materials for black cotton soil.
