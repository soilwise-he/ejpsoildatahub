  title: Some distribution peculiarities of heavy metals mobile forms in the soil
    of ore mining region under various vegetative associations
  abstract: Some regularities of distribution of the mobile forms of iron, manganese,
    zinc in soils adjacent to the Northern ore mining-and-processing integrated works
    (Kryvbass) under various vegetative associations (steppe cenoses, forest shelter
    belts, agrophytocenoses) have been investigated. It was established, that the
    wood vegetation causes accumulation of all metals in soils. The intensity of this
    process amplifies with depth, i. e. their migration outside the limits of the
    soil profile takes place. Agrophytocenoses cause accumulation of manganese and
    iron and leaching of zinc.
