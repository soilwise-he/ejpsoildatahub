  title: 'Degradation of organic pollutants combining plasma discharges generated
    within soil with TiO2 and ZnO catalysts: Comparative analysis, optimization and
    mechanisms'
  abstract: "An advantageous plasma-catalytic setup was developed and applied towards\
    \ the degradation of trifluralin in soil. For the first time, TiO2\_and ZnO catalysts\
    \ were compared when employed in conjunction with micro-discharges generated directly\
    \ into the interconnected soil channels. In the presence of catalysts, a significant\
    \ increase in degradation efficiency was observed; after 5\_min, trifluralin degradation\
    \ increased from 66.5% (plasma alone) to 94.2% and 93% with the addition of TiO2\_\
    and ZnO, respectively. In terms of degradation kinetics, TiO2\_was a slightly\
    \ superior catalyst compared to ZnO whereas both catalysts performed better under\
    \ oxygen than in air atmosphere. Compared to plasma alone, the plasma-catalytic\
    \ treatment considerably increased (\u223C3fold) the process energy efficiency.\
    \ Moreover, the inhibitory effect of soil moisture was less pronounced during\
    \ TiO2\_plasma-catalysis where a reduction of\_\u223C19% in pollutant degradation\
    \ was observed at 5\_wt% soil moisture compared to a\_\u223C54% reduction during\
    \ plasma alone. The addition of TiO2\_and ZnO resulted in a significant increase\
    \ in NO2\_concentration and a noticeable reduction in O3 generation associated\
    \ with an increase of certain plasma species concentration and the generation\
    \ of additional and more active ROS, respectively. Liquid chromatography (UPLC/MS)\
    \ data at the early stages of the trifluralin degradation revealed similar intermediates\
    \ and degradation processes between plasma-alone and plasma-catalysis. The present\
    \ effort supports the potential of future implementation of a plasma-catalytic\
    \ soil remediation method being a rapid, highly efficient, low energy demanding\
    \ and green method."
