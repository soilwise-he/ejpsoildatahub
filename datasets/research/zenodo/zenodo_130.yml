  title: Soil Pollution and Environmental Health
  abstract: 'Soil plays a crucial role in sustainable economic and social development,
    impacting both human health and the construction process. Soil protection is vital
    to support ecological progress and ensure domestic ecological safety. Soil pollution
    occurs when toxic chemicals, known as pollutant are present in the soil at concentrations
    that pose risks to human health and the ecosystem. Soil degradation is a significant
    issue, affecting all aspects of the country and representing a major weakness
    in construction. All soils, whether polluted or unpolluted, naturally contain
    various compounds known as contaminants. These contaminants include metals, inorganic
    ions, salts, and organic compounds, which are primarily formed through microbial
    activity and the decomposition of organisms in the soil. Additionally, substances
    from the atmosphere, such as precipitation water, wind activity, soil disturbances,
    surface water bodies, and shallow groundwater, can introduce various compounds
    into the soil. When the levels of these contaminants exceed natural levels, soil
    pollution occurs. The consequences of soil pollution include vegetation loss,
    hindered plant growth and development, and the eventual degradation of soil leading
    to erosion and desertification. Soil pollution can stem from two main causes:
    anthropogenic (human-made) causes and natural causes. This chapter explores the
    causes and effects of soil pollution, focusing on both human activities and naturally
    occurring pollutants. It also discusses measures for preventing and controlling
    soil pollution.'
