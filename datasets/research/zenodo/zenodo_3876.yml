  title: A STUDY ON COPPER SLAG AS REPLACEMENT OF FINE AGGREGATE WITH ADDITION OF
    RED SOIL.
  abstract: This paper reports an experimental program to investigate the effect of
    using copper slag as a complete 100% replacement of sand on the property of fine
    aggregate. Addition of red soil in ratio 0%, 5%, 10% in cement.M25 mix design
    has been used. Concrete mixes were evaluated for compressive strength and split
    tensile strength. With two different composition of 7 days and 28 days. This result
    indicates that the 10% addition of red soil to cementand 100% replacement of copper
    slag show the greater results in both split tensile strength and compressive strength
    than compared to the conventional concrete. Whereas the addition of 5% red soil
    to cement causes the result in reduction of compressive strength and split tensile
    strength, however it shows the greater result when compared to the conventional
    concrete.
