  title: Liming Effects on Yield and Yield Components of Haricot Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris
    L.) Varieties Grown in Acidic Soil at Damot Sore District, Southern Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A field experiment was conducted at location&nbsp; Damot Sore
    in Wolaita Zone, Southern Nations Nationalities and People&rsquo;s Regional State
    (SNNPRS) to evaluate the response of varieties haricot bean (&lt;em&gt;Phaseolus
    vulgaris&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;L.) with two rates of lime ( 0 and 0.4 tha-1 CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
    used on acidic soils The treatments were arranged in factorial RCBD with three
    replications. Analysis resulted of soil samples showed that Organic carbon, Availability
    phosphorus, Total nitrogen and Soil pH values were very low. Application of lime
    resulted in significant changes on these chemical properties of the soils in the
    location. Availability of P and soil pH was improved due to the application of
    lime and maximum values of these parameters were recorded. Growth parameters,
    yield and yield components were significantly increased with increasing rates
    of liming at the location (year1&amp;2). Maximum grain yields 1282.49 kgha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;for
    Hawasa Dume at Gununo and 1079.40&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;for Omo-95&nbsp;
    were recorded&nbsp; with rates of 20 kgPha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;with
    lime (0.4 tha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) at&nbsp; location. From the result of
    this study it could be conclude that liming improve soil pH,&nbsp; Availability
    phosphorus&nbsp; and performance of haricot bean varieties but till now there
    is some gap on correcting acidity of the soils and also grain yield of the varieties.
    So application of lime should be repeated in the coming season until soil comes
    to neutral and increased the production of the crops.&lt;/p&gt;'
