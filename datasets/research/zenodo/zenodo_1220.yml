  title: Analysis Of Changes In Soil Volumetric Water Content Using Common-Offset
    Gpr
  abstract: In highway engineering, GPR is a nondestructive tool for prediction pavement
    layers conditions, the quality of subgrade soils, and assessing other pavement
    conditions, such as moisture-related pavement damage. From the reflected GPR wave
    information, dielectric properties of the materials, which are highly dependent
    on soil or aggregate-water-air systems, can be estimated. An increase in dielectric
    constant may indicate an increase in moisture content of dielectric materials.
    However, the relationship between dielectric value and moisture content is complex
    and controlled by many factors. GPR studies, which consider both real and imaginary
    parts of dielectric value and its frequency dependent behavior, have shown potentials
    for developing more robust model to predict moisture content. This paper presents
    an overview of ground coupled GPR capabilities in estimating water content that
    is necessary in assessing pavement condition. Two types of antennas (800 and 500
    MHz) were employed to decide the best monitoring for the water seepage under new
    or existing pavements. As well as, the data outcomes will be presented with the
    necessary data filtration and post processing softwares to observe spectrums behavior
    during the wetting cycles. Finally, it is concluded that estimation of soil water
    content using Common-Offset GPR measurements mode facilitates rapid data acquisition.
