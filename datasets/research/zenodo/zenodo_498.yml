  title: Microwave Remote Sensing Properties of Soil in India
  abstract: "In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze microwave remote sensing\
    \ dielectric behaviour of soil in India. A researcher may research any part of\
    \ the world but it has been seen from literature review more or less 15-20 states\
    \ are in well position to recognize in the field of microwave remote sensing dielectric\
    \ behaviour viz : Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, J &amp; K, Uttar\
    \ Pradesh,Uttarakhand, Kerala, Gujarat, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,\
    \ Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab. A different study predicts that the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil at microwave frequencies are the function of its physico-chemical\
    \ constituents. The Physical capacities of a soil are influenced by the size,\
    \ proportion, arrangement and composition of the soil particles. <br> Microwave\
    \ remote, sensing techniques are now a day\u2019s widely adopted and used to estimate\
    \ the presence of natural resources underneath the ground surface. The present\
    \ study has been taken to have an idea of microwave remote sensing characteristics\
    \ of soil properties in agriculture for food purpose. These dielectric properties\
    \ can be used to predict the soil fertility and health. In this paper it has been\
    \ also discussed about microwave remote sensing characteristics of soil for agriculture.\
    \ The quality of soil is controlled by physical, chemical and biological components\
    \ of soil and their interactions. The soil has physical, chemical as well as electrical\
    \ properties, colour, texture, grain size, bulk density etc. comprise the physical\
    \ properties, nutrients, organic matter, pH, etc. comprise chemical properties\
    \ while, electrical properties include dielectric constant, electrical conductivity\
    \ and permeability. The concept of soil health and soil quality has consistently\
    \ evolved with an increase in the understanding of soils and soil quality attributes.\
    \ The dielectric constant of soil is dependent on the bulk density of soil and\
    \ hence porosity and wilting point of soil. The dielectric constant of Indian\
    \ soils is dependent on the texture of soil i.e. the percent content of sand,\
    \ silt and clay."
