  title: ESTIMATION OF SOIL EROSION USING REVISED UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION FOR
    HAROHALLI WATERSHED
  abstract: "Abstract\xAD- \n\n\n\_\n\nSoil erosion is the detachment and transportation\
    \ of soil materials from one place to another, resulting in the removal of the\
    \ uppermost fertile soil layer, thus decreasing its productivity. Soil erosion\
    \ was estimated by using Universal Soil Loss Equation in a GIS environment and\
    \ prioritization of catchments on that basis, the present study Harohalli watershed,\
    \ Kanakapura Taluk, Ramanagara District area was chosen since it falls in the\
    \ rocks and granite area. soil and slope maps were prepared from Survey of India\
    \ maps and NBSS & LUP maps and integrated into GIS database.\_ Soil\_ erosion\_\
    \ of\_ each\_ of\_ the\_ sub catchment\_ was estimated from the integrated map.\
    \ The sub catchments were prioritized based on the estimation of erosion. From\
    \ the study it can be inferred that soil erosion estimation using Remote Sensing\_\
    \ and\_ GIS\_ technique\_ can\_ be\_ effectively\_ used\_ for prioritization of\
    \ catchments and this helps in the way the catchments\_ can\_ be\_ taken\_ for\_\
    \ treatment\_ for\_ conservation measures. \n\nKeywords\_ \u2014 erosion, GIS,\
    \ prioritization, remote sensing, USLE"
