  title: Seismic Vulnerability Assessment of Critical Port Infrastructure Components
    by Modelling the Soil-Wharf-Crane Interaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; This paper aims to investigate
    the seismic vulnerability of key port infrastructure components by using the outcomes
    of advanced numerical analysis. For the first time, to the best knowledge of the
    authors, a pile-supported wharf structure, the soil deposits where the wharf lies,
    and a crane typically operating on the wharf are numerically modelled as a combined
    system. The starting point for building the numerical model is the main components
    of strategic facilities at the port of Gioia Tauro (Italy), which is a strategic
    hub for container traffic located in one of the most seismically active regions
    of the Mediterranean Sea. Based on the results obtained from two-dimensional (2D)
    dynamic analyses, fragility curves were developed for single port components and
    the wharf-crane-soil system. A scenario-based seismic damage assessment was then
    exemplified to compare the predictions resulting from the fragility model presented
    in this work with the relevant data available in the literature. It turns out
    that, besides some inevitable variations, expected damage percentages were in
    general agreement. As the main contribution of this work, derived fragility curves
    might be adopted as an effective tool for rapid evaluation of the seismic performance
    of port components during the development of strategies for risk mitigation and
    also the emergency management in case of an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;'
