  title: Determination of PAHs and BTEX in Soil and Crops (Cocoyam and Cassava) of
    Crude Oil Impacted Community, Mogho Gokana, Nigeria
  abstract: "The aim of this study is to determine the impact of crude oil spillage\
    \ on soil and harvested tuber crops (cocoyam and cassava) in Mogho Community.\
    \ Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene\
    \ (BTEX) were investigated using Gas Chromatography \u2013 Flame Ionization Detector.\
    \ Tuber crops and soils from crude oil impacted area of Mogho Community were used\
    \ as the sample; while soil not impacted by crude oil were collected from Bori\
    \ was used as the control. The results obtained for PAHs showed mean concentration\
    \ of 0.035mg/kg for polluted soil; 0.001mg/kg for cassava, and 0.005mg/kg for\
    \ cocoyam harvested from the polluted soil while the unpolluted soil (control)\
    \ had a mean concentration of 0.002mg/kg. The mean concentration of BTEX for the\
    \ samples was &lt;0.001 which is below detection limit. The presence of PAHs in\
    \ samples was found to be both low molecular weight and high molecular weight.\
    \ The PAHs found in the polluted soil was higher compared to that of the unpolluted\
    \ soil. The concentration of PAHs found in samples, exceeds the recommended permissible\
    \ limit of WHO standard, which is (0.0001mg/kg). These results reveal that crude\
    \ oil pollution is responsible for the presence of PAHs in soils and tuber crops\
    \ like cassava and cocoyam which are frequently consumed in our localities. Government\
    \ and oil companies should employ mitigating measures to deal with pipeline vandalization\
    \ and oil spillage in this area.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V82019042029\
