  title: Soil Carbon Storage in Silvopastoral Systems and a Treeless Pasture in Northwestern
    Spain
  abstract: "Soil particle size and land management practices are known to have considerable\
    \ infl uence on carbon (C) storage in soils, but such information is lacking for\
    \ silvopastoral systems in Spain. Th is study quantifi ed the amounts of soil\
    \ C stored at various depths to 100 cm under \n ilvopastoral plots of radiata\
    \ pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) and birch (Betula pendula Roth) in comparison to\
    \ treeless pasture in Galicia, Spain. Soils were fractionated into three size\
    \ classes (&lt;53, 53\u2013250, and 250\u20132000 \u03BCm), and C stored in them\
    \ and in the whole (nonfractionated) soil was determined. Overall, the C stock\
    \ to 1 m ranged from 80.9 to 176.9 Mg ha\u22121 in these soils. Up to 1 m depth,\
    \ 78.82% of C was found in the 0- to 25-cm soil depth, with 12.9, 4.92, and 3.36%\
    \ in the 25- to 50-, 50- to 75-, and 75- to 100-cm depths, respectively. Soils\
    \ under birch at 0 to 25 cm stored more C in the 250- to 2000-\u03BCm size class\
    \ as compared with those under \n adiata pine; at that depth, pasture had more\
    \ C than pine silvopasture in the smaller soil fractions (&lt;53 and 53\u2013\
    250 \u03BCm). In the 75- to 100-cm depth, there was signifi cantly more storage\
    \ of C in the 250- to 2000-\u03BCm fraction in both silvopastures as compared\
    \ with the pasture. Th e higher storage of soil C in larger fraction size in lower\
    \ soil depths of silvopasture suggests that planting of trees into traditional\
    \ agricultural landscapes will promote longer-term storage of C in the soil."
