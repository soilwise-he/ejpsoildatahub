  title: The Effect of Controlled Tile Drainage on Growth and Grain Yield of Spring
    Barley as Detected by UAV Images, Yield Map and Soil Moisture Content
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Controlled tile drainage (CTD) practices are a promising tool
    for improving water balance, water quality and increasing crop yield by raising
    shallow groundwater level and capillary rise due to drainage flow retardation.
    We tested the effect of CTD on growth and grain yield of spring barley, at a study
    site in central Bohemia using vegetation indices from unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) imagery and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Tile drainage flow was slowed
    by fixed water level control structures that increased soil moisture in the surrounding
    area according to the terrain slope. Vegetation indices based on red-edge spectral
    bands in combination with near-infrared and red bands were selected, of which
    the Normalized Red Edge-Red Index (NRERI) showed the closest relationships with
    shoot biomass parameters (dry biomass, nitrogen concentration and uptake, nitrogen
    nutrition index) from point sampling at the tillering stage. The CTD sites showed
    significantly more biomass using NRERI compared to free tile drainage (FTD) sites.
    In contrast, in the period prior to the implementation of CTD practices, Sentinel-2
    satellite imagery did not demonstrate higher biomass based on NRERI at CTD sites
    compared to FTD sites. The grain yields of spring barley as determined from the
    yield map also increased due to CTD (by 0.3 t/ha, i.e., by 4%). The positive impact
    of CTD on biomass development and grain yield of spring barley was confirmed by
    the increase in soil moisture at depths of 20, 40 and 60 cm compared to FTD. The
    largest increase in soil water content of 3.5 vol% due to CTD occurred at the
    depth of 40 cm, which also had a higher degree of saturation of available water
    capacity and the occurrence of crop water stress was delayed by 14 days compared
    to FTD.&lt;/p&gt;'
