  title: Structural Analysis of Multistoried Building with different soil conditions
  abstract: '<em>According to the current version of the IS: 1893-2002, practically
    all multi-story buildings must be examined as three-dimensional systems. Buildings
    can be conceptualised as having symmetrical mass, stiffness, and layout. Using
    the most latest software, STAAD Pro, the research will assess and compare the
    seismic response of a G+15 story RCC frame structure with different soil conditions
    (Hard, Medium, and Soft soil) for seismic Zone IV. The structural and seismic
    properties of Models M1, M2, and M3 are identical, with the exception of the type
    of soil. The models are seismically evaluated using the Equivalent Static method
    utilising the STAAD Pro V8i software. The model''s response is examined using
    the maximum storey displacement, base shear, and story drift. The purpose of the
    study is to assess the stability of the three models in diverse soil type scenarios.
    Reaction spectrum analysis (RSA) on common RC construction frames with different
    soil types is the project''s main objective. The results of the analysis for typical
    constructions both with and without seismic impacts will be compared.</em>'
