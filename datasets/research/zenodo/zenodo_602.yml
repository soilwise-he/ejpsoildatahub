  title: Analysis Of Pile Foundation Behaviour For Various Soil Condition
  abstract: 'Pile foundation is used to transfer the ultimate load from the structure
    to the foundation from soft soil strata to hard soil or rock. FEA model developed
    to predict the response of pile in static and nonlinear dynamic analysis of pile
    foundation in layered soil medium based on field data. In the first step static
    analysis will be performed which were compared and validated with the analytical
    result. Pile foundation are carried for the various soil condition in order to
    prove its efficiency in the soil systems.


    Numerical analysis has been carried out using FEA (NASTRAN) software, which will
    be used to give load-displacement, stresses and response at pile. 20 node 3D element
    used to model the pile, biased meshing will be used toward the pile to produce
    accurate result in the region of interest. These stresses on the pile will be
    predicted using the finite element method. FE methodology is more precise in predicting
    the strength of the piles and foundations.'
