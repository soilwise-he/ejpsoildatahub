  title: A comparative study on vegetation cover, soil properties and status of Arbuscular
    Mycorrhizal Fungi in Jhum fallow and Natural Forest in Arunachal Pradesh
  abstract: Deforestation in the form of shifting agriculture is one of the biggest
    threats to the forests in Northeast India. Such disturbances adversely affect
    the vegetation, soil health and the below-ground microorganisms especially Arbuscular
    Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF). The present study investigated the impact of conversion
    of a tropical forest area into a Jhum field on vegetation cover, soil physico-chemical
    properties and the below ground AMF status in Papum Pare district of Arunachal
    Pradesh. Sampling was done by belt transect method covering 4 plots of 10,000
    m2 size. Vegetation cover, Tree Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), soil physico-chemical
    properties, root colonization (RC), AMF inoculum potential (IP), spore population
    (SP) and AMF diversity in composite soil samples were quantified. The vegetation
    cover in the Natural Forest was more than the Jhum fallows with greater plant
    diversity, tree density, canopy cover, and DBH. Soil pH, Organic Carbon, available
    Nitrogen and available Phosphorus content in the soil differed significantly between
    the sites. RC (66.67%), IP (1.58 g-1 soil) and SP (224 AMF spores 100 g-1) were
    higher in the Natural Forest. The study showed that removal of above-ground vegetation
    exerts negative impacts on the soil properties and AMF status.
