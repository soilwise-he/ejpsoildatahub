  title: 'Roman coins at the edge of the Negev: characterisation of copper alloy artefacts
    and soil from Rakafot 54 (Beer Sheva, Israel)'
  abstract: The research presented in this paper focused on the preliminary non- and
    semi-destructive analysis of copper alloys, corrosion, and soil components from
    a Roman archaeological site in Israel. Investigations using portable X-ray fluorescence,
    X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy
    as well as micromorphological analyses were carried out to gain a better understanding
    of the corrosion processes affecting the copper alloy artefacts, by characterising
    the alloy composition, soil environments, and corrosion products. Preliminary
    results indicate that the artefacts consist of copper-lead-tin alloys, covered
    by copper hydroxy-chlorides and lead sulphate phases with slight variations in
    their crystallisation. The multi-analytical approach revealed the presence of
    quartz, calcite, gypsum and feldspars in the sediments, while thin sections more
    specifically indicate loess soils with local micro-environments.
