  title: An Appraisal Of Coal Fly Ash Soil Amendment Technology (Fasat) Of Central
    Institute Of Mining And Fuel Research (Cimfr)
  abstract: 'Coal will continue to be the predominant source of

    global energy for coming several decades. The huge generation of fly

    ash (FA) from combustion of coal in thermal power plants (TPPs) is

    apprehended to pose the concerns of its disposal and utilization. FA

    application based on its typical characteristics as soil ameliorant for

    agriculture and forestry is the potential area, and hence the global

    attempt. The inferences drawn suffer from the variations of ash

    characteristics, soil types, and agro-climatic conditions; thereby

    correlating the effects of ash between various plant species and soil

    types is difficult. Indian FAs have low bulk density, high water

    holding capacity and porosity, rich silt-sized particles, alkaline

    nature, negligible solubility, and reasonable plant nutrients. Findings

    of the demonstrations trials for more than two decades from lab/pot

    to field scale long-term experiments are developed as FA soil

    amendment technology (FASAT) by Central Institute of Mining and

    Fuel Research (CIMFR), Dhanbad. Performance of different crops

    and plant species in cultivable and problematic soils, are

    encouraging, eco-friendly, and being adopted by the farmers. FA

    application includes ash alone and in combination with

    inorganic/organic amendments; combination treatments including

    bio-solids perform better than FA alone. Optimum dose being up to

    100 t/ha for cultivable land and up to/ or above 200 t/ha of FA for

    waste/degraded land/mine refuse, depending on the characteristics of

    ash and soil. The elemental toxicity in Indian FA is usually not of

    much concern owing to alkaline ashes, oxide forms of elements, and

    elemental concentration within the threshold limits for soil

    application. Combating toxicity, if any, is possible through

    combination treatments with organic materials and phytoremediation.

    Government initiatives through extension programme

    involving farmers and ash generating organizations need to be

    accelerated'
