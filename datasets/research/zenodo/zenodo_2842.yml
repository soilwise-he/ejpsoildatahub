  title: Apophysomyces thailandensis (Mucorales, Mucoromycota), a new species isolated
    from soil in northern Thailand and its solubilization of non-soluble minerals
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A new species of soil fungi, described herein as Apophysomyces
    thailandensis, was isolated from soil in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Morphologically,
    this species was distinguished from previously described Apophysomyces species
    by its narrower trapezoidal sporangiospores. A physiological determination showed
    that A. thailandensis differs from other Apophysomyces species by its assimilation
    of D-turanose, D-tagatose, D-fucose, L-fucose, and nitrite. A phylogenetic analysis,
    performed using combined internal transcribed spacers (ITS), the large subunit
    (LSU) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions, and a part of the histone 3 (H3) gene,
    lends support to our the finding that A. thailandensis is distinct from other
    Apophysomyces species. The genetic distance analysis of the ITS sequence supports
    A. thailandensis as a new fungal species. A full description, illustrations, phylogenetic
    tree, and taxonomic key to the new species are provided. Its metal minerals solubilization
    ability is reported.&lt;/p&gt;'
