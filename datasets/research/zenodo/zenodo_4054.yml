  title: Ftir, Xrd,Sem/Edax Analysis Of Coastal Soil Samples Of Kanyakumari District
    In Full Moon And New Moon Day.
  abstract: Beaches are one of the important land forms and the most important feature
    of coastal morphology. Coastal soil samples contain the most economically important
    mineral accumulations. The total land mass of the earth we can live only on 30%
    of our planet. Our survival is threatened the non-biodegradable wastes were accumulated
    in the coastal region. Accumulation of non-biodegradable wastes also affects tides.
    Tides are one of the most important phenomena in the world they move in and out
    around twice a day. However, full moon and new moon day also affect the sea level
    and may cause both higher and lower tides. In this present study, concentrated
    the variation of coastal soil samples of kanyakumari district in full moon and
    new moon day. The qualitative identification of minerals were carried out by using
    FTIR and XRD techniques. The observed XRD patterns indicate quartz, feldspar,
    calcite, kaolinite, hematite and illite. SEM image of coastal soil sample was
    taken at 20kv with different magnification shows different morphology. Mineralogical
    studies in FTIR and XRD confirm the variation of minerals in full moon and new
    moon day. In FTIR study the absorption frequencies of the peak and band tentative
    assignments are different in full moon and new moon day. Elemental composition
    study i.e. EDAX clearly shown the elemental variations in full moon and new moon
    day. Morphological study (SEM) clearly showed the different structure in different
    magnification.
