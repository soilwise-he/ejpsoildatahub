  title: Evaluation of soil bacteria treatments on some physiological parameters of
    crops by spectral vegetation indices
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The effects of soil bacteria treatments on barley and wheat
    (1. treatment: stubble decomposers + soil inoculators; 2. stubble decomposers
    + soil regenerators; 3. control) were studied at the Agricultural Research Institute
    in Kompolt on spectral vegetation indices which are closely related to photochemical
    processes and photosynthetic pigments in barley and wheat leaves. We applied&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;in
    vivo&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;field measurements: SPAD 502 relative chlorophyll meter and
    ASD Field Spec Pro 3 spectroradiometer. This work presents the results of the
    experiments in 2019, moreover, we compared them with our previously published
    investigations on several other crops (maize, sunflower, rape, barley) carried
    out in 2017 and 2018. In 2019 despite the significant level of the standard deviation
    of data in field conditions, treated (mainly with stubble decomposers + soil inoculators)
    wheat leaves could be characterized by significantly higher chlorophyll and water
    content, higher photochemical efficiency, and lower carotenoid content. In the
    case of barley due to the large standard deviation of data, we couldn&rsquo;t
    reveal the beneficial effects of treatments by these methods. Due to the very
    rainy spring in 2019 some experimental plots - like K9 with barley &ndash; wre
    covered by inland water, which negatively influenced living conditions of soil
    bacteria. Despite this unfavourable conditions, the first treatment resulted in
    an 18.9% higher yield of barley and 27.8% higher yield of wheat, while the second
    treatment increased barley yield with 28.9% and wheat yield with 27.7%. In the
    case of wheat, spectral vegetation indices could indicate beneficial effects of
    soil bacteria treatments at the beginning of flowering, similarly to our results
    in 2017 and 2018 in case of maize, sunflower, rape, and barley.&lt;/p&gt;'
