  title: IMPACT ON SOIL FERTILITY GROWING OF ASSOCIATED CROPS MASH AND SOYBEAN ON
    LOW-FERTILITY SOILS FOR COTTON GROWING
  abstract: In this article, in the conditions of light gray soils of the Syrdarya
    region, fertilization is applied at the rate of H-200, R-140, K-100 kg per hectare
    when cultivating two crops from one field. effects on generalization have been
