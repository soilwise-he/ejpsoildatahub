  title: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PARAMETER OF SOIL IN NON IRRIGATED
    AND IRRIGATED (WELL OR CANAL) FIELD AREAS AROUND BIKANER CITY RAJASTHAN
  abstract: 'The most vital and essential common asset is soil. The production of
    the sustenance to meet the requirements of people and animals is basically reliant
    upon agriculture which is dependent on soil. The word soil originated from Latin
    word Solum which means Flour. The soil is a dynamic natural body composed of minerals
    and organic material as well as living forms in which plant grow. Soil is the
    unconsolidated outer layer of Earths crust. Soils consist of four major components:
    mineral materials, organic matter, water, and air. The physical properties of
    a soil are important to determine the manner in which it can be used either for
    agricultural and non-agricultural purposes R. S. Meena and A. K. Mathur,2017 Properties
    viz. infiltration rate, water- holding capacity, permeability, aeration, plasticity
    and nutrient-supplying ability, are influenced by the size, proportion, arrangement
    and mineral composition of the soil particles.'
