  title: SOIL SERIES CHARACTERISTICS AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS AND YIELD IN THE SOILS OF
    BARAGAON BLOCK DISTRICT VARANASI (UTTAR PRADESH.)
  abstract: Soils are finite, precious and resources are shrinking. The nutrients
    control the productivity from the soils and manage the yields of crops. The Baragaon
    block of district Varanasi was selected for Land Resource Inventory on 1:10000
    Scales for optimal Agricultural Land Use Planning using geospatial techniques.
    Seven soils series were identified and Soil profile samples were collected and
    analyzed in laboratory for pH, EC, OC, Caco<sup>3</sup>, N, P, K, and micronutrients
    Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn. Soil samples were found low in organic carbon, available nitrogen
    and phosphorus while medium and high in potassium. All samples were found deficient
    in available sulphur. Significant positive correlations were found to exist between
    organic carbon and available N, P, K and S status in soil series of Baragaon Block
    of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh.
