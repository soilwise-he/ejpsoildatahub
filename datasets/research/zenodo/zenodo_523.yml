  title: 'Defining the biosecurity risk posed by transported soil: Effects of storage
    time and environmental exposure on survival of soil biota'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil frequently occurs as a contaminant on numerous sea, land\
    \ and air transport pathways. It can carry unwanted invasive species, is widely\
    \ recognized as a biosecurity risk, and is usually strictly regulated by biosecurity\
    \ authorities. However, little is known about relative risk levels between pathways,\
    \ thus authorities have limited capability to identify and target the riskiest\
    \ soil pathways for management. We conducted a an experiment to test the hypotheses\
    \ that biosecurity risks from soil organisms will increase both with declining\
    \ transport duration and with increasing protection from environmental extremes.\
    \ Soil was collected from two sites, a native forest remnant and an orchard, and\
    \ stored on, in and under sea containers, or in cupboards, and assayed after 0,\
    \ 3, 6 and 12 months for bacteria, fungi, nematodes and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n   \
    \     &lt;p&gt;Results showed that viability of Pseudomonas spp., bacteria, nematodes\
    \ and plants declined over 12 months, irrespective of soil source. Also, mortality\
    \ of most biota was higher when exposed to sunlight, moisture and desiccation\
    \ than when protected. However, bacterial and fungal numbers were higher in exposed\
    \ environments, possibly due to ongoing colonization of exposed soil by airborne\
    \ propagules. The results were consistent with our observations of organisms in\
    \ soil intercepted from airports and sea ports, and indicated there is potential\
    \ to rank risks from transported soils based partly on transport duration and\
    \ environmental exposure. This would help authorities to optimally allocate management\
    \ resources according to pathway-specific risks.&lt;/p&gt;"
