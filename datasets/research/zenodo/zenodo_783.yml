  title: Soil-Foundation-Structure Interaction Effects on urban scale Vulnerability
    Assessment
  abstract: Urban-scale seismic risk assessment is of paramount importance to identify
    the impact of future earthquakes in cities, to assist national authorities in
    risk mitigations policies as well as after seismic event emergency management.
    To date, a seismic risk assessment framework at a large scale is assessed considering
    a portfolio of fixed-base structures. It is rather clear that when structures
    rest on soft soil profiles the interaction between the soil, foundation, and structure
    (SSI) may arise. Including SSI effects in the city-scale vulnerability analysis
    may be challenging due to the high exposure concentration and complexity of the
    whole interacting system not to mention the limited amount of data on the foundation
    building inventory. For this reason, large-scale analyses are commonly carried
    out applying existing fragility curves which generally neglect SSI and may have
    been assessed for different soil conditions. A novel simplified methodology is
    proposed in this study to calculate fragility functions of structures considering
    the influence of SSI and local site-effects, suitable for large-scale application.
    An improved taxonomy defines the resulting fragility functions introducing the
    averaged shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m (VS,30) as a proxy for the site and
    SSI effects. The outcomes of the methodological framework are adopted to estimate
    the risk in terms of damages incurred by the most popular building classes of
    Thessaloniki, Northern Greece for the Thessaloniki 1978, Mw 6.5 historical earthquake.
    The main findings reported herein demonstrate that the conventional way of performing
    risk analysis may lead affect the seismic risk estimates by a substantial margin.
