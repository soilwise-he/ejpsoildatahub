  title: Soil Quality State And Trends In New Zealand'S Largest City After 15 Years
  abstract: "Soil quality monitoring is a science-based soil<br>\nmanagement tool\
    \ that assesses soil ecosystem health.<br>\nA soil monitoring program in Auckland,\
    \ New Zealand\u2019s largest<br>\ncity extends from 1995 to the present. The objective\
    \ of this study was<br>\nto firstly determine changes in soil parameters (basic\
    \ soil properties<br>\nand heavy metals) that were assessed from rural land in\
    \ 1995-2000<br>\nand repeated in 2008-2012. The second objective was to determine<br>\n\
    differences in soil parameters across various land uses including<br>\nnative\
    \ bush, rural (horticulture, pasture and plantation forestry) and<br>\nurban land\
    \ uses using soil data collected in more recent years (2009-<br>\n2013).<br>\n\
    Across rural land, mean concentrations of Olsen P had<br>\nsignificantly increased\
    \ in the second sampling period and was<br>\nidentified as the indicator of most\
    \ concern, followed by soil<br>\nmacroporosity, particularly for horticultural\
    \ and pastoral land. Mean<br>\nconcentrations of Cd were also greatest for pastoral\
    \ and horticultural<br>\nland and a positive correlation existed between these\
    \ two parameters,<br>\nwhich highlights the importance of analysing basic soil\
    \ parameters in<br>\nconjunction with heavy metals. In contrast, mean concentrations\
    \ of<br>\nAs, Cr, Pb, Ni and Zn were greatest for urban sites. Native bush sites<br>\n\
    had the lowest concentrations of heavy metals and were used to<br>\ncalculate\
    \ a \u2018pollution index\u2019 (PI). The mean PI was classified as high<br>\n\
    (PI &gt; 3) for Cd and Ni and moderate for Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu, As and Hg,<br>\nindicating\
    \ high levels of heavy metal pollution across both rural and<br>\nurban soils.\
    \ From a land use perspective, the mean \u2018integrated<br>\npollution index\u2019\
    \ was highest for urban sites at 2.9 followed by<br>\npasture, horticulture and\
    \ plantation forests at 2.7, 2.6 and 0.9,<br>\nrespectively.<br>\nIt is recommended\
    \ that soil sampling continues over time because<br>\na longer spanning record\
    \ will allow further identification of where<br>\nsoil problems exist and where\
    \ resources need to be targeted in the<br>\nfuture. Findings from this study will\
    \ also inform policy and science<br>\ndirection in regional councils."
