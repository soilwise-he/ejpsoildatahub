  title: Farmers' Perception Of Soil Fertility Decline Under Yam Production In Oyo
    State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Soil fertility is an important natural resource in agriculture and its\
    \ decline can have negative effects on farms\u2019 productivity. The study investigated\
    \ the perception of farmers on soil fertility decline under yam production in\
    \ Oyo state, Nigeria. Data were collected from two hundred and forty yam farmers\
    \ purposively selected for the study. Descriptive statistics of means, and percentages\
    \ were used to describe the data while correlation coefficients were employed\
    \ to determine the relationships. Appearance of gravel, stunted growth and yellowing\
    \ of leaves of crops and low yields were among the factors recognized by the farmers\
    \ to be the indicators of soil fertility decline under yam production Significant\
    \ ( p \u2264 0.05) and positive relationships were found to exist between farmers\u2019\
    \ perception of soil fertility decline and selected socio-economic characteristics\
    \ such as age (p = .024); education (p =.007); farm experience (p = .000); farm\
    \ size(p = ..032), household size(p =.000) and membership of social organization\
    \ as well as various sources of available information. The study concludes that\
    \ farmers were favourably disposed to the adoption of various soil conservation\
    \ techniques which emphasize the need to upgrade their knowledge and information\
    \ on environment-friendly soil management practices through the extension services."
