  title: SOIL OF IRRIGATED LANDS OF BUKHARA REGION
  abstract: <em>The article presents data on irrigated soils of the </em><em>J</em><em>ondor
    district of the Bukhara region, intended for cotton sowing.</em><em>Since many
    soils of the territory of Uzbekistan, including the Bukhara oasis, are highly
    saline, research work was carried out on the territory. Along with the other twelve
    regions, the irrigated soils of the Bukhara region are moderately saline, although
    there are some farms in which the lands are characterized by a high degree of
    salinity. Among the areas and cities with a high level of salinity, as an example,
    we can take the soils of the Karakul and Olot regions of the Bukhara oasis. Due
    to the fact that these areas are located in the desert zone of the region, salinity
    levels are high due to low rainfall. Indicators were studied </em><em>the content
    of biogenic elements and the mineral composition of the studied soil samples,
    the total salt content in the soil samples. The content of soluble ions, the content
    and study of the main elements providing soil fertility such as humus, phosphorus,
    nitrogen, potassium and their mobile forms, as well as the concentration of soluble
    salts in the form of anions, cations and macro-elements showed that the studied
    soils belong to the depleted type of sulfate-chloride salinization.</em>
