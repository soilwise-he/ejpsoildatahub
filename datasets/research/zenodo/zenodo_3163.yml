  title: Removal of nitrate and pesticides from groundwater by nano zero-valent iron
    injection pulses under biostimulation and bioaugmentation scenarios in continuous-flow
    packed soil columns
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study evaluates the NO3&minus; removal from groundwater
    through Heterotrophic Denitrification (HDN) (promoted by the addition of acetate
    and/or an inoculum rich in denitrifiers) and Abiotic Chemical Nitrate Reduction
    (ACNR) (promoted by pulse injection of zerovalent iron nanoparticles (nZVI)).
    HDN and ACNR were applied, separately or combined, in packed soil column experiments
    to complement the scarce research on pulse-injected nZVI in continuous-flow systems
    mimicking a Well-based Denitrification Barrier. Together with NO3&minus;, the
    removal of two common pesticides (dieldrin and lindane) was evaluated. Results
    showed that total NO3&minus; removal (&gt;97%) could be achieved by either bioestimulation
    with acetate (converting NO3&minus; to N2(g) via HDN) or by injecting nZVI (removing
    NO3&minus; via ACNR). In the presence of nZVI, NO3&minus; was partially converted
    to N2(g) and to a lower extent NO2&minus;, with unreacted NO3&minus; being likely
    adsorbed onto Fe-(oxy)hydroxides. Combination of both HDN and ACNR resulted in
    even a higher NO3&minus; removal (&gt;99%). Interestingly, nZVI did not seem to
    pose any toxic effect on denitrifiers. These results showed that both processes
    can be alterned or combined to take advantage of the benefits of each individual
    process while overcoming their disadvantages if applied alone. With regard to
    the target pesticides, the removal was high for dieldrin (&gt;93%) and moderate
    for lindane (38%), and it was not due to biodegradation but to adsorption onto
    soil. When nZVI was applied, the removal increased (generally &gt;91%) due to
    chemical degradation by nZVI and/or adsorption onto formed Fe-(oxy)hydroxides.&lt;/p&gt;'
