  title: Various Ecological Factors Influence Of The Natural Environment On The Structure
    Of The Absheron Soil Cover
  abstract: 'The object and purpose of the study is the Absheron peninsula and the
    study of its soil cover structure to provide the object of research in that structural
    form, where its external forms reflect internal qualities.


    The relationship between form and content in soil science can be established on
    the basis of the method of relief plasty. Using this method, the structure of
    the Absheron soil cover was studied and several types were identified. Their soil
    composition, physicochemical and biological properties were determined, which
    together determines their ecological parameters and gives a complete ecological
    assessment of the territory.


    In the course of the work, the biological activity of the Absheron soil differences
    and microbiological activity were assessed. To assess ecobiological selected soil
    samples studied are active in a number of oxidoreductase and hydrolytic enzymes.


    Identified areas that are most promising for agriculture.'
