  title: Evaluation On Bearing Capacity Of Ring Foundations On Two-Layered Soil
  abstract: "This paper utilizes a finite element analysis to study\nthe bearing capacity\
    \ of ring footings on a two-layered soil. The upper\nlayer, that the footing is\
    \ placed on it, is soft clay and the underneath\nlayer is a cohesionless sand.\
    \ For modeling soils, Mohr\u2013Coulomb\nplastic yield criterion is employed.\
    \ The effects of two factors, the\nclay layer thickness and the ratio of internal\
    \ radius of the ring footing\nto external radius of the ring, have been analyzed.\
    \ It is found that the\nbearing capacity decreases as the value of ri / ro increases.\n\
    Although, as the clay layer thickness increases the bearing capacity\nwas alleviated\
    \ gradually."
