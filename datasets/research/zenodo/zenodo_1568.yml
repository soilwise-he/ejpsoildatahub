  title: Illegal Dumping of Oil and Gas Wastewaters Alters Semi-Arid Soil Microbial
    Communities
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The Permian Basin, underlying New Mexico and Texas, is one of\
    \ the most productive oil and gas (OG) provinces in the United States. Oil and\
    \ gas production yields large volumes of wastewater with complex chemistries.\
    \ The environmental health risks posed by these OG wastewaters are not well understood,\
    \ particularly in the case of accidental or intentional releases. Starting in\
    \ November 2017, 39 illegal dumps of OG wastewater were identified in southeastern\
    \ New Mexico that released approximately 6.4x105 liters of fluid onto desert soils.\
    \ To evaluate the impacts of these releases on soils, we analyzed changes in soil\
    \ geochemistry and microbial community composition by comparing soils from within\
    \ OG wastewater dump-affected zones to corresponding unaffected zones with no\
    \ known releases. We observed significant (p&lt;0.01) changes in soil geochemistry\
    \ for all dump-affected samples compared to controls, reflecting the residual\
    \ salts and hydrocarbons left behind by the OG-wastewater release (e.g., enriched\
    \ in sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), and bromide (Br)). Illumina 16S iTag sequencing\
    \ revealed significant (p&lt;0.01) differences in microbial community structure\
    \ between dump and control zones. Furthermore, soils from dump areas had significantly\
    \ (p&lt;0.01) lower alpha diversity and exhibited differences in phylogenetic\
    \ composition. Dump-affected soil samples showed an increase in halophilic and\
    \ halotolerant taxa, such as members of the Marinobacteraceae, Halomonadaceae,\
    \ and Halobacteroidaceae, suggesting that the high salinity of the dumped OG wastewater\
    \ exerted a selective pressure on microbial communities. Taxa related to known\
    \ hydrocarbon-degrading organisms, e.g., &lt;em&gt;Marinobacter,\_Salegentibacter,\
    \ Chromohalobacter&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alcanivorax&lt;/em&gt;, were also\
    \ detected in the dump-affected soil-sample communities. The microbial communities\
    \ in control soils were dominated by taxa ubiquitous in, and well adapted to,\
    \ arid and nutrient-deprived soil environments including photosynthetic Cyanobacteria,\
    \ hydrogen-oxidizing Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, and nitrogen-fixing Alphaproteobacteria.\
    \ This study demonstrated that OG-wastewater dumps can lead to shifts in microbial\
    \ community composition and function towards salt- and hydrocarbon-tolerant taxa\
    \ that are not typically found in desert soils, thus altering the impacted dryland\
    \ soil ecosystem. Loss of key microbial taxa, such as those that increase arid\
    \ soil fertility, or promote plant health, could result in cascading affects to\
    \ myriad ecosystem services such as loss of flora. Further studies are needed\
    \ to explore the potential for using halophilic and hydrocarbon-degrading taxa\
    \ to bioremediate OG-wastewater affected lands.&lt;/p&gt;"
