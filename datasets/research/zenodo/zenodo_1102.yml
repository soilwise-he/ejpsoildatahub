  title: Modelling the seasonal variations of soil temperatures in the Arctic coasts
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The soil temperature within the Arctic coasts within the continuous permafrost
    is not widely measured; the temporal and spatial resolutions of the measured temperature
    observations are relatively high. In this study, we examined the methods to interpolate,
    hindcast and forecast temperature measurements within the active layer and shallow
    permafrost when the temperature measurements at the surface or near the surface
    are available. The temperature variations along the year are periodic, and hence
    attempts are made to express the seasonal variations with a combination of periodic
    function (Fourier components); which are used as boundary conditions to reach
    the analytical solutions. The temperature measurements from surface to about 10
    metre of depths at the Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea are available. We adopted a
    data-driven model based on simplified analytical closed-form solution derived
    from the boundary conditions. The parameters of the solution are calibrated from
    the field measurements and validated with field observations. The model then can
    be used to hindcast and forecast temperature at any points within the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
