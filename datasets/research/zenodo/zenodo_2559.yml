  title: Assessment of Physicochemical and Selected Heavy Metal of Soil around Dana
    Steel Industry Limited Katsina, Katsina State, Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The physicochemical parameters and levels of selected heavy\
    \ metals (Cd, Cr, Mn, Zn and Pb) in soil around Dana Steel Rolling Limted Katsina\
    \ were investigated in this research. The sample area was divided into four units;\
    \ East, West, North and South and label as A, B, C and D respectively using stratified\
    \ random sampling method.\_ The soil was digested using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,\
    \ HClO&lt;sub&gt;4 &lt;/sub&gt;and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for 15 minutes\
    \ and filtered. The filtrate was used for the analysis using Atomic Absorption\
    \ Spectrophotometer. The results obtained showed that the sampling area is mildly\
    \ alkaline with \_\_\_\_pH &gt;7.0. Low moisture and organic matter was also observed\
    \ in the entire sampling site. For the heavy metals contents, the results indicated\
    \ that the area under investigation was not polluted with respect to heavy metals\
    \ content. As the metals content investigated were all below the US EPA standard\
    \ of heavy metals in soils that requires clean up.&lt;/p&gt;"
