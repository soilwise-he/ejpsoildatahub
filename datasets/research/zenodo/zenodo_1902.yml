  title: Effect of Irrigation Water Quality on Soil Structure Along Asa River Bank,
    Ilorin Kwara State
  abstract: "Good soil structure is an essential element of healthy and sustainable\
    \ agroecosystems. It promotes the development of extensive plant root systems\
    \ and efficient use of water and nutrients. An experiment was carried out with\
    \ the objective of evaluating the effect of irrigation water quality on soil structure,\
    \ it was conducted in a two way factorial with four (4) locations selected along\
    \ the river (0m, 200m, 400m and 600m) as factor A, and four (4) farmers\u2019\
    \ plots were selected based on the years of irrigation (0, 10, 20 and 30 years)\
    \ as factor B while three (3) farmers plots with similar irrigation history were\
    \ used as replicates, with this arrangement 12 plots were selected in each farming\
    \ location giving a total of 48 plots from which soil samples were taken for analysis.\
    \ The mean concentration of the parameters were pH (7.09-7.82), Electrical Conductivity\
    \ {EC} (0.09-0.14), Sodium Adsorption Ration {SAR} (0.12-0.74) Exchangeable Sodium\
    \ Percentage {ESP} (3.59-9.46), Sand (74.67- 82.10), Silt (11.28-16.67), Clay\
    \ (6.89-11.06), Mean Weight Diameter (1.38-1.53), Bulk density (1.12-1.29), Porosity\
    \ (51.26-54.08), Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (1.18-3.57). The mean concentration\
    \ showed increase as the water flow downstream while higher value observed at\
    \ location 3 (400m), the collected soil samples were subjected to analysis of\
    \ variance using randomized complete block design (RCBD) at 5% probability level.\
    \ The result showed that all the parameters were in a safe range when compared\
    \ with WHO (2005) and FAO (2007) standard. It was recommended that effluent discharge\
    \ and dumping of refuse along the river channel should be forcefully discouraged\
    \ and that government should help in providing household disposal sites for the\
    \ inhabitants of the town and that regular monitoring of Asa river be carried\
    \ out as there is notable increase in the level of human and industrial activities\
    \ along the course of the river."
