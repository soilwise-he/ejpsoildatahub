  title: pH Titration Curves of Some Uttar Pradesh Soil Clays in Aqueous Hydrochloric
    Acid Medium
  abstract: 'Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad <em>Manuscript
    received 3 February 1972; revised 15 November 1975; accepted 29 January 1976</em>
    The buffering capacity of fourteen (14) soil clays obtained from twelve different
    soils of U.P. (India) has been determined in simple hydrochloric acid medium.
    The maximum buffering capacity shown by the different soil clay-hydrochloric-acid
    systems has been found to lie in the following order : Varanasi old alluvium clay
    &gt; Acid clay &gt; Kanpur old alluvium clay &gt; Kabar clay &gt; Kanpur recent
    Alluvium clay &gt; Rakar clay &gt; Parwa clay &gt; Alkali clay &gt; Varanasi recent
    alluvium clay &gt; Mar clay &gt; Vindhyan clay &gt; Tarai clay &gt; Hill clay
    &gt; Bhabar clay. The buffering property of clay minerals constituting the different
    soil clays is assigned primarily to the OH-groups present in the alumina octahedra
    and silica-tetrahedra sheets of the clay minerals. pH of the soil clays appear
    to influence this buffering property in the sense that soil clays of higher \(p\)H
    consume less of alkali (except Tarai clay which consumes comparatively more alkali
    though it is having high pH value).'
