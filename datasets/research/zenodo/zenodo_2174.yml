  title: Liming leads to high bean and maize yield on a strongly acid tea soil | IJAAR
    2021
  abstract: Acid soils are very common in tea zones. These soils have a pH below 5.0.
    Below this pH, not only do the soils exhibit toxicity of aluminum and manganese
    but are deficient of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and molybdenum, hence becoming
    chemically infertile. Liming is one cheap way of reclaiming these soils. The staple
    food crops in these tea soils are maize and beans. However the effect of different
    liming levels on bean (<em>Phaseolus vulgaris </em>L.<em>) </em>and maize (<em>Zea
    maiys, </em>L.) yield on acid tea-growing <em>ando-humic Nitisol</em> had not
    before been investigated. A study was therefore conducted to determine the crop
    response to liming and the appropriate liming level for maize and bean crops in
    a tea zone soils. The experiment was carried out in Embu County, Kavutiri and
    Kianjokoma areas, Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) UM1. A randomized complete block
    design with four replications of each lime treatment was used at each site. Lime
    at rates of 0 (L0), 2.4 (L1), 6 (L2), 8 (L3) t/ha was broadcasted on to 4m x 4m
    plots and mixed into 0-15cm of soil. There was a significant response to liming
    for both maize and beans. The maximum maize and beans yield was attained at around
    liming level L2 (pH 5.5). Above this pH, yields started to decline. The study
    clearly shows the benefits of soil liming on strongly acid tea soils and also
    the importance of accurate lime applications. Published by the<strong> International
