  title: Progress of Soil Acidity Management Research in Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This review paper tries to put together soil acidity management
    research based evidences generated recently. In the context of agricultural problem
    soils, acid soils are soils in which acidity dominates the problems related to
    agricultural land use. Soil acidity problems are increasing in the highland areas
    of Ethiopia. Application of lime coupled with fertilizer improves the productivity
    of crops in acid affected soils. In Nedjo condition, lime level 5 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;with
    69&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;phosphorus gave best yield
    (1346.2&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and (1635.5 kgha&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    of finger millet and teff respectively. Similarly, yield of faba bean was obtained
    by applications of 16 .5 (t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 13(t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    of lime along with 30 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;P fertilizer at Bedi
    and Emdibir respectively.&nbsp; Application of 16.5 t ha&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-1&nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;lime
    with 30 P (kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) gave 212% yield increment over the
    control that has no lime but 30 P (kg ha&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).&nbsp;
    Integrated reclamation approach centring lime-fertilizer and soil nutrients interaction
    is vital to establish cost effective and sustainable nutrient management of this
    soil.&nbsp; 50% FYM + 50% NP + 50% lime treatment gave significant yield and yield
    component of teff at Nedjo testing site, this result showed that proper knowledge
    and enhanced use of integrated soil fertility management technologies such as
    combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers in the presence of a soil- conditioner&nbsp;
    lime are vital in improving and sustaining crop production. From an experiment
    conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of limes produced at different locations
    in Ethiopia no statistical yield difference was observed, and this implies that
    both lime produced at Senkele (Oromia region) and Dejen (Amhara region) can successfully
    answer their regional lime needs. When Senkele lime, Dejen lime and Ca(OH)2 from
    Ghion gas factory were compared with Awash calcite and Awash dolomite, these two
    Awash products were greatly preferred. The reason might be mainly from the material
    they are processed and as well the technology under which they were crushed.&lt;/p&gt;'
