  title: Soil invertebrates occurrences in European North-East of Russia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The European North-East of Russia is the territory which includes
    the Nenets Autonomous District, represented by the East European tundra (from
    Kanin Peninsula to Vaigach Island), Komi Republic with its taiga ecosystems, and
    the Urals (Northern, SubPolar and Polar). Over 20 years of systematic studies
    of soil fauna in the studied region, a huge amount of data has accumulated that
    can be analyzed from different positions. Considering that the representation
    of Russian soil biota data, especially from European North-East of Russia in the
    GBIF database is not big, our data are of great interest to the scientific world
    community. The accumulation of such data will solve questions on national, global
    scales using large arrays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study produced a dataset containing
    information on occurrences on soil invertebrates (Lumbricidae, Chilopoda, Diplopda,
    Collembola, Elateridae, Staphylinidae) in the European North-East of Russia. The
    dataset summarizes occurrences noted in natural and disturbed forests, tundra
    and mountain ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 196 geo-referenced localities
    of European North-East of Russia (tundra, taiga and mountains ecosystems) are
    made. A total of 5412 occurrences are included in the resource. The current project
    surveys 13 species of earthworms, 20 species of millipedes, 246 species of springtails,
    446 species of rove beetles, 60 species of click beetles. The diversity of soil
    invertebrates in the European North-East of Russia has not been fully explored
    and further exploration will lead to more taxa.&lt;/p&gt;'
