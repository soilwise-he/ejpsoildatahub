  title: THE EFFECT OF VERMICOMPOST APPLIED ON LEAVES AND SOIL ON DIFFERENT DATES
    ON THE VEGETATIVE PROPERTIES OF PEA (PISUM SATIVUM L.)
  abstract: The experiment was conducted from February to July 2021 in the Dicle University,
    Agriculture Faculty, Field Crops Department Experiment Farm. Vermicompost fertilizer
    was applied on the 21st and 42nd days (26 March and 16 April) after the emergence
    of 2000-2500 ml/ha on the soil, and 500 ml/ha on the leaves at the flowering stage.
    The experiment was laid out in Randomized Block Design with three replications.
    Plants were harvested at six times 10-day intervals after 45 days emergence. Observations
    on the number of nodes, stipules, leaves, tendrils and pods per plant, pod fresh
    and dry weight, and pod length were taken. The number of nodes, stipules, leaves
    and tendrils per plant was not affected by vermicompost application. Vermicompost
    applications at 21 and 42 days on the soil were more efficient than the control
    and on the leaf application.
