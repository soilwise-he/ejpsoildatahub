  title: Microbiological and physiochemical analyses of oil contaminated soil from
    major auto mechanic workshops in Ado-Ekiti metropolis
  abstract: The ability of microorganisms to utilize used oil in contaminated soil
    from some selected major mechanic workshops in Ado Ekiti metropolis as a sole
    source of carbon and energy was studied. Soil samples collected from the two major
    mechanic workshops at Adebayo, and Irona Quarters in Ado-Ekiti were analyzed for
    the microbiological and physicochemical qualities using the basic microbiological
    methods. The physicochemical properties of the soil samples shows that the value
    of pH range from 5.45 to pH 5.58, percentage of carbon range from 3.98 % to 4.20%,
    nitrogen content varies from 2.20 to 2.40. The total heterotrophic bacterial counts
    from the mechanic workshops ranges from 7.52 x 106 to 8.25 x 106cfu/g while the
    total heterotrophic fungal counts ranges from 5.54 x 106 to 6.25 x 106 cfu/g.
    The bacterial recovered from the oil contaminated soils include <em>Staphylococcus</em>
    spp., <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Bacillus</em> spp., <em>E. coli</em>
    and <em>Acinobacter</em> spp. The frequency of occurrence of the microbial isolates
    revealed that <em>Bacillus cereus</em> 5 (31.25%) occurred most, followed by <em>Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa</em> (18.75%), <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. (18.75%) and <em>E. coli</em>
    (18.75%) while <em>Citrobacter freundii</em> (12.50%) had the lowest frequency
    of occurrence. The results of this study have showed that some of the isolated
    organism can be used for bioremediation of the contaminated soil.
