  title: Effects of nitrite concentrations on soil and certain vegetables irrigated
    with wastewater of Kubanni stream in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study examined the effect of nitrite ions in wastewater,
    soil and vegetables through man-made activities. Nitrite level was determined
    in wastewater, soil and vegetables&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;viz.,&lt;/em&gt;spinach (&lt;em&gt;Amaranthus
    hybridus&lt;/em&gt;), lettuce (&lt;em&gt;Lactuca sativa&lt;/em&gt;), cabbage (&lt;em&gt;Brassica
    oleracea&lt;/em&gt;), carrot (&lt;em&gt;Daucus carota),&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;okra (&lt;em&gt;Hibiscus
    esculentus&lt;/em&gt;), onion (&lt;em&gt;Allium cepa&lt;/em&gt;) and tomato (&lt;em&gt;Lycopersicon
    esculenetum&lt;/em&gt;) collected on seasonal basis along Kubanni stream in Zaria.
    The levels of nitrate in the wastewater, soils and vegetables were determined
    using UV/Visible and Smart Spectrophotometer. Results obtained show that nitrite
    concentrations ranged from 12.05 &ndash; 53.21 mg/L in the year 2013 and 1.58
    &ndash; 17.09 mg/L in the year 2014 for wastewater, soil had concentrations ranged
    from 0.05 &ndash; 6.40 mg/kg in the year 2013 and 0.90 &ndash; 9.90 mg/kg for
    year 2014 while the vegetable had levels of 3.80 &ndash; 23.65 mg/kg in the year
    2013 and 7.48 &ndash; 27.15 mg/kg in the year 2014. Statistical tests indicated
    no significant difference in nitrite levels across the locations and seasons for
    wastewater, soil and vegetables evaluated. Correlation results for these two years
    indicated low (r = 0.399, r = 0.275) relationship for wastewater and vegetables
    whereas negative (r = -0.290) relationship noticed for the soil. The results showed
    that irrigating the farmland with untreated wastewater has negative consequence
    on the crops grown with it and thus, cultivation of wastewater irrigated soils
    and vegetables should be continuously monitored to stop any possible hazard.&lt;/p&gt;'
