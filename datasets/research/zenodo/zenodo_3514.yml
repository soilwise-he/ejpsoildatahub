  title: Leachate Generation From Landfill Lysimeter Using Different Types Of Soil
    Cover
  abstract: 'The objectives of this study are to determine the

    effects of soil cover type on characteristics of leachates generated

    from landfill lysimeters. Four lysimeters with diameter and height

    of 0.15 and 3.00 m, respectively, were prepared. Three lysimeters

    were filled with municipal waste and three different cover soil types

    i.e. sandy loam soil, silty loam soil and clay soil while another

    lysimeter was filled solely with municipal waste. The study was

    conducted in the rainy season. Leachate quantities were measured

    every day and leachate characteristics were determined once a week.

    The cumulative leachate quantity from the lysimeter filled solely

    with municipal waste was found to be around 27% higher than the

    lysimeters using cover soils. There were no any differences of the

    cumulative leachate amounts generated from the lysimeters using

    three types of soils. The comparison of the total mass of pollutants

    generated from all lysimeters showed that the lysimeter filled solely

    with municipal waste generated the maximum quantities of

    pollutants. Among the lysimeters using different types of soils, the

    lysimeter using sandy loam soil generated the lowest amount of most

    of pollutants, compared with the lysimeters using silty loam and clay

    soils. It can be concluded that in term of pollutant attenuation in the

    leachate, a sandy loam is the most suitable soil to be used as a cover

    soil in the landfill.'
