  title: PRODUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LACCASE FROM ASPERGILLUS TERREUS ISOLATED
    FROM SAW MILL SOIL OF OSMANABAD
  abstract: "The novel fungal laccase was produced from <em>Aspergillus terreus</em><strong>\
    \ </strong>\u2013S19 isolated from saw mill soil of Osmanabad. The enzyme laccase\
    \ was produced in solid state fermentation by incubating fungal strain up to 96h\
    \ incubation, and partially purified by the sequential method of Ammonium sulphate\
    \ precipitation followed by nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL)<strong> </strong>cut-off\
    \ ultra filtration using 30K filters. The partially purified enzyme showed 91.08\
    \ U/L of enzyme activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme was confirmed about\
    \ 56.0 kilodalton (kDa) by the SDS-PAGE analysis. The partially purified enzyme\
    \ showed excellent activity at pH 5.0 and temperature 30<sup>0</sup>C. The enzyme\
    \ activity enhanced in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, surfactants\
    \ and organic acids, whereas; the L-cysteine completely inhibit the enzymatic\
    \ activity. In conclusion, the novel laccase enzyme obtained from <em>Aspergillus\
    \ terreus</em><strong> </strong>\u2013S19 explored the promising candidature for\
    \ the several potential applications in the decolourization of dyes, degradation\
    \ of lignin, pigment xenobiotics, pulp and paper industries, food industries,\
    \ wine clarification, and several other industrial processes."
