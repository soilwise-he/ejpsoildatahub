  title: Evaluating validation strategies on the performance of soil property prediction
    from regional to continental spectral data
  abstract: "Visible-near infrared (vis\u2013NIR) spectroscopy has been widely used\
    \ to characterize soil information from field to global scales. Before applying\
    \ a calibrated spectral predictive model to acquire soil information, either independent\
    \ validation or <em>k</em>-fold cross validation is used to evaluate model performance.\
    \ However, there is no consensus on which validation strategy is more suitable\
    \ and robust when evaluating model performance for the studies in different scales.\
    \ The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the model performance\
    \ of two validation strategies coupling different calibration sizes (a ratio of\
    \ calibration to validation of 2:1, 4:1 and 9:1) and calibration sampling strategies\
    \ (random sampling (RS), rank, Kennard-Stone (KS), rank-Kennard-Stone (RKS) and\
    \ conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS)) across scales. A total of 17,272\
    \ vis\u2013NIR spectra of mineral soils from LUCAS data (continental scale) and\
    \ their soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay contents were used in this study, and\
    \ the dataset was further split into national (2761 samples in France) and five\
    \ regional datasets (110 to 248 samples from five French administrative regions).\
    \ To eliminate the effect of changing validation set on the model performance,\
    \ a consistent test set (20% of total samples at each scale) was split to evaluate\
    \ all the combinations involved in two validation strategies. The Lin\u2019s concordance\
    \ correlation coefficient (CCC) of the cubist model were stable for both SOC and\
    \ clay for different calibration sizes, calibration sampling and validation strategies\
    \ for a large calibration size (&gt;1400) at the national and continental scales.\
    \ A larger calibration size can potentially improve model performance for a small\
    \ dataset (&lt;300) at the regional scale, and a wider calibration range would\
    \ result in better model performance. No silver bullet was found among the different\
    \ calibration sampling strategies at the regional scale. For five French regions\
    \ (small data set), we found a high variation (95th percentile minus the 5th percentile)\
    \ in the CCC among the models built from 50 repeated RS (0.10\u20130.44 for SOC,\
    \ 0.16\u20130.52 for clay) and cLHS (0.08\u20130.40 for SOC, 0.12\u20130.36 for\
    \ clay). This finding indicates that a one-time RS or cLHS for selecting the calibration\
    \ set has high uncertainty in model evaluation for a small dataset and therefore\
    \ should be used with caution. Therefore, we suggest the following: (1) for a\
    \ large data set (thousands), either one-time random sampling for independent\
    \ validation or <em>k</em>-fold cross validation would be appropriate; (2) for\
    \ a small data set (dozens to hundreds), <em>k</em>-fold cross validation and/or\
    \ repeated random sampling for independent validation would be more robust for\
    \ spectral predictive model evaluation."
