  title: ISOLATION OF KERATINOLYTIC FUNGI FROM SOIL SAMPLES OVERCAST BY PRESENCE OF
    CHICKEN
  abstract: Keratinophilic fungi are an important group of fungi that occurred in
    soil. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify keratinolytic fungi from
    the 10 soil samples overcast by presence of chicken from Slovakia. Isolation of
    the fungi was performed by hair bait technique. The isolated colonies were identified
    by morphologic feature of macro- and microconidia. The isolated keratinolylic
    fungi<br> were classified into 10 species belonging to 6 genera. From the total
    of 123 isolates of keratinolytic fungi represents Chrysosporium keratinophilum
    39 (31.7%), Trichophyton ajelloi (30.1%), Myceliophthora vellerea (10.6%), Trichophyton
    terrestre and Chrysosporium evolceanui (6.5%), Chrysosporium fluviale (5.7%),
    Microsporum gypseum (4.1%), Arthroderma uncinatum (2.4%), Purpureocillium lilacinum
    (1.6%), Chrysosporium indicum (0.8%). Most of the fungi (96 isolates) were isolated
    from the soils with the pH range of 7 to 8.
