  title: Influences of Soybean N Fixation on Soil N Balance in Rice-Soybean Rotation
  abstract: This article 'Influences of Soybean N Fixation on Soil N Balance in Rice-Soybean
    Rotation' appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series, created by
    the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication among
    scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice and
    rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each other
    informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific notes are meant
    to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to obtain details
    on the research reported.
