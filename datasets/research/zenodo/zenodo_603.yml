  title: Ex-Situ Remediation of a Petroleum Hydrocarbons Contaminated Soil
  abstract: The remediation of polluted soils is a key concern of modern society due
    to importance of this natural resource for present and its conservation for future.
    Intensive anthropic activities facilitate sometimes the discharge of wastes or
    hazardous pollutants (like petroleum hydrocarbons) that lead to the soil contamination.
    The aim of this research is to summarize the experimental data resulted in the
    assessment of the quality indicators for a hydrocarbon contaminated soil (at depth
    of 5 cm and 30 cm) as well as results from an ex-situ remediation technology at
    laboratory scale performed using extraction with organic solvents (carbon tetrachloride,
    glacial acetic acid and hexane) and repeated water washes. The wastewaters containing
    traces of pollutant were collected and also treated by adsorption (with pine sawdust
    as adsorbent) followed by sedimentation.<br> The proposed ex-situ remediation
    was found efficient (&gt;79% petroleum hydrocarbons removal) if the amount of
    excavated contaminated soil is limited and the proposed working conditions could
    be applied.
