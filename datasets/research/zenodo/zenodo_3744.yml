  title: The Water Quantity And Quality For Conjunctive Use In Saline Soil Problem
    Area
  abstract: 'The aim of research project is to evaluate quantity and

    quality for conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water in lower

    in the Lower Nam Kam area, Thailand, even though there have been

    hints of saline soil and water. The mathematical model named

    WUSMO and MIKE Basin were applied for the calculation of crop

    water utilization. Results of the study showed that, in irrigation

    command area, water consumption rely on various sources; rain water

    21.56%, irrigation water 78.29%, groundwater and some small surface

    storage 0.15%. Meanwhile, for non-irrigation command area, water

    consumption depends on the Nam Kam and Nambang stream 42%,

    rain water 36.75% and groundwater and some small surface storage

    19.18%. Samples of surface water and groundwater were collected for

    2 seasons. The criterion was determined for the assessment of suitable

    water for irrigation. It was found that this area has very limited sources

    of suitable water for irrigation.'
