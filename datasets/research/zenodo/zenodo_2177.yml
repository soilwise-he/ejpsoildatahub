  title: Revealing the active microbiome connected with the rhizosphere soil of maize
    plants in Ventersdorp, South Africa
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;We conducted shotgun metagenomics sequencing of the maize rhizosphere
    and bulk soils in Ventersdorp, South Africa. Information on the structural composition
    and functional capabilities of microbial communities in the maize rhizosphere
    are provided by the data. Characterising the functional potentials of rhizosphere
    microbiomes gives an opportunity to link the microbiome to plant growth and health
    and provides the possibility of discovering new plant-beneficial genes that could
    enhance agricultural sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;'
