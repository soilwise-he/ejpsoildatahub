  title: SOIL FAUNA FOOD WEB IN SEVERAL LAND USE TYPES OF SUPER WET TROPICAL RAIN
    FOREST AREA
  abstract: Changes land use in the super-wet tropical rainforest area has resulted
    in changes pattern of soil fauna food webs that show the diversity of ecosystems.
    Various soil biodiversity studies tend to prioritize the diversity of soil fauna,
    without examining how changes in the pattern of food flow are running. The results
    showed that the abundance of the highest number of functional individuals of soil
    fauna in each type of land was predator. The diversity of functional types of
    soil fauna in forest and mixed gardens is also dominated by predators and on open
    area types and monoculture gardens dominated by herbivorees. While the parasitoid
    and detritivore groups were spread evenly on each type of land. This shows that
    the pattern of food webs in each land type of super wet tropical rainforest area
    reaches a balance in the type of forest and mixed gardens and begins to be disrupted
    in open area and monoculture gardens. The highest trophic level of food webs is
    the main controller of ecosystem balance. Changes in vegetation type of land in
    super wet tropical rain forest area will cause fragmentation of functional habitat
    of soil fauna which causes imbalance of energy flow in food webs.
