  title: Accumulation of heavy metals in soil and litter of roadside plantations in
    Western Polissia of Ukraine
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The article presents the results of a study on the influence
    of roadside forest belts of different species composition on the accumulation
    of heavy metals in soil and litter along roads of international and national importance
    in the conditions of Western Polissia of Ukraine. Mobile forms of Cd, Cu, Pb and
    Zn in soil and forest litter samples were determined in ammonium acetate extract
    buffer by atomic absorption spectrometry. The analysis of the content of heavy
    metals, their comparison with the maximum allowable concentrations depending on
    the composition of plantations and the category of the highway have been done.
    It is confirmed that roadside forest belts perform important functions in the
    accumulation of heavy metals in soil and forest litter. It is confirmed that roadside
    forest belts perform important functions in the accumulation of heavy metals in
    soil and forest litter. Among all the pollutants studied, the concentration of
    cadmium was the lowest and that of zinc the highest (especially in forest litter).
    Lead and copper in this indicator occupied an intermediate position. Despite the
    different species composition of plantations, the coefficient of concentration
    of heavy metals in the soil did not exceed the maximum allowable concentrations
    and was on average in the range of 0.10&ndash;0.20 of these indicators. The greatest
    effect of delaying the migration of heavy metals was observed in forest litter.
    Therefore, in order to effectively use the biological barrier along the roads,
    it is necessary to create linear protective belts of deciduous species with &lt;em&gt;Acer
    platanoides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Betula pendula&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Carpinus
    betulus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tilia cordata&lt;/em&gt;, which give a rich annual
    litterfall.&lt;/p&gt;'
