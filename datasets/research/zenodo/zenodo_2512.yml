  title: Effect of Several Liquid Bioameliorant Concentrations to Increase the Growth
    and Yield of Glutinous Corn in Sandy Soil
  abstract: "Sandy soil has low organic matter content, low adsorption capacity, low\
    \ cation exchange capacity, high permeability, and a high sensitivity to erosion.\
    \ Such situations often cause crop failure, and efforts to improve growth, crop\
    \ yields, and soil productivity become a major problem. However, how much influence\
    \ the addition of liquid bioameliorant in sandy soil on the growth and yield of\
    \ glutinous corn plants has not yet been revealed. The research aimed to study\
    \ the effect of several liquid bioameliorant concentration on increase growth\
    \ and yield of glutinous corn in sandy soil. The experiment was carried out in\
    \ Telaga Wareng Hamlet, West Winner Village, West Winner District, North Lombok\
    \ Regency, from May to August 2023. The experiment was conducted using a randomized\
    \ block design with five bioameliorant concentrations, namely 100, 200, 300, 400,\
    \ and 500 ml l-1 . The best liquid bioameliorant concentration for glutinous corn\
    \ production is 500 ml l-1 \_, which can increase plant height, number of leaves,\
    \ the concentration of available P and total soil N, uptake of N and P by plants,\
    \ number of spores, colonization of roots, as well as the weight of wet and dry\
    \ plant stems in sandy soil. Liquid bioameliorant concentrations of 500 ml l-1\
    \ produce the highest root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and yield.\nKeywords:-\
    \ Liquid Bioameliorant, Soil Fertility, Plant Growth and Yield."
