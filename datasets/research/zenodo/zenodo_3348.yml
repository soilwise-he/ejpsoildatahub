  title: Application Of Organic Matter On Entisol-Soil Affected Soil Moisture Capacity
    And Growth Of Maize (Zea Mays L.)
  abstract: The research aimed to know growth of maize and soil moisture retention
    of the Luro-Entisol by application of organic matter. Field research was carried
    out in the Odofuro / Luro Timor Leste, analysis of soil samples was done in the
    Soil Physics Laboratory, Soil Science Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University
    of Brawijaya, and Malang. Field experiment used the split plot design, consisting
    of two factors and four replications, resulting in 24 units of experiments. The
    first factor is organic matter (P) consisting of cow manure (P1) and sheep manure
    (P2), and the second factor is dosage of manure, including without fertilizer
    (D0), manure 5 tons ha-1 (D1) and manure of 10 tons ha-1.  Results showed that
    dosage of manure has significantly effects on plant height, stem diameter, fresh
    weight and dry weight of stalk, but not significant effected the soil particle
    density, soil bulk density, total soil porosity and soil moisture.
