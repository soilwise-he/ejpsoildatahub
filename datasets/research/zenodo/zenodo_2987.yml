  title: High resolution mapping shows differences in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks
    in areas of varying landscape history in Canadian lowland tundra
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract: &quot;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) in Arctic coastal polygonal tundra is vulnerable
    to climate change, especially in soils with occurrence of large amounts of ground
    ice. Pan-arctic studies of mapping SOC exist, yet they fail to describe the high
    spatial variability of SOC storage in permafrost landscapes. An important factor
    is the landscape history which determines landform development and consequently
    the spatial variability of SOC. Our aim was to map SOC stocks, and which environmental
    variables that determine SOC, in two adjacent coastal areas along Canadian Beaufort
    Sea coast with different glacial history. We used the machine learning technique
    random forest and environmental variables to map the spatial distribution of SOC
    stocks down to 1&nbsp;m depth at a spatial resolution of 2&nbsp;m for depth increments
    of 0&ndash;5, 5&ndash;15, 15&ndash;30, 30&ndash;60 and 60&ndash;100&nbsp;cm.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The results show that the two study areas had large differences in SOC
    stocks in the depth 60&ndash;100&nbsp;cm due to high amounts of ground ice in
    one of the study areas. There are also differences in variable importance of the
    explanatory variables between the two areas. The area low in ground ice content
    had with 66.6&nbsp;kg C/m&lt;sup&gt;&minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; more stored SOC than
    the area rich in ground ice content with 40.0&nbsp;kg C/m&lt;sup&gt;&minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
    However, this SOC stock could be potentially more vulnerable to climate change
    if ground ice melts and the ground subsides. The average N stock of the area low
    in ground ice is 3.77&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;&minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; and of the
    area rich in ground ice is 3.83&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;&minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;These findings support that there is a strong correlation between ground
    ice and SOC, with less SOC in ice-rich layers on a small scale. In addition to
    small scale studies of SOC mapping, detailed maps of ground ice content and distribution
    are needed for a validation of large-scale quantifications of SOC stocks and transferability
    of models.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;'
