  title: Removal of Pesticides and Reclamation of Soil through Biochar Application
    as a Soil Amendment
  abstract: The extensive use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers has promoted
    soil contamination and also contaminated groundwater through the percolation of
    water and imparting lethal severe health effects on living beings and the environment.
    In modern agriculture, pesticides are inevitable as they are required to control
    pests, weeds, and other pests, which undoubtedly result in the gradual degradation
    of soil quality. Therefore to deal with environmental as well as possible health
    effects, the contaminated soil has to be remediated by using environmental-friendly
    soil amendments. In this context, biochar could be a promising agent because biochar
    has high porosity, maintain soil alkalinity, have abundant functional group, and
    has an exceedingly aromatic structure, which makes biochar an efficient adsorbent;
    hence these properties of biochar make it a suitable agent to reduce pesticides
    in the soil and also prevent percolation of pesticides to the water. The mutual
    effects of soil organisms and biochar on pesticide reduction have received recent
    attention. In this review, we have highlighted the use of biochar as a soil amendment
    in the context of the removal and degradation of pesticides in the soil, along
    with the probable mechanism of biochar action on soil remediation.
