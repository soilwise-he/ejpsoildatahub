  title: Effect Of The Intrecation Betwwen Saline Irrigation Water And Drip Irrigation
    System (Sub-Surface) On Chemical And Physical Properties Of The Soil In Abu Gharib
    District
  abstract: "A field study was conducted in Soil Research Department (Ministry of\
    \ Agriculture), located in Abu Ghraib district to study the effect of irrigation\
    \ water salinity and drip irrigation system on soil properties according to using\
    \ of drip irrigation system (under the surface) and through specific scenarios\
    \ included the quality of water used (S): 1. Tap water (): (0.6 - 0.7 ds/m), 2.\
    \ Medium-salinity water (): (2.6 \u2013 3.0 ds/m), 3. High-salinity water ():\
    \ (4.9 \u2013 5.1 ds/m), and 4. The alternating irrigation method : through using\
    \ one irrigate of tap water followed by one irrigate of highly saline water. The\
    \ results showed the increase of the chemical properties and the decrease of the\
    \ physical properties of the soil when the irrigation by water salinity (), also,\
    \ the decrease of the chemical properties and increase of the physical properties\
    \ of the soil when the irrigation by water salinity (, addition to, the increase\
    \ of the chemical properties in the depths (0-10, and 30-45cm) when using drip\
    \ irrigation system (sub-surface) more than the depths (10-20, and 20-30 cm) with\
    \ the decrease of the physical properties in the depth (0-15) when using drip\
    \ irrigation system (sub-surface) more than the depth (15-30 cm)."
