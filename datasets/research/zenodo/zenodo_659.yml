  title: Prediction of Soil Compaction Parameters using Gene Expression Programming
  abstract: The determination of soil compaction parameters, maximum dry density (MDD)
    and optimum<br> moisture content (OMC), in the laboratory requires considerable
    time and energy. Various efforts<br> have been made to counter the issue by developing
    models to predict compaction parameters of<br> soil, but they are either applicable
    to specific soil types or specific compaction energies. A machine<br> learning
    technique, Gene Expression Programming (GEP), is used in this study to predict
    the<br> compaction parameters of soil using the index properties of soils collected
    from literature. In terms<br> of accuracy, the GEP models presented in this study
    outperformed the previously developed<br> prediction models. The accuracy (R-squared)
    for training and validation of MDD was found to be<br> 0.8945 and 0.9032, respectively,
    and that for training and validation of OMC was 0.9165 and<br> 0.9251, respectively.
