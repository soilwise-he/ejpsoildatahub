  title: Effect of dumpsite organic manure soil on growth, nutrient content, and yield
    of Curcuma longa L.(turmeric) in Owerri, Imo State
  abstract: "<em>Curcuma longa L.</em>(turmeric) is one of the most essential available\
    \ spices in Nigeria. The field study was conducted at Teaching and Research Farm\
    \ of Faculty of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Imo State University, Owerri,\
    \ Nigeria. During the planting season of 2019 to assess effect of different levels\
    \ of Dumpsite Organic Manure Soil on Growth parameters, nutrient content and yield\
    \ of turmeric. The experiment was laid in Randomized Block Complete Design with\
    \ three replications. T\xAD<sub>1</sub>: Control, T<sub>2</sub>: 05 tons; T<sub>3</sub>\
    \ 10 tons, T<sub>4</sub>: 15 tons of Dumpsite Organic Manure Soil. The result\
    \ of the study revealed that high doses (T\xAD<sub>4\xAD</sub>) of Dumpsite soil\
    \ significantly influenced maximum growth parameters viz; plant height, leaf area,\
    \ leaf length, leaf area index.15 tons of Dumpsite Organic Manure Soil (T<sub>4</sub>)\
    \ recorded the maximum yield per hectare (17.66kg/h) while the lowest (6.863kg)\
    \ was obtained from control. The result of proximate composition showed that 15\
    \ tons (T<sub>4</sub>) of dumpsite organic manure soil significantly improve the\
    \ Ash, Fibre, Protein and carbohydrate contents compare to control. Moisture content\
    \ (81%) and fat content (0.6369%) were higher in control compare to other treatment\
    \ levels. The result has shown that Dumpsite Organic Manure Soil has potential\
    \ to improve growth of Turmeric (<em>Curcuma longa</em> L.) and other crops."
