  title: SOIL MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR THE CONTROL OF JUVENILE POPULATIONS OF SPITTLEBUGS
    IN OLIVE GROVES
  abstract: "In the olive groves, the main factor regulating spittlebugs population\
    \ level is the abundances of vegetables ground cover and its species composition.<br>\n\
    Control of the juvenile\u2019s vector population by soil tilling to reduce the\
    \ emergence of adults represents one of the most efficient and environmentally\
    \ sustainable approach toward the control of the spread of <em>Xylella </em><em>fastidiosa</em><em>\
    \ </em>in the infected area, or to reduce the risk of its establishment in the\
    \ buffer zones or free areas. In order to identify alternative strategies for\
    \ soil management in olive groves, for two consecutive years (2017 \u2013 2018)\
    \ we compared five different soil management techniques: (i) natural and undisturbed\
    \ ground vegetation; (ii) soil tilling performed twice (in early winter and in\
    \ spring when the majority of the nymphs were at the IV instar); (iii) soil tilling\
    \ performed only in winter; (iv) sowing <em>Lolium </em>spp; (v) sowing <em>Hordeum\
    \ vulgare</em>.<br>\nTwo surveys per year were carried out. In each thesis, of\
    \ approx. 3,000m2, 30 subplots of 0.25 m2 randomly distributed were surveyed by\
    \ counting the number of spittle/plants and number of specimens (<em>P. </em><em>spumarius</em>\
    \ and <em>N. </em><em>campestris</em>)/spittle. Soil tilling performed in winter\
    \ and spring, effectively reduced almost to zero the presence of both spittlebug\
    \ species, with an Abbott\u2019s index equal to 99.6%. Conversely, when soil tilling\
    \ was performed only in winter, it proved to be effective for reducing <em>N.\
    \ </em><em>campestris</em><em> </em>population (Abbott\u2019s index ranged from\
    \ 50% to 60%) but not for <em>P. </em><em>spumarius</em>. Sowing in winter Lolium\
    \ spp. and Hordeum vulgare reduced <em>P. </em><em>spumarius</em> juvenile populations,\
    \ with an Abbott\u2019s index of 60% and 40%, respectively. Whereas, results were\
    \ inconsistent for <em>N. </em><em>campestris</em>: in 2017 on both Poaceae treatment,\
    \ the juvenile populations were lower than on the undisturbed natural ground cover,\
    \ with an Abbott index equal to 58% (<em>Lolium</em>) and 86% (<em>Hordeum vulgare</em>),\
    \ while the population resulting mostly abundant during survey carried out in\
    \ 2018. These data further support the effectiveness of mechanical interventions\
    \ for reducing incidence of juvenile of spittlebugs, and that using poaceae species\
    \ to replace the ground vegetation may contribute to lowering<em> P. </em><em>spumarius</em>\
    \ populations."
