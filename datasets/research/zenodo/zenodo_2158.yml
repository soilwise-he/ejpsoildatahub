  title: Influence of Humic and Fulvic acids on the Availpbility and Inorganic Transformation
    of Phosphorus in soil
  abstract: "Faculty of Agriculture. University of Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal. <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 6 February 1974 ; accepted 1 July 1974.</em> The effects of humic and\
    \ fulvic acids on the availability of phosphates and inorganic transfor\xADmation\
    \ of added water soluble phosphate in four soils of varied characteristics were\
    \ studied. Available phosphours contents of the soils were determined by chemical\
    \ methods. Humic and fulvic acids greatly increased the availability of phosphorus\
    \ both in phosphate treated and untreated soils. Application of these acids solubilised\
    \ the native phosphates of iron, aluminium and calcium and minimised the transformation\
    \ of added water soluble phosphate into iron phosphate, aluminium phosphate and\
    \ calcium phosphate. The effect of fulvic acid in these respects was more pronounced\
    \ than that of humic acid."
