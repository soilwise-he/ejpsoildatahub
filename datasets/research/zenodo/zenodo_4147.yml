  title: Evaluation Of Phyto-Extraction Potentials And Performance Of False Sesame
    (Ceratotheca Sesamoides) Under Induced Soil Pollution By Automobile Lubricant
    In Savanna Ecoregion
  abstract: While strategizing towards achieving improved soil fertility for sustainable
    tropical crop production, timely application of fertilizers on regular basis alone
    is not the University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Nigeria best approach,
    particularly on polluted soils. However, seeking for reliable natural, biological
    and environment friendly means of ensuring effective riddance of toxic elements
    or heavy metals from tropical agricultural soils is equally a worthwhile technology.
    An open-field potted experiment was conducted during early raining season of 2016
    (March-July), at the Teaching and Research Farms of Oyo State College of Agriculture
    and Technology, Igboora, to investigate the effect of spent engine oil polluted
    soil conditions on performance and heavy metal accumulation potentials of Ceratotheca
    sesamoides. Spent engine oil was applied at different concentrations (0.0ml, 50.0ml,
    100.0ml, 150.0ml, and 200.0ml to each pot containing 7kg soil. Four pots per treatments
    were used. The trial was arranged in Completely Randomised Design (CRD), replicated
    three (3) times. Data were collected on growth parameters (number of leaves, plant
    height, stem girth, leaf length and leaf breadth). The data were subjected to
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was used to
    the means. Pre and post-cropping soil analyses were carried out, for determination
    of nutrient concentrations. Also, after the termination of the experiment, plant
    samples were collected from each of the pots for oven-drying followed by determination
    of nutrient concentrations (including the heavy metals). Oil pollution significantly
    affected growth and heavy metal accumulation of the test-crop. Growth decreases
    with increasing rate of lubricant application, while the heavy metal concentrations
    in the test-crop increased with increasing concentrations of the applied spent
    engine oil. Thus, Ceratotheca sesamoides is a wild plant which could be easily
    exploited for its heavy metals hyper-accumulative or phyto-extractive potentials,
    so as to reclaim heavy metals polluted soils from toxicity, for sustainable crop
    production.
