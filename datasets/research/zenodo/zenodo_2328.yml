  title: Rate of changes of potassium and cationic micronutrients in submerged soil
    affected by potassium and zinc interactions
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp; Soil Science, Institute of\
    \ Agricultural Science, University of Calcutta,<br> 51/2, Hazra Road, Kolkata-700\
    \ 019, India<br> <em>E-mail</em> : priyamaroy@gmail.com<br> College of Agriculture,\

    \ Government of West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript received 08 April 2015, revised\
    \ 24 June 2015</em>, accepted 01 July 2015 The interaction study between potassium\
    \ and zinc was conducted with an inceptisol under submerged soil condition at\
    \ ambient laboratory conditions with their nine different treatment combinations.\
    \ It was found that exchangeable K increased gradually till 42 days of incubation\
    \ before decreasing and was maintained highest (189.20 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup>)\
    \ in the treatment T<sub>6</sub> where both K and Zn were applied combinedly at\
    \ 60 and 5 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> respectively. But regarding changes with respect\
    \ to the cationic micronutrients it was observed that the amount of Fe, Mn, Cu\
    \ and Zn was highest with the values 152.94, 64.94, 2.64 and 10.18 mg kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup> respectively in the treatment T9 where K and Zn were applied combinedly\
    \ at their highest level (K @ 60 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> soil and Zn @ 10 mg kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup> soil) at 42 days of incubation for Fe and Mn, 35 days of incubation for\
    \ Cu and 14 days of incubation for Zn. From the present investigation it is concluded\
    \ that both Zn and K has a positive synergistic effect on one another under submerged\
    \ soil conditions."
