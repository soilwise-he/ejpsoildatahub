  title: Variation in the rates of biomass removal by soil macro-fauna in different
    land uses at Rashad, South Kordofan, Sudan
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;One of the main implications of reducing biodiversity is the
    loss or decline of ecosystem function. We have previously seen in the Rashad location
    that agricultural practices have a lower effect on ant biodiversity. However,
    how they affect the environmental services, they provide is unclear. The main
    objective of this study was to evaluate whether the conversion of native areas
    into agricultural systems affects the removal of biomass carried out by ants,
    an important ecosystem function linked to decomposition and predation. We sampled
    three transects from (the Rashad district). Each sampling plot consisted of a
    grid of 12 pitfall traps filled with sardine baits (simulating animal organisms)
    and bananas (as attractive vegetable resources). In addition, grass seeds (&lt;i&gt;Sorghum
    bicolor&lt;/i&gt;) were applied in both natural (Campo, Kubos, and forest) and
    agricultural settings (soy monoculture, pastures, and organic agriculture). The
    Results showed that ant&rsquo;s removal was highest in sardine with an average
    of 87.3g (&sigma; &plusmn; 23.8), followed by banana (average of 70.5g, &sigma;
    &plusmn; 31.5) and lowest in the seed (mean of 7.8g, &sigma; &plusmn; 7.3) (highest
    p = 0.017). Only the soy monoculture regions showed the lowest levels of sardine
    removed, indicating an effect associated with the kind of land use. Because little
    biomass is eliminated in both natural and agricultural settings, no effect of
    the seeds bait has been observed. As for the banana bait, the data suggested a
    redundancy effect with another group of macro-fauna). Our results suggest that
    there is a redundancy effect with another group of macrofauna. However, macrofauna
    biomass (excluding ants) does not explain this biomass removal. In addition, it
    detected no impact of ant species composition on removed biomass. The reduction
    of sardine and banana biomass was correlated with ant richness, indicating that
    the effects on ecosystem function depend on the particularities of each evaluated
    role (such as resource type), the type of land use, and the ant richness in the
    study area.&lt;/p&gt;'
