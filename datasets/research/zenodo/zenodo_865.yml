  title: Centrifuge Model Tests for Investigation of Fiber Reinforced Soil Walls
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The centrifuge model tests were used to evaluate the geotechnical
    properties of fiber reinforced soil walls. The reducedscale centrifuge models
    were built and the clay barrier was prepared using kaoline amended silty soil.
    The unreinforced soil barrier was found to lose their water-tightness and integrity
    at lower distortion levels compared to fiber reinforced soil barrier. The silty
    soil used in the centrifuge models, frequently considered as having negligible
    creep, did not ultimately found to prevent the development of time-dependent deformations.
    Thus, the significant time-dependent deformations could be occurred in geotechnical
    structure of fiber reinforced soil walls wall systems. The long-term behavior
    of reinforced soil walls structures was investigated under stress levels using
    centrifuge model.&lt;/p&gt;'
