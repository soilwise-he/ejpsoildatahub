  title: EFFECT OF MAGNETIC IRRIGATION WATER AND SOIL CONDITIONERS ON SANDY SOIL PROPERTIES
    UNDER SALINE STRESS CONDITIONS
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> Salinity is one of the most important threats
    to agriculture especially in Sinai. So, this study was carried in North Sinai
    for one season to evaluate the effects of Magnetite Iron soil conditioners with
    and without magnetic water irrigation on Date Palm tree under salt stress conditions.
    There is not much research carried out the combination effects of magnetic water
    and Magnetite Iron as a soil amendment to improve soil properties and crop yield
    under saline conditions at North Sinai, Egypt. The treatment of Magnetite or Magnetic
    Iron was 0, 300, 550 and 800 gm/tree with and without magnetic water irrigation.
    From the results, the best treatment was 800gm/tree magnetite iron with magnetic
    water which decrease EC, SAR and pH by 14 %, 5% and 2% consequently. On the other
    hand, it was improved soil properties such as OM and CEC as follow 29 % and 31%
    consequently. The macronutrient (N, P, and K) was increased by 40%, 14% and 7%
    consequently when compared with nonmagnetic water. Also, there was increased soil
    content of micronutrients (Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cu) as follow 20%, 12.5%, 22% and 17%
    consequently when compared with nonmagnetic water. In addition, it is consequently
    enhanced yield components compared with nonmagnetic water irrigation which increased
    by 60%.
