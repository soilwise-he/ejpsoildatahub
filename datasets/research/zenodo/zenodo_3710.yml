  title: Nutritional And Phytochemical Studies Of Jatropha Tanjorensis Ellis &amp;
    Saroja Under Varied Soil Conditions.
  abstract: 'Introduction: This present study was carried out to assess the mineral
    nutrient and phytochemical properties in leaves of the test plant and the influence
    of soil properties on them. Methods: Leaves of J. tanyorensis obtained from two
    sampling locations (Akwa Ibom State-L1 and Bayelsa State-L2), were analysed for
    phytochemical and mineral nutrient contents using standard procedures. The physico-chemical
    properties of soils in the sampling locations were also assessed. Results: There
    were variations in soil physico-chemical properties between the two sampling locations.
    There were marked variations (P&lt;0.05) in elemental nutrient and phytochemical
    compositions in leaves of J. tanyorensis between the two sampling locations. Conclusion:
    This study suggests that the soil conditions in L1 sampling location enhanced
    the phytochemical and mineral nutrient contents in leaves of J. tanyorensis than
    that of L2 location. Therefore, appropriate soil improvement practices are required
    in L2 sampling location in order to improve the biochemical properties of this
    important species.'
