  title: Isolation, characterization and identification of roundup degrading bacteria
    from the soil and gut of Macrotermes michaelseni
  abstract: Roundup degrading bacteria were isolated from the soil and gut of fungus
    cultivating termites <em>Macrotermes michaelseni</em> using MM7 media supplemented
    with the pesticide as the sole source of carbon and energy<em>.</em> The isolates
    were gram negative rods the isolate from the soil was designated GS1 while that
    from termite gut was designated GT2. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolates
    revealed that isolates Both isolates GS1 and GT2 are closely related to E<em>nterobacter
    sp</em> AY 0822447 with 99% sequence similarity. The results of this study highlight
    the potential of these bacterial isolates to be used in bioremediation. Published
