  title: Contribution of Soil and Water Conservation Techniques to Soil Carbon Sequestration
    in a Forest Ecosystem in West Africa (Burkina Faso)
  abstract: "Kuinima forest ecosystem, a classified forest, located in western Burkina\
    \ Faso, is undergoing accelerated degradation due to climatic hazards and anthropogenic\
    \ factors such as excessive cutting of trees, bush fires, etc. The main objective\
    \ of this study is to assess the contribution of three water and soil conservation\
    \ techniques (Za\xEF forest, stone rows, Za\xEF forest+ stone rows) to soil carbon\
    \ sequestration and their impact on some soil physicochemical parameters. Thus,\
    \ soil samples were taken, and the physicochemical parameters of the soil were\
    \ analyzed in the laboratory. The organic carbon stock was calculated based on\
    \ the results of the carbon content analysis. The results revealed that the treatments\
    \ had higher clay and silt contents than the control. The treatments also had\
    \ a significant impact on soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen, available\
    \ potassium and cation exchange capacity over the 0-20 cm depth. Compared to the\
    \ control, the Za\xEF forest, Za\xEF forest+stone rows and stone rows treatments\
    \ led to respective increase in the carbon stock of 166%, 77% and 21%. In conclusion,\
    \ this study has shown that Za\xEF forest and stone rows can contribute significantly\
    \ to soil carbon sequestration to fight against climate change.Read Complete Article\
