  title: "Spatial Identification And Classification Of Soil Erosion Prone Zones Using\
    \ Remote Sensing &amp; Gis Integrated \u2018Rusle\u2019 Model And \u2018Sateec\
    \ Gis System\u2019"
  abstract: "Soil erosion by water is pronounced critical problem in Himalayan regions\
    \ due to anthropogenic pressure on its mountainous landscape. Its assessment and\
    \ mapping of erosion prone areas are very essential for soil conservation and\
    \ watershed management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial\
    \ distribution of average annual soil erosion in Ton Watershed (a sub-basin of\
    \ Asan watershed) using Remote Sensing and GIS integrated \u2018RUSLE\u2019 Model\
    \ and GIS based Hydrological Model of \u2018SATEEEC GIS system\u2019 in Dehradun\
    \ district of Uttarakhand state. Remote sensing and GIS technologies were used\
    \ to prepare required input layers in the form of Rain Erosivity factor (R), soil\
    \ erodability factor( K), Length and steepness of Slope factors (LS), crop management\
    \ factors ( C) and support practice factor ( P) to utilize in RUSLE and SATEEC\
    \ GIS Models. One of the advantages of using SATEEC GIS system is no additional\
    \ input data, other than those for RUSLE are required to operate the system. Vulnerability\
    \ to soil erosion risk in the watershed revealed that 24.16 percent of area from\
    \ RUSLE model, and 20.21 percent of area from SATEEC GIS system was in high soil\
    \ erosion risk zone. Very low risk of erosion was observed at 68.18 percent and\
    \ 57.12 percent of areas from SATEEC GIS system and RUSLE model respectively."
