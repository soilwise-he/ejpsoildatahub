  title: "EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN A DEEP SOIL MIXING SOLUTION\
    \ \u2013 A CASE STUDY FROM A HIGH-RISE PROJECT FOUNDATION IN SINGAPORE"
  abstract: "Construction projects directly impact economies' social, economic and\
    \ environmental progress. The carbon footprint of construction projects could\
    \ be reduced in their various phases \u2013 conceptual, design and construction.\
    \ This paper talks about ways to reduce the carbon footprint of projects during\
    \ the construction phase using the case study of the development of an 11-storey\
    \ high-rise building with two basements. The earth retaining and stabilizing structure\
    \ (ERSS) used diaphragm walls as a retention system with a top-down construction\
    \ method to facilitate basement construction. A soil improvement block, using\
    \ two techniques, deep soil mixing (DSM) and Jet Grouting (JG), is constructed\
    \ below the final excavation level to provide lateral support and stiffness to\
    \ the retention system. The original design uses CEM I Ordinary Portland Cement\
    \ (OPC) to produce cement grout in DSM and JG works. To lower the carbon footprint\
    \ of the solution, the project team followed the carbon hierarchy. A low-carbon\
    \ replacement for cement, namely ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS),\
    \ is adopted as an alternative. An alternative cement CEM III/A, with 60-65% of\
    \ OPC replaced with GGBS, is used while complying with the original engineering\
    \ requirement - unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and stiffness modulus (E)\
    \ of the DSM columns. In addition, a larger diameter DSM mixing tool is deployed,\
    \ reducing the resources needed compared with the original smaller diameter. As\
    \ a result, overall project carbon emissions are reduced by 7% compared to budget\
    \ carbon emissions. This paper discusses the details of carbon emissions savings\
    \ and operation aspects that helped achieve carbon reduction."
