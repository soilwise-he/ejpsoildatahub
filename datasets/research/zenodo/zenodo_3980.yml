  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The silt fractions have a great impact in soil structural formation.
    If the soil-forming rocks do not disturb, crush, and weather, the soil-forming
    processes on them occur weakly, the organic substances cause the formation of
    the loamy stratums without completely turning. This mostly influences the initial
    soil-forming layers. The reproduction minerals in these soils cause initial minerals
    majority by occurring weakly. If these processes occur quickly, then they cause
    a gradual increase of the reproduction minerals and reduction of the initial minerals.
    The heights of the zones where the geographical spreading of such stratums is
    situated depend on levels.&lt;/p&gt;'
