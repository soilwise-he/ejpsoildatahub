  title: Nitrogen dynamics and carbon sequestration in soil following application
    of digestates from one- and two-step anaerobic digestion

    time by adding an extra anaerobic digestion step can be utilized to further degrade
    the digestates, contributing to increased&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about nitrogen

    sequestration&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;after field application. This study investigated
    the effects of prolonging retention time by implementing an additional anaerobic
    digestion step on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the soil and soil carbon sequestration.
    Two digestates obtained from two&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about biogas from

    operating at contrasting hydraulic retention times, with and without an additional
    digestion step, were applied to a&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about loamy sand

    sand&lt;/a&gt; soil. N mineralisation dynamics were measured during 80 days and
    C mineralisation during 212 days. After 80 days of incubation, the net inorganic
    N release from digestates obtained from a secondary AD step increased by 9&ndash;17
    % (% of the N input) compared to corresponding digestates obtained from a primary
    AD step. A kinetic four-pool carbon model was used to fit C mineralisation data
    to estimate carbon sequestration in the soil. After 212 days of incubation, the
    net C mineralisation was highest in undigested solid biomass (68 %) and digestates
    obtained from the primary AD step (59&ndash;65 %). The model predicted that 26&ndash;54
    % of C applied is sequestered in the soil in the long-term. The long-term soil
    C retention related to the C present before digestion was similar for one- and
    two-step AD at 12&ndash;16 %. We conclude that optimizing the anaerobic digestion
    configurations by including a secondary AD step could potentially replace more
    mineral N fertiliser due to an improved N fertiliser value of the resultant digestate
    without affecting carbon sequestration negatively.&lt;/p&gt;'
