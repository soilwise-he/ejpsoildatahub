  title: Determination of Soil Organic Carbon, B.E.C. and Certain other Soil Constituents
    by Soil-conductometric Method.
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-211 002.\
    \ <em>Manuscript received 15 May 1976 ; accepted 28 June 1976</em> Fifty Indian\
    \ soils belonging to semi-desert, arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, humid-temperate\
    \ and per-humid soil climatic regions have been taken to determine the specific\
    \ conductance of these soils In aqueous media at 25\xB0. These values were then\
    \ correlated with the values of different soil analyzates. It has been observed\
    \ that out of twenty-one soil properties only 12 soil properties viz. SiO<sub>2</sub>\
    \ (negative), Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, C, C/N,\
    \ pH (negative), B.E.C., Exch., Ca+ Mg (negative), Silt-I-Clay, Silt/Clay, total\
    \ sand (negative) and total sand/silt+clay (negative) were found to be significantly\
    \ correlated at 5% level with the specific conductance values of soils. The regression\
    \ equations especially for those 'r' values (coefficients of correlation) which\
    \ are significant, have only, been proposed. It is suggested that the proposed\
    \ reaction equations may help in the determination of a particular soil analyzate\
    \ provided the corresponding specific conductivity values of soil samples are\
    \ known."
