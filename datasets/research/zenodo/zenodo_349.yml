  title: Can we measure soil density with radiometrics?
  abstract: Current practice in radiometric data analysis seems to have largely ignored
    using the Compton scattered gamma rays to characterise the very near surface,
    the soil horizon. The emphasis is upon the line spectra from radioisotope decay
    and removing or stripping out the scattered radiation from the parent and daughter
    product line source radiation for geochemical analysis. These radiation lines
    in the gamma spectrum are the gamma rays that do not interact with the other elements
    in the soil. Only the scattered radiation provides us with a means to characterise
    physical properties so the soil. Thus, if we want to infer soil density then we
    should analyse the scattered gamma radiation from the Compton spectrum as it is
    done with borehole density tools. With borehole tools a strong and calibrated-known
    gamma source is used to normalise the Compton gamma count. In the case of airborne
    radiometric we have robust procedures to calculate the in-situ source radiations
    strength already in place. Numerical modelling of gamma radiation with GEANT4
    to examine the possibility of measuring soil density via radiometrics on an airborne
    platform indicates it is possible. However, leached soil horizons and very saturated
    mediums may reduce the density estimate accuracy substantially.
