  title: Nutritional Value of Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L. Walp) Grain Grown Under
    Different Soil Moisture as Affected to the Dual Inoculation with Nitrogen Fixing
    Bacteria and Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi
  abstract: The study was performed to evaluate the nutritional value and antioxidant
    properties of cowpea grain, where plants were grown under conditions of tripartite
    symbiosis (cowpea plants, nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Bradyrhizobium japonicum)
    and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, (Glomus intraradices) without fertilization.
    Cowpea plants (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cv. Hrisi were grown in a glasshouse
    until the full maturity of grain on the Alluvial meadow soil (Eutric Fluvisol)
    at three levels of water-holding capacity (40, 60 and 80%). Bradyrhizobium japonicum
    solely and in combination with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased the content
    of proteins, soluble sugars and total phenols in the cowpea seeds. When dual inoculation
    has applied the levels of proteins and soluble sugars in the cowpea grain did
    not reduce at 40%, nor at 80% in comparison with the optimal water-holding capacity
    level (60%). Antioxidant capacity at 40% water-holding capacity was determined
    by the increased content of water soluble antioxidants, flavonoid content and
    increased ferric reducing power activity and increased antioxidant levels was
    expressed more distinguished in the treatments with dual inoculation. Slight change
    of antioxidants in the grain of cowpea was established at an elevated level of
    water supply. Nutritional value of a grain of cowpea after dual inoculation with
    Bradyrhizobium strains and Glomus intraradices was not determined by the water-holding
    capacity levels.
