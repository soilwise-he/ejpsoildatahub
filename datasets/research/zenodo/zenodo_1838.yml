  title: Evaluation Of Swelling Control Parameters For Stabilized Expansive Soil Buffer
    Layers Under Pavement Embankment
  abstract: Flexible Pavements constructed on expansive soils like Black Cotton (B.C.)
    soils, suffer extensive damages due to volume changes and the resulting swelling
    pressures. The magnitude of the swelling pressure depends on various parameters
    but the moisture content variation which occurs during different seasons is the
    major cause of volume changes. To control this moisture variation, present study
    suggests to lay a lime stabilized buffer layer below the road embankment. This
    layer will be underlain by a mechanically stabilized layer with vertical cut-offs
    on either side. For the success of this methodology, it is necessary that, the
    swelling pressures of the stabilized layers of B.C. soil should be first lowered.
    The success of this protective methodology will also be depending upon the of
    moisture content at which these layers are to be compacted and also on the estimation
    of optimum percentage of lime to be used for stabilization. A combination of measures
    can be used to minimize the replacement of BC soil and its resulting impact on
    overlying structures especially pavements. The aim of the present work is to study
    these two parameters. Subsequently these properties will be used in recommending
    a combination of measures to minimize detrimental effects on overlying flexible
    pavements. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the relation between swelling
    pressure and those standard reference moisture contents such as Shrinkage Limit
    (SL) and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) which being the properties of any given
    soil, will not vary with time. In the present study, therefore, SL and OMC are
    considered as the reference moisture contents for the soil and the variation in
    swelling pressures of the soil is studied at SL, OMC-2%, OMC and OMC+2%. The present
    study also, attempts to find out the possibility of using Shrinkage Limit value
    as a parameter in finding the optimum percentage of lime. X-Ray Diffraction tests
    were also carried out to study the effect of mineralogy on the observed swelling
    behaviour of the soils.
