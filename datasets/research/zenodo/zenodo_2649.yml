  title: Progressive collapse and soil stress analyses of Manupali steel truss bridge
    in Lantapan, Bukidnon under hydraulic and traffic threats
  abstract: "Bridges designed to comply with current design codes may not provide\
    \ enough strength to arrest a possible local failure following an abnormal event,\
    \ thus leading to a progressive collapse. One may employ different approaches\
    \ that vary according to linearity and dynamicity to analyze the potential of\
    \ a structure to progressive collapse. Together with a prior risk assessment,\
    \ this study analyzed the susceptibility of the Manupali steel truss bridge to\
    \ progressive collapse using an adapted nonlinear static approach and assessed\
    \ the bridge\u2019s pile foundation capacity concerning changes in the imposed\
    \ stresses caused by the dynamic effects of progressive collapse. Using P-Delta\
    \ analysis in STAAD.Pro CONNECT Edition V22, this study determined that under\
    \ its self-weight, the Manupali steel truss bridge is susceptible to progressive\
    \ collapse, i.e., it is fracture critical. Nonetheless, being such does not mean\
    \ the bridge is inherently unsafe, only that it lacks redundancy in the design.\
    \ Furthermore, this study found that a collapse does not significantly detrimentally\
    \ affect the foundation system except when the dynamic effect is so tremendous.\
    \ With the results, this study recommends that the design of bridges should consider\
    \ abnormal load cases to mitigate progressive collapse."
