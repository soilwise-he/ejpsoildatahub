  title: Simulating the model for consolidation of short bored pile in pure friction
    soil media
  abstract: "In this paper, the analysis of a numerical study for consolidation analysis\
    \ of short bored pile subjected to axial loads is presented. An analysis of short-bored\
    \ pile is performed using finite element analysis software Abaqus CAE with the\
    \ base of procured experimental data in sand media and a comparative analysis\
    \ on Ansys FEA. Three models in combination of pile and footing system were developed\
    \ by the application of incremental axial load for which the displacement upon\
    \ each load was analyzed taking in consideration the stresses and strains. A parametric\
    \ study was conducted to study the effect of load on and it\u2019s observed displacement\
    \ on the pile with or without footing. A close correlation is found between the\
    \ results obtained by the FE models and the Experimental Model solution. The results\
    \ indicates that the load bearing capacity of pile\u2013footing system increases\
    \ drastically when both acts together instead of acting individually."
