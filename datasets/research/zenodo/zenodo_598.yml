  title: Movement and Transformation of Anhydrous Ammonia in Field Soil
  abstract: Anhydrous Ammonia Laboratory, Fertilizer Promotion &amp; Agricultural
    Research Division,<br> Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd., Durgapur (West Bengal)
    Movement of ammonia under the experimental condition was found to be within 3.7
    cm radius from the line of injection and this was associated with rise of \(p\)H
    of the soil. After 22 days of application, this pH however approached its original
    value. Trasformation of applied NH<sub>3</sub> to NO<sub>3</sub> started from
    the periphery of the horizontal cylindrically shaped ammonia retention zone and
    it approached the point of injection. Appreciable nitrification started only after
    7 days of ammonia application. Initial slow nitrification suggests preplanting
    application of anhydrous ammonia in dry field and then incorporation of irrigation
    water within 7 days without appreciable loss of added nitrogen through leaching
    of nitrate.
