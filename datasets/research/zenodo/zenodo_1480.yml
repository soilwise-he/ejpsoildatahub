  title: Effect of Tillage Practice on Soil Moisture Retention under Three Selected
    Cowpea Varieties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim: &lt;/strong&gt;To evaluate the effect of
    tillage practice on soil moisture retention under three cowpea varieties.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatments were laid out
    in a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement and replicated
    three times.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place and Duration of Study: &lt;/strong&gt;The experiment
    was conducted at St. Theresa farm and Nakamane irrigation scheme in Turkana county
    between November 2014 and January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology: &lt;/strong&gt;Treatments comprised three
    tillage practices: conventional tillage (control), conventional tillage + mulch,
    and zero tillage and three cowpea varieties: M66, K80, and Kenkunde. Soil samples
    were collected using an auger (25 mm internal diameter) from near randomly selected
    5 plants at the depth of 15 cm in all treatments at an interval of 7 days. The
    gravimetric moisture was determined using the FAO equation.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;Tillage + mulch and zero tillage
    conserved 37.07% and 31.63% more moisture than conventional tillage at St Theresa
    demo farm, respectively. At Nakamane irrigation scheme, zero tillage retained
    more moisture content of 33.02% followed by conventional tillage + mulch at 32.24%
    as compared to conventional tillage. Significant interaction was realized between
    tillage practice and variety at Nakamane experimental site only. The main effects
    of variety had no effect on moisture retention.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/strong&gt;Tillage practice has significant
    effect of moisture retention in Turkana county. Any cowpea variety established
    has no effect on moisture retention. A broader use of tillage practices and varieties
    is advisable for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;'
