  title: 'Social capital factors affecting uptake of sustainable soil management practices:
    a literature review'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil quality is in decline in many parts of the world, in part
    due to the intensification of agricultural practices. Whilst economic instruments
    and regulations can help incentivise uptake of more sustainable soil management
    practices, they rarely motivate long-term behavior change when used alone. There
    has been increasing attention towards the complex social factors that affect uptake
    of sustainable soil management practices. To understand why some communities try
    these practices whilst others do not, we undertook a narrative review to understand
    how social capital influences adoption in developed nations. We found that the
    four components of social capital &ndash; trust, norms, connectedness and power
    &ndash; can all influence the decision of farmers to change their soil management.
    Specifically, information flows more effectively across trusted, diverse networks
    where social norms exist to encourage innovation. Uptake is more limited in homogenous,
    close-knit farming communities that do not have many links with non-farmers and
    where there is a strong social norm to adhere to the status quo. Power can enhance
    or inhibit uptake depending on its characteristics. Future research, policy and
    practice should consider whether a lack of social capital could hinder uptake
    of new practices and, if so, which aspects of social capital could be developed
    to increase adoption of sustainable soil management practices. Enabling diverse,
    collaborative groups (including farmers, advisers and government officials) to
    work constructively together could help build social capital, where they can co-define,
    -develop and -enact measures to sustainably manage soils.&lt;/p&gt;'
