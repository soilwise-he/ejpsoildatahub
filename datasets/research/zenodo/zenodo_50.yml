  title: 'Soil Health Security in India: Insights from Soil Health Card Data'
  abstract: This study has made an attempt to assess the soil nutritional status of
    various states in India using secondary data collected from the Soil Health Card
    portal. The study finds that due to the unbalanced use of micro and macro fertilizers,
    the health of the soil is continuously deteriorating across the states and ecological
    regions. Farmers are deliberately using chemical fertilizers in the states, where
    insured irrigation is available. This not only deteriorating soil health but also
    increasing input cost and causing long chronical diseases. Lack of awareness also
    a vital reason behind the unbalanced use of fertilizers. The farmer is injecting
    the same amount of fertilizers in the soil as they injected 20 years ago. However,
    soil chemical property has been changed, when land is either converted from irrigated
    to rainfed or rainfed to irrigate. Therefore, this study recommends that there
    is a need of adopting a holistic approach to match the soil fertilizer demand
    with supply.
