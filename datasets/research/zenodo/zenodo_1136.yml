  title: A microscale method for colorimetric determination of urea in soil extracts
  abstract: "The diacetyl monoxime colorimetric method of determining urea in soil\
    \ extracts was modified for microplate format. A 100\u2010\u03BCL aliquot of extract\
    \ was treated with color reagent in a disposable plastic microtiter plate (96\
    \ wells/plate), and color was developed by heating the plate in a low\u2010temperature\
    \ oven at 87\xB0C for 55 min. After cooling for 20 min at ambient temperature,\
    \ absorbance measurements were simultaneously performed on all 96 wells using\
    \ a microplate reader. The microscale method was faster and more convenient than\
    \ the conventional method; moreover, the volume of waste was markedly reduced.\
    \ Studies to compare the two methods showed very little difference in accuracy,\
    \ precision, or sensitivity."
