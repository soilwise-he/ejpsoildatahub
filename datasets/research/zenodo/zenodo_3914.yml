  title: A Study Of Combined Mechanical And Chemical Stabilisation Of Fine Grained
    Dredge Soil Of River Jhelum
  abstract: 'After the recent devastating flood in Kashmir in 2014, dredging of the
    local water bodies, especially Jhelum River has become a priority for the government.
    Local government under the project name of ''Comprehensive Flood Management Programme''
    plans to undertake an increase in discharge of existing flood channels by removal
    of encroachments and acquisition of additional land, dredging and other works
    of the water bodies. The total quantity of soil to be dredged will be 16.15 lac
    cumecs. Dredged soil is a major component that would result from the project which
    requires disposal/utilization. This study analyses the effect of cement and sand
    on the engineering properties of soil. The tests were conducted with variable
    additions of sand (10%, 20% and 30%), whereas cement was added at 12%. Samples
    with following compositions: soil-cement (12%) and soil-sand (30%) were tested
    as well. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the engineering characteristics
    of soil, i.e., compaction, strength, and CBR characteristics. The strength characteristics
    of the soil were determined by unconfined compressive strength test and direct
    shear test. Unconfined compressive strength of the soil was tested immediately
    and for a curing period of seven days. CBR test was performed for unsoaked, soaked
    (worst condition- 4 days) and cured (4 days) samples.'
