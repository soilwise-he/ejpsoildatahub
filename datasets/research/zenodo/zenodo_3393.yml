  title: Modification of Expansive Soil Using Recycled Plastic Bottle Chips
  abstract: Due to rapid growth in population and urbanization, consumption of plastic
    is increasing day by day. Expansive soil a type of problematic soil is risky that
    has high compressibility, low shear strength and high permeability. In this research,
    expansive soil was stabilized using recycled plastic chips. Used plastic bottles
    were collected and altered into plastic chips and then mixed up with expansive
    soil 5%, 10% and 15%. After that laboratory tests such as specific gravity and
    direct shear test were performed. It was seen that specific gravity was increased
    gradually after mixing plastic chips and shear strength was increased effectively
    for 15% plastic chips addition.
