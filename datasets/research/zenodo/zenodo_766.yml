  title: Importance of Micronutrients for Soil, Plant, Animal and Human Health
  abstract: "Our planet\u2019s survival depends on the precious link between soil\
    \ and water. Over 95 percent of our food originates from these two fundamental\
    \ resources. Soil water, vital for nutrient absorption by plants, binds our ecosystems\
    \ together. This symbiotic relationship is the foundation of our agricultural\
    \ systems. However, in the face of climate change and human activity, our soils\
    \ are being degraded, putting excessive pressure on our water resources. Erosion\
    \ disrupts the natural balance, reducing water infiltration and availability for\
    \ all forms of life. Sustainable soil management practices, such as minimum tillage,\
    \ crop rotation, organic matter addition, and cover cropping, improve soil health,\
    \ reduce erosion and pollution, and enhance water infiltration and storage. These\
    \ practices also preserve soil biodiversity, improve fertility, and contribute\
    \ to carbon sequestration, playing a crucial role in the fight against climate\
    \ change.\_"
