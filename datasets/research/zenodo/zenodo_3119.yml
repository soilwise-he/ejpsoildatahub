  title: 'Molecular and morphological systematics of soil-inhabiting Cryptorhynchinae
    of the genus Acallorneuma and the tribe Torneumatini (Coleoptera: Curculionidae),
    with description of two new species.'
  abstract: "Starting from an ecological classification of the morphotypes of apterous\
    \ western Palaearctic Cryptorhynchinae, molecular systematic and morphological\
    \ results for the monophyletic weevil genus Acallorneuma Mainardi, 1906 and the\
    \ tribe Torneumatini Bedel, 1884 are presented. Based on the mitochondrial CO1\
    \ barcoding region, we discuss the limits of comparative morphology in the uniform\
    \ Acallorneuma species. A catalogue and a pictorial key of all 8\u202Fspecies\
    \ of Acallorneuma are provided. In a second step we compare morphology-based systematics\
    \ of the genus Acallorneuma with our molecular reconstruction. Finally, we focus\
    \ on the related blind, equally wingless and uniform, currently 71\u202Fspecies\
    \ of the tribe Torneumatini living deep in the soil. This overview of the present\
    \ state of research shows that molecular intrageneric resolution is highly dependent\
    \ on the number of sampled species, especially in those cases with particularly\
    \ long edges in the dendrogram. But although Torneumatini sampling was not complete\
    \ due to the elusiveness of these subterranean species, some taxonomic changes\
    \ could still be implemented: Torneuma\u202Fs.\u202Fstr. with the type species\
    \ Torneuma caecum Wollaston, 1860 occurs only on the Madeira archipelago. The\
    \ species of the subgenus Paratyphloporus Solari, 1937 stat.\u202Fnov. - only\
    \ from the western Canary Islands(!) - must be transferred into the genus subgenus\
    \ Paratorneuma Roudier, 1956 stat.\u202Fnov. For all other species of the Mediterranean\
    \ area and the eastern Canary Islands, the systematic classification needs to\
    \ be remade (incertae sedis, see also appendix\u202F2). Torneuma deplanatum deplanatum\
    \ (Hampe, 1864) is the type species of the subgenus Typhloporus that includes\
    \ some, but not all Mediterranean species with a constantly deep and wide pectoral\
    \ canal, which - as it now seems likely \u2013 was developed several times. Two\
    \ new species are described: Torneuma (s.\u202Fstr.) isambertoi St\xFCben spec.\u202F\
    nov. from Madeira and Torneuma (s.l.) cadizensis St\xFCben spec.\u202Fnov. from\
    \ the south of Spain. In both cases keys are given to differentiate from the closely\
    \ related species.\n\nKeywords\n\nAcallorneuma, Torneumatini, Torneuma, Bayesian\
