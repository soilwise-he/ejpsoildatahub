  title: A Comparative Study on Soil Stabilization Techniques
  abstract: <em>The purpose of this study was to discuss about different types of
    current soil stabilization strategies and to compare different types of modern
    stabilization techniques and ground improvements. The modification of soils in
    order to improve their physical characteristics is known as soil stabilization.
    A stable soil is one that exhibits a marked and sustained resistance to deformation
    under repeated or continuous load application, whether dry or wet. It is said
    to be stabilized when a less resilient soil is treated to increase its strength
    and resistance to changes in volume and moisture content. Soil stabilization can
    improve the bearing capacity of soils to sustain pavements and foundations by
    increasing the shear strength of the soil and/or controlling the shrink-swell
    characteristics of the soil. To manage engineering characteristics of a soil,
    such as moisture content, soils that provide the structural basis for roadways,
    construction pads, and parking lots are often chemically treated. The fundamental
    target of this paper was to audit the physical and substance properties of soil
    in various sorts of stabilization techniques. Stabilization and its impact on
    soil show the response instrument with added substances, impact on its solidarity,
    improve and keep up with soil dampness content as well as give an idea for development
    frameworks. Soil adjustment can be cultivated by a few strategies. In this paper,
    geotechnical properties of soil, the methods of soil stabilizations, and basically
    comparisons between various sorts of soil adjustments were shown. Each adjustment
    is acceptable and have some great and some awful viewpoints and one adjustment
    has been differentiated from another stabilization. They have been brought up
    from the near investigation of soil adjustments in this study. As for example,
    lime stabilization can be said suitable for clayey soils, preloading is a better
    approach for improving the ground than blasting, both dynamic compaction and vibroflotation
    are well-known ground improvement techniques but dynamic compaction is far more
    suitable than vibroflotation because it is effective for a wide range of soil
    types, whereas vibroflotation is only suitable for granular and non-cohesive soils.</em>
