  title: Influence of Organic and Inorganic Amendments, Modified Urea, and Application
    Methods on Ammonia Volatilization in Saturated Calcareous Soil
  abstract: This article 'Influence of Organic and Inorganic Amendments, Modified
    Urea, and Application Methods on Ammonia Volatilization in Saturated Calcareous
    Soil' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series, created by
    the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective of this
    publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the
    development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems.
    This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the production
    of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce
    nations in the world.
