  title: Soil Organic Carbon Concentrations and Stocks under Maize/Legume Cropping
    System in Alfisols of a Savanna Zone, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Carbon sequestration in soil aggregates and Carbon stock (SOC)
    under Maize-Legume Cropping system in a Northern Guinea Savanna Alfisol, Nigeria
    trial was conducted in 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. The experiment was a randomized
    complete block design (RCBD), replicated three times and treatments used were:
    Sole Maize (M), &lt;em&gt;Desmodium&lt;/em&gt; (D) and Soybeans (S); Maize-soybeans
    intercrop (MS), Maize-&lt;em&gt;Desmodium&lt;/em&gt; intercrop (MD), Maize Strip
    cropped with Soybean (MS 2:4) and Maize Strip cropped with &lt;em&gt;Desmodium&lt;/em&gt;
    (MD 2:4). Data obtained were evaluated for Organic carbon, carbon stock, Bulk
    density and mean weight diameter of aggregates in the soil. Results obtained show
    that Mono-crop (Sole) Maize treatment gave significantly higher BD than other
    treatments at 8WAP and 16WAP, suggesting that soils under sole maize were degraded
    for sustainable crop production. Organic carbon sequestered over 2014 to 2015
    was least under MD and highest under MD2:4 treatments and mean carbon stock sequestered
    in the macro and micro aggregates was highest under MD 2:4 (28.35 t Cha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    and least under MD (8.82 t Cha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Soil organic carbon
    (SOC) sequestered in macro aggregates under MS (1.38 gkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    were significantly higher than the other treatments. Maize/Desmodium 2:4 treatment
    was inferred to have best improved soil conditions (quality/health) for sustainable
    crop production, mitigate climate change and global warming by sequestering carbon
    better than the other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;'
