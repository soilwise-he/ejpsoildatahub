  title: Estimation of Soil Loss Rate Using RUSLE Model Integrated with GIS and Remote
    Sensing Techniques The Case of Wama Watershed, Western Ethiopia
  abstract: "One of Ethiopia's most problematic issues is soil loss due to degradation\
    \ and erosion. Estimating the quantity of soil loss at the watershed level is\
    \ required to solve this problem. However, in many catchments (watersheds) in\
    \ Ethiopia, specific up-to-date information is still lacking. The goal of this\
    \ study was to use model estimates and GIS to investigate the nature, extent,\
    \ and rate of soil loss in the watershed. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation\
    \ (RUSLE) was used in conjunction with satellite remote sensing and geographic\
    \ information systems(GIS) as a useful tool for conservation planning. Mean annual\
    \ precipitation, digital soil map, digital elevation model, LULC map, and slope\
    \ steepness were used to determine the RUSLE parameters. The result showed that\
    \ the potential annual soil loss of the watershed ranges from 0 to 53200.7t/ha/year\
    \ and the mean annual soil loss rate is 357ton/ha/year. The study area was classified\
    \ into five severity classes as, Low (0 \u2013 15 t h<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>),\
    \ Moderate (15.1 \u2013 35 t h<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), High ((35.1 \u2013\
    \ 50 t h<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), Very High (50.1 \u2013 75 t h<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ yr<sup>-1</sup>) and Severe (&gt;75 t h<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover,\
    \ the total annual soil loss in the study area was 13400000 tons from 3344.Km<sup>2</sup>.\
    \ According to the study result, an area that covers 62% (2074.82 sqr. km) of\
    \ the watershed have low soil loss which indicated more than half of the area\
    \ has low soil loss while 38% (1269.58 sqr. km) of the watershed has severe to\
    \ moderate soil loss. As a result, governments, non-governmental organizations,\
    \ and communities in the watershed should concentrate on implementing soil and\
    \ water conservation measures that will assist to alleviate the situation. The\
    \ integration of the RUSLE model and geographic information systems platforms\
    \ are also presented in this study as a strong and relevant strategy for estimating\
    \ and monitoring the geographical rate of soil loss distribution for sustainable\
    \ soil resource management."
