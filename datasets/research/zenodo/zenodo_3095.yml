  title: EFFECT OF ORGANIC MANURES AND INORGANIC FERTILIZER ON SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS
    AND FLUTED PUMPKIN (Telefeira occidentalis) IN THE REMEDIATION OF PETROLEUM POLLUTED
    SOILS
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> The soils were analyzed to access the effect\
    \ of soil microbial biomass on the growth of fluted pumpkin (<em>Telfairia occidentalis</em>)\
    \ in the remediation of crude oil polluted soils of Bayelsa State. Two (2) locations,\
    \ Imiringi in Ogbia Local Government Area with latitudes 4. 8519 N and longitudes\
    \ 6.3745 E and Koloama in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area with latitudes 4.582222\
    \ N and longitudes 6.064722 E, were selected for this research. Soil samples were\
    \ collected at a depth of 0 \u2013 30 cm, bulked for pot experiment in the screen\
    \ house. Five (5) kilograms of soil were weighed into twenty-four (24) plastic\
    \ buckets of seven (7) liters each for Imiringi and Koloama, making a total of\
    \ forty-eight (48) plastic buckets used. The experimental design was a 2 x 8 factorial\
    \ experiment laid out in a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) replicated three times.\
    \ Results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis of variance using the\
    \ Tukey\u2019s Test to separate means of significant difference at 5 % probability\
    \ level. The amendment materials used were organic manures [cow dung (CD) and\
    \ poultry dropping (PD)] inorganic fertilizer (NPK) and their combinations (CD\
    \ + PD, PD + NPK, NPK + CD and CD + PD + NPK). The study revealed the relationship\
    \ between soil microbial biomass and growth of the plant (<em>Telfairia occidentalis</em>)\
    \ in Imiringi and Koloama, on application of the amendments (treatments) with\
    \ the release of the essential element \u2013 Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus\
    \ to the plant, showing that both are significantly different with few variations\
    \ on the plant growth parameters (vine length, girth and number of branches) at\
    \ different times (4 WAP, 8 WAP and 12 WAP), indicating the effectiveness of the\
    \ application of these amendment materials. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Crude Oil,\
