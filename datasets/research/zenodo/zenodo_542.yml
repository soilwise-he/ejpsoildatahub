  title: Soil moisture variations from boreal forests to tundra
  abstract: Soil moisture has a profound influence on life on Earth, and this vital
    water resource varies across space and time. Here, we explored soil moisture variations
    in boreal forest and tundra environments, where comprehensive soil moisture datasets
    are scarce. We installed soil moisture sensors up to 14 cm depth at 503 measurement
    sites within seven study areas across northern Europe. We recorded 6 138 528 measurements
    to capture soil moisture variations of the snowless season from April to September
    2020. We described the spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture, and test how
    these patterns are linked to topography and how these links vary in space and
    time. We found large spatial variation and often less pronounced temporal variation
    in soil moisture across the measurement sites within all study areas. We found
    that throughout the measurement periods both univariate and multivariate models
    with topographic predictors showed great temporal variation in their performance
    and in the relative influence of the predictors within and across the areas. We
    found that the soil moisture-topography relationships are site-specific, as the
    topography-based models often performed poorly when transferred from one area
    to another. There was no general solution that would work well in all the study
    areas when modelling soil moisture variation with topography. This should be carefully
    considered before applying topographic proxies for soil moisture. Overall, these
    data and results highlight the strong spatio-temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture
    conditions in boreal forest and tundra environments.
