  title: lmmobilisation and Release of Sulphur in Soil following Addition of Organic
    Materials of Varying Decomposability and Composition
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani-741 235<br> <em>Manuscript received 25 March\
    \ 1982, revised 21 July 1984, accepted 8 June 1985</em> Laboratory incubation\
    \ studies were conducted on immobilisation and release of sulphur from native\
    \ soil organic matter and added organic matter of different compo\xADsition and\
    \ decomposability. Mineralisation of sulphur from native soil organic matter was\
    \ found to depend on its organic sulphur content and not so much on C : S ratio\
    \ or available sulphate sulphur content of the soil. However, sulphur mineralising\
    \ capacity of added organic matter depends on the concentration of sulphur in\
    \ the added organic matter and upon the initial sulphate sulphur content of the\
    \ soil. The results show the value of organic matter addition as well as its nature\
    \ and source of available sulphate sulphur in soil."
