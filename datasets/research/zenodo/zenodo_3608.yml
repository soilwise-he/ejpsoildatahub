  title: Effects Of An Added Foaming Agent On Hydro-Mechanical Properties Of Soil
  abstract: Earth pressure balance (EPB) tunnel boring machines are designed for digging
    in different types of soil, especially clay soils. This operation requires the
    treatment of soil by lubricants to facilitate the procedure of excavation. A possible
    use of this soil is limited by the effect of treatment on the hydro-mechanical
    properties of the soil. This work aims to study the effect of a foaming agent
    on the hydro-mechanical properties of clay soil. The injection of the foam agent
    in the soil leads to create a soil matrix in which they are incorporated gas bubbles.
    The state of the foam in the soil is scalable thanks to the degradation of the
    gas bubbles in the soil.
