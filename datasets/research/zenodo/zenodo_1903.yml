  title: Determination Of Pesticide Residues In Soil Samples Collected From Wurno
    Irrigation Farm, Sokoto State, Nigeria
  abstract: "<em>Pesticide residues of most commonly used classes were analysed in\
    \ soil samples collected from Wurno irrigation field. All the 17 soil samples\
    \ analysed were found contaminated with used pesticides (i.e dichlorvos, mevinphos,\
    \ dimethoate, femitrothion, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, methylparathion, profenofos,\
    \ \u03B3HCH, DDT, dieldrin, endrin and drins), and varying degree of contaminants\
    \ and frequency were found in the top soil. The most widely detected pesticide\
    \ residue was DDT found in 16 samples with a mean level of 2.22 measuring a total\
    \ of 24.10% of the detectable residue, the second most detected pesticide residue\
    \ was chlorpyriphos, having a total of 17.04% of the detectable residue. \u03B3\
    HCH was the third most detectable residue in the sample with a total of 14.77%\
    \ of the detectable residue. Analysis also showed that the two fallow soil samples\
    \ have very low levels (&lt; 1%) of the total detectable residues. </em>"
