  title: Growth and yield response of streak virus resistant maize (TZESR-W) to different
    nitrogen rates on a sandy loam soil of semi-arid region of Nigeria
  abstract: "Field experiments were conducted at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University\
    \ Research Farm, Bauchi during the 1992 and 1993 cropping seasons to investigate\
    \ the \u201CGrowth and yield response of streak virus resistant maize (TZESR-W)\
    \ to different N rates on a sandy loam soil of semi-arid region of Nigeria\u201D\
    . Experimental treatments consisted of seven rates of N (0, 50,100, 150, 200,\
    \ 250 and 300 KgN/ha) and optimum levels of P (17.5 Kg/ha) and K (50 Kg/ha) applied\
    \ as base rates. These were tested in a randomized complete block design with\
    \ 3 replications. N was split applied by side dressing in two equal does: half\
    \ at two weeks after sowing and the other half at 5 weeks after sowing. Experimental\
    \ results revealed that the application of N fertilizer up to 100 KgN/ha significantly\
    \ increased the maize plant height, number of cobs, cob length, cob girth, cob\
    \ weight, grain yield, stover yield and percent N in grain and stover over the\
    \ absolute control in both 1992 and 1993 cropping seasons. In other words, the\
    \ application of N fertilizer beyond 100 KgN/ha was not significant when compared\
    \ with the absolute control. On the other hand, shelling percentage, 1000-grain\
    \ weight and N uptake by stover were not significantly affected by N fertilizer\
    \ application. This study therefore suggested that maize (TZESR-W) could be grown\
    \ on a sandy loam soil of semi-arid region of Nigeria with the application of\
    \ 100 KgN/ha, 17.5 KgP/ha and 50 KgK/ha. Application of N fertilizer beyond 100\
    \ KgN/ha on TZESR-W is a waste of resources."
