  title: Prediction Of Soil Exchangeable Sodium Ratio Based On Soil Sodium Adsorption
    Ratio
  abstract: 'Researchers have long had trouble in measurement of

    Exchangeable Sodium Ratio (ESR) at salt-affected soils. this

    parameter are often determined using laborious and time consuming

    laboratory tests, but it may be more appropriate and economical to

    develop a method which uses a more simple soil salinity index. The

    aim of this study was to determine the relationship between

    exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)

    in some salt-affected soils of Khuzestan plain. To this purpose, two

    experimental areas (S1, S2) of Khuzestan province-IRAN were

    selected and four treatments with three replications by series of

    double rings were applied. The treatments were included 25cm,

    50cm, 75cm and 100cm water application. The statistical results of

    the study indicated that in order to predict soil ESR based on soil

    SAR the linear regression model ESR=0.2048+0.0066 SAR

    (R2=0.53) &amp; ESR=0.0564+0.0171 SAR (R2=0.76) can be

    recommended in Pilot S1 and S2 respectively.'
