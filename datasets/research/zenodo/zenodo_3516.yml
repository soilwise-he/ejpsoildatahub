  title: Experimental And Finite Element Analysis For Mechanics Of Soil-Tool Interaction
  abstract: "In this paper a 3-D finite element (FE) investigation of soil-blade interaction\
    \ is described. The effects of blade\u2019s shape and rake angle are examined\
    \ both numerically and experimentally. The soil is considered as an elastic-plastic\
    \ granular material with non-associated Drucker-Prager material model. Contact\
    \ elements with different properties are used to mimic soil-blade sliding and\
    \ soil-soil cutting phenomena. A separation criterion is presented and a procedure\
    \ to evaluate the forces acting on the blade is given and discussed in detail.\
    \ Experimental results were derived from tests using soil bin facility and instruments\
    \ at the University of Saskatchewan. During motion of the blade, load cells collect\
    \ data and send them to a computer. The measured forces using load cells had noisy\
    \ signals which are needed to be filtered. The FE results are compared with experimental\
    \ results for verification. This technique can be used in blade shape optimization\
    \ and design of more complicated blade\u2019s shape."
