  title: Application of Infrared Spectroscopy to Erodibility Studies of the Soil
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, University of Allahabad, Allahabad <em>Manuscript
    received 27 April 1973; accepted 21 June 1973</em> The IR-absorption spectra of
    un-eroded and eroded soils of semi-desert, arid, semi-avid, sub-humid, Vindhyan
    and Bundelkhand soil-climatic regions of Uttar Pradesh, India were taken by KBr-Mull
    technique on Perkin-Elmer infra-red spectrophotometer. This technique has been
    found useful in characterizing eroded and un-eroded soils and also in differentiating
    more erodible soils from erosion resistant ones.
