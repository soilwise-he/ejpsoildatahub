  title: Effect of mining tailing waste on properties of cement stabilized black cotton
    soil
  abstract: "In most cases, not all available materials for road construction do meet\
    \ the nominal requirements, as such; stabilization becomes necessary. This study\
    \ presents the results of a laboratory experiments carried out to assess the effect\
    \ of mining tailing waste (MTW) as an admixture to ordinary Portland cement (OPC)\
    \ stabilized Black Cotton Soil (BCS). The MTW was obtained from a tin mining site\
    \ in Bukuru, Jos South LGA of Plateau State, Nigeria, while the BCS was obtained\
    \ along Kanawa-Jauro-Gotel road, in Yemaltu-Deba, Gombe, Nigeria. The specimens\
    \ were prepared by admixing the four blends of OPC stabilized BCS (using 0, 4,\
    \ 6, and 8% OPC) with stepped percentage of MTW(0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%) by dry weight\
    \ of BCS. Atterberg\u2019s limits, Sieve analysis, Compaction, soaked California\
    \ Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test were carried\
    \ out on the natural and stabilized BCS. The BCS classifies A \u2013 7 \u2013\
    \ 6 (40) and CH (high plasticity clay) according to the American Association of\
    \ State Highway and Transport Officials (AASHTO M 145-2012) and the Unified Soil\
    \ Classification System (ASTM D 2487-2011), respectively. Addition of MTW to OPC\
    \ stabilized BCS affected the compaction characteristics and improved both the\
    \ soaked CBR, and the UCS. The optimum blend was achieved with 20% MTW admixed\
    \ to BCS stabilized with 8% OPC which gave a 4-days soaked CBR value of 35% and\
    \ a 7 days cured UCS value of 1273 kN/m2. This satisfies the sub-base requirements\
    \ of the Nigerian general specifications. Thus, this study recommends the use\
    \ of 20% MTW with 8% OPC for BCS stabilization."
