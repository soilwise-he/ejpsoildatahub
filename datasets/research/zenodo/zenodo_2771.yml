  title: Inorganic P-fractions in a waterlogged soil subjected to wetting and drying
    cycles in presence and absence of rock phosphate

    received online 29 March 2016, accepted 04 April 2016</em> Phosphorus (<strong>P</strong>)
    transformation in waterlogged soil is different from that of non-flooded situation.
    Dryinginduced soil aeration and re-flooding periodically alters redox conditions
    and therefore stimulate redox-sensitive processes influencing <strong>P</strong>
    binding forms. The release of available <strong>P</strong> from indigenous rock
    phosphate under this situation is another area of study in the present investigation.
    Drying stimulated mineralization of organic <strong>P</strong> and increased reductantsoluble
    forms. Drying of soils furthermore reduced its <strong>P</strong> absorption affinity.
    Single drying at early stage and remoistening is enough to release reductant soluble
    <strong>P</strong> into available pool. However, maintenance of two drying phases
    and remoistening to its waterlogged situation is more effective in releasing inorganic
    <strong>P</strong> in soils. Addition of rock phosphate further accentuates the
    release pattern of inorganic <strong>P</strong> in soil particularly where soils
    were subjected to 2nd drying and remoistening phase. Results also pointed out
    that all fractions of inorganic <strong>P</strong> are closely correlated with
    fixation and release phenomena depending upon the drying and rewetting phases.'
