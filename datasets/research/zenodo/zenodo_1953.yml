  title: Influence of Soil Amendments on Heavy Metal Accumulation in Crops on Polluted
    Soils of Bangladesh
  abstract: 'Pot experiments with soils from three contaminated sites and an additional

    field experiment were conducted. The aim of the experiments was to test different

    organic and inorganic soil amendments to heavy metal uptake and to alleviate

    toxicity in different agricultural crops. Elements in the extracts were measured
    by plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Cadmium in the extracts was measured
    by

    atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), with a heated graphite-tube system (HGA).

    The results of the experiment were statistically evaluated by the LSD test. Almost

    all treatments had positive effects on crop productivity or reduced heavy metal

    uptake. Organic manures especially reduced manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), and

    nickel (Ni) uptake. Iron (Fe) oxides contained in red mud, a by-product of the

    aluminum industry, reduced soil to plant transfer of zinc (Zn), Ni, cadmium (Cd),

    and Cr. The results from these experiments show that it is necessary to select
    and

    combine amendments taking into account both site and crop characteristics.'
