  title: Automated irrigation system based on soil moisture using arduino board
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the best system of irrigation is studied by
    reducing the wasted amount of water and electricity. Automatic irrigation is the
    use of a device to operate irrigation structures so the change of flow of water
    from one bay, or set of bays, to another can occur in the absence of the irrigator.
    In this work, automatic control system of solar irrigation implemented practically
    using arduino board. This photovoltaic (PV) system is applied in the garden of
    Engineering Technical College-Mosul (city in Iraq). PV system can be adjusted
    by many regions in Iraq where it planned to connect on small part of land. Irrigation
    process is controlled depending on moisture sensor that connected to sense the
    soil moisture and giving data to arduino read pin. According to the program that
    uploaded to arduino, DC pump can be controlled as ON-state or OFF-state as respect
    to the soil moisture percentage ratio. Finally, the practical results are approximately
    similar to that obtained from proteus arduino simulator.&lt;/p&gt;'
