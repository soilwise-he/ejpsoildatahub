  title: Impacts Of Pesticides And Fertilizers On Soil, Tail Water And Groundwater
    In Three Vegetable Producing Areas In The Cordillera Region, Northern Philippines
  abstract: 'The study focused on the impacts of pesticides and fertilizers on soil
    and water in three vegetable producing areas in the Cordillera region in the northern
    central part of the Philippines. Three major vegetable producing communities were
    selected as study sites with seventy five (75) key informants interviewed. Soil
    and water samples were obtained to determine the extent of soil and water contamination
    with pesticides and fertilizers. There was a high level of awareness on the negative
    impacts of commercial pesticides and fertilizers on soil, water and human health
    but awareness did not influence the way farmers utilize pesticides and dispose
    of empty bottles/containers of pesticides after use. Soil samples from Balili,
    Mankayan, Benguet and Sadsadan, Mt. Province contain variable amounts of pesticide
    residues in the top 15 centimeter soil surface. The residues detected were: chlorpyrifos,
    profenofos, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate. Chlorpyrifos was found
    in one soil sample in Sadsadan above the Limit of Determination. Similarly, chlorpyrifos,
    cypermethrin and fenvalerate were found in two soil samples in Balili higher than
    the limit of determination. No pesticide residue was found in all soil samples
    obtained from the inner 200 centimeter soil depth. Soils in the garden sites of
    Tinoc, Ifugao were still pesticide free. Water samples in all the sites contain
    no pesticide residues but found to contain high levels of coliform bacteria. Pesticide
    contamination of soil and water was not as severe as anticipated but rather it
    is the presence of coliform bacteria severely contaminating water bodies in the
    area. Natural springs unspoiled by human population are still clean and potable.
    Nitrate levels in soil and water is low but showed some signs of building up due
    to the continuous application of fertilizers. Hospital records showed no reported
    cases of pesticide poisoning due to improper handling. However, there were cases
    of intentional ingestion of pesticides for purposes of committing suicides. Respiratory
    diseases top the list of the ten leading causes of morbidity in all three study
    sites. The study site in Tinoc was affected by frequent cases of diarrhea especially
    during the rainy months.'
