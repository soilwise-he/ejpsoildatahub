  title: 'SOIL ORGANIC CARBON MODELLING: A REVIEW'
  abstract: "Organic carbon is one of the major components in the soil matrix. Due\
    \ to ceaseless reactions (physical and chemical and biological), which define\
    \ the soil\u2019s efficiency and characteristics. The use of conventional nonrenewable\
    \ energy sources produces greenhouse gas resulting in global warming. Global warming\
    \ is a major concern for many scientists as this is heading toward climate change\
    \ resulting in dynamic changes in soil organic carbon stock. To control the alarming\
    \ increase of greenhouse gas in our atmosphere we need to understand the dynamics\
    \ and modeling of soil organic carbon. In present days continuous, monotonous\
    \ conventional cropping method is the reason for the loss of soil organic carbon\
    \ from the soil, a prominent reason for soil degradation and desertification.\
    \ Proper knowledge of soil organic carbon dynamics helps us to manage our agronomical\
    \ field and go towards sustainable agriculture"
