  title: The relationship between Bedrock geometry and soil solum at a regional scale
  abstract: One of the main goals of geomorphometry is to derive the geometry attributes
    from a topographic surface that can be used as predictive variables in the soil-landscape
    analysis. In this study, the relationship between geometry attributes of bedrock
    topography and soil solum in a regional scale was investigated. For this study,
    seven geometry attributes (slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile
    curvature, cross-sectional curvature, maximum curvature and minimum curvature)
    of terrain surface (DTM) and bedrock surface (DBM) was calculated. The multivariate
    adaptive regression splines (MARS) was applied for modeling and MannWhitney U
    test for assessing the statistically differences of the geometry attributes across
    the groups of DTM and DBM. The results showed that there are remarkable differences
    between DTM and DBM geometry attributes, especially the slope gradient, profile
    curvature, maximum curvature and minimum curvature. MARS modeling showed that
    there is a remarkable difference between the relationships of DTM and DBM geometry
    attributes and soil solum and the model fitted based on DBM geometry attributes
    performs better in prediction. In our opinion, the idea of using bedrock topography
    for geomorphometric modeling of soil properties still needs further investigation,
    especially in terms of scale issue.
