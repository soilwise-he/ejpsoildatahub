  title: A framework for determining the total salt content of soil profiles using
    time-series Sentinel-2 images and a random forest-temporal convolution network
  abstract: Soil salinization causes a deterioration in soil health and threatens
    crop growth. Rapid identification of salinization in farmlands is of great significance
    to improve soil functions and to maintain sustainable land management. As salt
    moves in soil profiles during plowing and irrigation, the commonly used protocol
    for measuring and monitoring salt content in topsoil does not provide a thorough
    assessment. In order to quantify and comprehensively evaluate the salt content
    in deep soil, this study developed a novel framework for monitoring total salt
    content in the soil profile to a depth of 1 m by combining information from time-series
    satellite images and machine learning. The field experiments were conducted in
    Alar, Southern Xinjiang, with a total of 120 soil samples and 582 measurements
    of EM38-MK2 apparent electrical conductivity in 2019 and 2020 to quantify the
    vertical variation in the salt content. A total of 42 covariates derived from
    time-series Sentinel-2 images, including 20 salinity indices, 10 soil indices,
    and 12 vegetation indices were used for modeling salinity in the soil profile.
    From the total covariates, 22 were selected using the Random Forest. Soil salinity
    which was modeled using a Temporal Convolution Network in 2019 and 2020 and forecast
    for 2021. The model effectively revealed the spatial and temporal variability
    of the salt content in the soil profile with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.71 and 0.65 for
    2019 and 2020, respectively. The proposed new framework provides an effective
    method to estimate the salt content in the soil profile for precision agriculture
    in arid and semi-arid regions.
