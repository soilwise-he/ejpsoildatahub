  title: Assessing The Effects Of Length, Slope And Distance Between Piles On The
    Bearing Capacity Of A Pile Group Under Axial Loading In Granular Soil
  abstract: "Piles are usually made of steel, concrete, reinforced concrete or wood,\
    \ used to enhance the ground\u2019s bearing capacity in order to enable the construction\
    \ of deep foundations, also called pile foundations. However, the exact effect\
    \ of the complex interaction between the piles and the surrounding soil has not\
    \ adequately been investigated yet. Considering the increased application of the\
    \ technique recently, further analysis is essential for achieving the highest\
    \ economic and technical capacity. Using fewer piles or shorter piles and allowing\
    \ greater distances between pile groups, results to reduced construction. However,\
    \ other restrictions such as high groundwater level, bedrock depth and the limited\
    \ size of the foundation are also to be considered. The issue of optimal pile\
    \ layout is further investigated in the current paper employing Plaxis, a finite\
    \ element software, for modeling purposes and considering axial loadings in granular\
    \ soils. Results are shown and further discussed."
