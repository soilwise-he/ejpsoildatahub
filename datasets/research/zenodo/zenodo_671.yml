  title: Effects of Agri-Environment Schemes in Terms of the Results for Soil, Water
    and Soil Organic Matter in Central and Eastern Europe
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Building on the agri-environment framework in Central and Eastern
    Europe, the article emphasizes the role and the use of the agri-environment in
    provision of different ecosystem services. It shows that relevant conservation
    measures with regard to ameliorating soil degradation contribute to the existence
    of sustainable land systems. In our study, we (i) identified what the soil water
    aggregate means, (ii) reviewed how agri-environment schemes (AES) function to
    support soil water requirements, and (iii) how appropriate soils are identified
    with regard to the implementation of soil conservation under the agri-environment.
    Empirical data were surveyed to assess AES as the pivotal subsidy in four countries:
    the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. Quantitative data were assessed
    to contribute to evidence on and the expenditure effect of the measures. This
    review found that AES schemes in arable land systems implement several approaches
    such as cover crops and the reversion of arable land systems to grassland. The
    costs of AE measures reflect the costs of the particular agri-environmental practice
    and its constraints on commercial performance by the farmer. The AES budget analysis
    showed that subsidization moderately increased over the 2000&ndash;2020 time frame.
    However, the magnitude of the AES budget is still largely overshadowed by generic
    subsidies at farm level.&lt;/p&gt;'
