  title: Understanding the significance of fire-intensity concerning soil nutrients
    and soil-microflorae
  abstract: Fire-intensity plays a crucial role in determining the extent of the impact
    on essential soil nutrients and soil<br> microflorae. As the number and intensity
    of forest fire keep increasing across the globe, we need to understand the different<br>
    scientific aspects of a forest fire. Some organisms are benefited while some get
    detrimentally affected after single or repeated<br> burns. Thus, we need to create
    a clear understanding of fire-intensities and associated conditions that might
    impact the<br> proportions of different soil nutrients and soil microflorae.
