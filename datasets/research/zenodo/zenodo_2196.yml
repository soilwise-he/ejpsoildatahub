  title: Assessing the potential risks of industrial soil of highly industrialized
    and less cities on plant growth
  abstract: 'Heavy metals are due to accumulate over time in the soils thereby act
    as a sink reservoir from which toxicants are released to the groundwater and eventually
    for the uptake by plants. This study was aimed at investigating the heavy metal
    concentrations and the consequent effects on two common food crops (maize and
    cowpea). Three sites of ten soil samples at two points (0 and 50 meters apart)
    were collected with two samples from various manufacturing area of: Sango-Otta
    (highly industrialized), Oluyole industrial estate (less industrialized) and Saki
    with no industrial activities. Suitable spot nearest to the production area on
    the site were located and fifty meters away from the first site. The top soil
    layer was scrapped off using a shovel, and a portion of soil was scooped inclining
    the shovel beneath the earth. Soil samples were collected from depths of one feet
    and four feet respectively. The sample were put in a clean plastic container weighing
    about 200 g and was subsequently air dried and transported to the laboratory for
    test. Concentrations of heavy metals were found to be very high in the highly
    industrialized than in the less industrialized cities. Conversely, the F-calculated
    value was 2.906 &gt; 0.096<sup>b</sup> which was significant in soil samples of
    post-planting in cowpea, and the F-calculated value was 1.021 &gt; 0.319<sup>b</sup>
    F-Sig for the soil samples post planting in Zea mays. As reported in this study,
    the concentration of heavy metals impacted on the field performance of the selected
    crops. The concentration of heavy metals in the soil should be continuously monitored
    by farmers before planting especially those in the highly industrialized cities.'
