    <em>Manuscript received online 26 December 2012, revised 31 January 2013, accepted
    28 March 2013</em> The catalytic activity of silver and gold nanoparticles in
    the spectrophotometric determination of parathion using 1-naphthol as a new coupling
    reagent to form an azo dye is described. It is based on the reduction of nitro
    group in parathion with zinc/HCl to form an amino derivative, which is diazotized
    and subsequently coupled with 1-naphthol to form an orange colored azo dye in
    alkaline medium. The size and shape effect of silver and gold nanoparticles in
    the time for diazotization is thus studied. The important analytical parameters
    and optimum reaction conditions have been evaluated.'
