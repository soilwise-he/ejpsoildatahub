  title: 'Laboratory Tests Based Strength Evaluation of Alluvial Soil: A Case Study'
  abstract: "<em>This article represents an analysis of alluvial soil behaviour using\
    \ laboratory tests where samples being collected from different parts of Khulna,\
    \ Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a riverine country and 80% of soil in Bangladesh is\
    \ alluvial. Especially, the Khulna region stands on the Gangetic alluvial soil\
    \ track that poses a challenge to the foundation engineers. Determination of shear\
    \ strength parameters comprising of cohesion (c) and internal friction angle (\u03A6\
    ) plays a vital role in soil mechanics. These parameters are often used in quantification\
    \ of soil strength and thereby play an important role in designing the foundation.\
    \ In this study, direct shear tests and triaxial tests have been conducted to\
    \ investigate the shear strength parameters of alluvial soil. Four soil samples\
    \ were collected from four distinct locations (Rupsha-22\u02DA47\u201958.01\u201D\
    \ N, 89\u02DA34\u201945.82\u201D E; Boyra-22\u02DA50\u201930.33\u201D N, 89\u02DA\
    32\u2019.63\u201D E; Sonadanga-22\u02DA49\u20197\u201D.00\u201D N, 89\u02DA32\u2019\
    47.07\u201D E; Fulbarigate 22\u02DA53\u201956.90\u201D N89\u02DA32\u201947.07\u201D\
    \ E) of Khulna. Test results show a significant change in the value of the internal\
    \ friction angle of the soil samples while its shear strength parameter is measured\
    \ by a direct shear test compared to triaxial testing on the undisturbed specimen.\
    \ Whereas, the discrepancy of results is less significant for samples in remoulded\
    \ conditions. The disparity of shear strength results obtained by different test\
    \ methods has been explained by analyzing soil sample structure at different states.</em>"
