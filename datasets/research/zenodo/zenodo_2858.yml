  title: Dynamics Of The Quantity Of Agronomically Valuable Groups Of Microorganisms
    During Cultivation Of Maize On Sod-Podzolic Sandy Loam Soil
  abstract: "The influence of biofertilizers (Polyfunkur and Agromik) on agronomically\
    \ valuable groups of microorganisms on sod\u2013podzolic sandy loam soil is considered\
    \ in order to determine their amount depending on the phases of maize development.\n\
    \nMethods: phenological, agrochemical, microbiological.\n\nStudy was carried out\
    \ on sod\u2013podzolic sandy loamy soil. The amount of bacteria in both fertilized\
    \ test and the control was almost the same in the Polifunkur test during the tillering\
    \ phase. The amount of autochthonous oligotrophs in the control was 1.5 times\
    \ higher than in Polyfunkur test. The amount of the other seven agronomically\
    \ valuable groups prevailed in Polyfunkur. In the Agromik test, the total amount\
    \ of eight of nine agronomically valuable groups was higher than in the control.\n\
    \nDuring the beginning of flowering and the cob\u2013forming phase, the amount\
    \ of agronomically valuable groups of microorganisms was higher in the fertilized\
    \ soil than in the control."
