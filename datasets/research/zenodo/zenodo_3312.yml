  title: Soil Organic Matter in Dryland Ecosystems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Drylands are regions with low rainfall, high temperatures and
    very high evapotranspiration, as well as limited plant biomass production. Covering
    more than 45% of the Earth&rsquo;s land surface and being inhabited by more than
    35% of the world population, drylands are of paramount importance for global sustainability.
    Among the many factors that influence the ability of drylands to provide essential
    ecosystem services, soil organic matter deserves special attention. This chapter
    provides an overview of the quantity of soil organic matter in dryland ecosystems,
    the main factors regulating its formation and conservation, its vulnerability
    to ongoing global changes, and existing options to preserve or even enhance this
    essential natural resource.&lt;/p&gt;'
