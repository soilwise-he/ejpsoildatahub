  title: Status And Management Of Grape Stem Borer, Celosterna Scrabrator With Soil
    Application Of Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 Gr
  abstract: Grape stem borer, <em>Celosterna scrabrator </em>is an important production
    constraint in grapes in India. Hitherto this pest was a severe menace only on
    the aged and unmanaged fields but during the recent past it has also started damaging
    the newly established fields. In India, since Karnataka, Andra Pradesh, Tamil
    Nadu and Maharashtra are the major grape production states, the incidence of stem
    borer is also restricted and severe in these states. The grubs of the beetle bore
    in to the main stem and even the branches, which affect the translocation of nutrients
    to the areal parts of the plant. Since, the grubs bore inside the stem, the chewed
    material along with its excreta is discharged outside the holes and the frass
    is found on the ground just below the bored holes. The portion of vines above
    the damaged part has a sticky appearance. The leaves become pale yellow which
    looks like a deficiency of micronutrients. The leaves ultimately dry and drop
    down. The status of the incidence of the grape stem borer in different grape growing
    districts of Northern Karnataka was carried out during three years. In each taluka
    five locations were surveyed for the incidence of grape stem borer. Further, the
    experiment on management of stem borer was carried out in the grape gardens of
    Vijayapur districts under farmers field during three years. Stem borer infested
    plants that show live holes were selected per treatments and it was replicated
    three times. Live and dead holes observed during pre-treatment were closely monitored
    and only plants with live holes were selected and tagged. Different doses of chlorantraniliprole
    0.4% GR were incorporated into the soil around the vine basins near root zone
    surrounded to trunk region by removing soils up to 5-10 cm with a peripheral distance
    of 1 to 1.5 feet from the main trunk where feeder roots are present. Irrigation
    was followed after application of insecticide for proper incorporation of the
    test chemical. The results indicated that there was sever to moderate incidence
    of the stem borer in all the grape growing districts of northern Karnataka. Maximum
    incidence was recorded in Belagavi (11 holes per vine) and minimum was in Gadag
    district (8.5 holes per vine). The investigations carried out to study the efficacy
    of chlorantraniliprole on grape stem borer for successive three years under farmers
    field indicated that chlorantraniliprole @ 15g/vine applied just near the active
    root zone of the plant followed by irrigation has successfully managed the pest.
    The insecticide has translocated to all the parts of the plants and thereby stopped
    the activity of the pest which has resulted in to better growth of the plant and
    higher berry yield compared to other treatments under investigation. Thus, chlorantraniliprole
    0.4 GR @ 15g/vine can be effective means in managing the stem borer.
