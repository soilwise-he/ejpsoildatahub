  title: Study on Fatigue and Rutting Behaviour of Flexible Pavement as a result of
    marble dust addition in subgrade soil
  abstract: <em>The utilization of industrial waste to enhance soil properties is
    a cost-effective and efficient approach that also addresses waste disposal issues.
    Thus, understanding the properties of these wastes is crucial to evaluate their
    performance.</em> <em>This study investigated the addition of waste marble dust
    to stabilize soil classified as CL based on the Indian Standard Classification
    system (ISCS). The soil was mixed with marble dust at 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% by
    weight, and the index properties were determined at each percentage. California
    Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) were calculated
    at Optimum Moisture Content (OMC), which was determined by Proctor test for both
    modified and parent soil.</em> <em>The results indicated that 20% waste marble
    dust was optimal for strengthening the parent soil. Furthermore, an evaluation
    was conducted to compare the observed CBR value with the predicted CBR value calculated
    through regression analysis using SPSS. Resilient Modulus was also determined
    for subgrade soils using equations specified by the Transportation and Road Research
    Laboratory. Based on the obtained results, pavement thickness was determined for
    designing flexible pavement sections according to IRC 37-2012 using IITPAVE. The
    use of waste materials for soil improvement is becoming increasingly popular in
    construction projects due to its economic and environmental benefits. Waste materials,
    such as marble dust, which would otherwise be discarded as landfill can be harnessed
    for sustainable use in construction. </em>
