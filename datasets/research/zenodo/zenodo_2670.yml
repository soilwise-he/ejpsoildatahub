  title: Isolation and characterization of 3rd Generation Cephalosporin Resistant
    Gram-positive bacteria from urban environmental soil of West Bengal, India
  abstract: Abundance of antibiotic resistance in natural environmental flora in recent
    years has become a threat to public health. Various studies during the last decade
    have shown that the soil micro flora is a huge reservoir of antibiotic resistant
    bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). These environmental resistome
    is in continuous equilibrium with clinical pathogens with exchange of antibiotic
    resistance factors through horizontal gene transfer. Anthropogenic activity has
    significantly increased this telltale series of exchange. Therefore, urban environmental
    soils are perfect study materials to find environmental ARB and ARGs which may
    lead to a better understanding of evolution of antibiotic resistance. In this
    report we discuss about the isolation and characterization of a third generation
    cephalosporin resistant Gram positive isolate from urban environmental soil. Moreover,
    the ability of the bacteria to form biofilm in presence or absence of antibiotic
    has also been discussed.
