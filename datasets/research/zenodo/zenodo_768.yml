  title: EVALUATION AND MODELING OF SOIL WIND EROSION USING GAT TECHNOLOGIES
  abstract: <strong><em>Abstract.</em></strong><em> One type of degradation is wind
    erosion, and wind erosion is a global problem. Ensuring food security and maintaining
    soil fertility is one of the most important tasks facing the world community today.
    Wind erosion is one of the largest factors affecting soil fertility in the world.
    In recent years, scientists have made great efforts to prevent this process and
    determine the extent of the damage caused. The concept of modeling soil wind erosion
    with the help of modern GAT technologies has entered science. To date, there are
    several types of modeling that help determine the rate of wind erosion through
    modeling and determine the effectiveness of erosion control measures. We have
    devoted this article to the consideration of wind erosion models of the RWEQ and
    WEPS types.</em>
