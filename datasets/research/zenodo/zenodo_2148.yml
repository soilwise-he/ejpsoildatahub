  title: The use of environmentally secure means of biological reclamation in order
    to prevent soil degradation processes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The article shows the importance of high-tech organic fertilizers
    of the new generation on the example of multi-purpose compost in the maintenance
    and reproduction of soil fertility. With increasing degradation of the soil cover
    of arable land, such fertilizers in combination with other means of farming systems
    with bio meliorative properties (perennial grasses, green manures, phytomeliorants),
    intensively activating soil microflora, affecting agrochemical and water&ndash;physical
    properties, can quickly restore and optimize the basis of fertility &mdash; soil
    organic matter. Therefore, in modern agriculture in the last 15&ndash;20 years,
    preference is given to the&nbsp;production of non-traditional high-tech biologically
    active and environmentally friendly organic fertilizers (composts) obtained by
    the method of bioconversion of organic raw materials. In the&nbsp;model experiment,
    the effect of multi-purpose compost, introduced at a dose of 15 t/ha, on the&nbsp;basic
    water&ndash;physical properties at different water regimes of dried gleyed loamy
    sod-podzolic soil was determined. The experience was laid in special vessels equipped
    with water regulating device. Studies have shown that multi-purpose compost at
    a dose of 15 t/ha by the fifth year after application, primarily affected the
    soil density of the arable layer, as well as porosity, moisture capacity, the
    amount of water readily available to plants, water permeability. So, with bilateral
    regulation of the water regime, the decrease in density was 5.8%. This, in turn,
    affected the increase in soil porosity to 4.8&ndash;5.2% and an increase in the
    reserves of productive moisture in the arable horizon. Thus, fertilizers obtained
    on the basis of the bioconversion of organic raw materials can improve soil indicators
    and help prevent degradation processes in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;'
