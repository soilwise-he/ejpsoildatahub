  title: SOIL O-LIVE Data Management Plan (HORIZON EUROPE ID 101091255)
  abstract: "This Data Management Plan (DMP) aims to outline how the project's datasets\
    \ will be managed throughout its duration and after the end of the project. It\
    \ will cover data standards and metadata, sharing, archiving preservation, and\
    \ security to ensure proper management principles are followed. This DMP describes\
    \ how research data was collected, generated, shared, and preserved in the project\
    \ context and after the end of the project, following FAIR data principles. The\
    \ data generated by the project through the different work packages (WPs) will\
    \ primarily be utilized to accomplish the objectives outlined in the project proposal.\
    \ The project will collect data from innovative observations obtained from laboratory\
    \ and/or field experiments, surveys, and assays specified in the project. Additionally,\
    \ if needed, existing data from public repositories, digital archives, and databases,\
    \ such as geographical, climatic, economic, etc., will be incorporated to complement\
    \ the project's data analysis. The nature of the SOIL OLIVE data set is diverse\
    \ in line with its multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach. It comprises\
    \ ecological data (e.g., soil biodiversity, climate, soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, land degradation estimates, restoration methodologies, and effectiveness,\
    \ etc.), agronomic data (e.g., olive yield and quality, land management, tree\
    \ physiological status, etc.), geographical data (latitude, longitude, elevation,\
    \ slope, etc.), genomic data (e.g., genetic polymorphisms, genome annotations,\
    \ genome size, chromosome number, etc.), chemical data (e.g., soil pesticide-toxicity\
    \ data, soil copper concentration, antibiotic, and microplastic pollution). Lastly,\
    \ it encompasses socio-economic data such as surveys on sustainability and market\
    \ trends related to olive oil consumption and health.\nThe DMP is a public deliverable\
    \ of the SOIL O-LIVE project. It includes initial, mid-term, and final reports\
    \ (D1.3, D1.4, and D1.5). Such deliverables will be available (i) at the internal\
    \ SOIL O-LIVE repository, which constitutes the internal Consortium document and\
    \ data repository for the project (Google\xAE Drive Tool); and (ii) at the ARGOS\
    \ platform1. In addition, a permanent link to deliverables is available on the\
    \ SOIL O-LIVE webpages (https://soilolive.eu).\nThe Joint Research Centre of the\
    \ European Commission (JRC) and the Soil O-live Consortium have a collaboration\
    \ agreement. As per this agreement, after the SOIL OLIVE project ends, they will\
    \ transfer relevant data, knowledge except, if any of the information has potential\
    \ value for exploitation, and indicators to the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and\
    \ the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC), except for any personal data collected\
    \ during the project. For this reason, relevant soil data and information will\
    \ be available also in the ESAC repository (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/datasets).\n\
    What is the purpose of the data generation or re-use and its relation to the project's\
    \ objectives?\nSOIL O-LIVE will produce various datasets of different types, including\
    \ both quantitative and qualitative data. The management of this data will aid\
    \ in achieving the project's scientific goals and disseminating its results. Two\
    \ main categories of data management are:\_\n1) Research objectives. The datasets\
    \ in this category provide all the necessary data for users to reproduce the scientific\
    \ results of the project. This encompasses experimental data (including standardized\
    \ analysis methods and agreed protocols), observations, genome annotations, computer\
    \ simulations, and data production and analysis codes. Likewise, it includes all\
    \ relevant metadata necessary for EUSO development and validation of indicators\
    \ for \"Soil health\" as listed in the implementation plan of the EU-Soil Mission.\n\
    2) Outreach, dissemination, and communications data. This collection includes\
    \ preprints, technical reports, conference presentations or abstract, educational\
    \ resources, and data related to outreach, dissemination, and communications.\
    \ However, if any of the information has potential value for exploitation, particularly\
    \ for the new prototype developed by UCLM, it will be protected by patents, copyrights,\
    \ or other appropriate means."
