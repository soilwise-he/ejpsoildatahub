  title: Effect Of Tillage Depth On Tractor Fuel Consumption Using Off-Set Disc Harrow
    In Sandy Loam Soil
  abstract: This study considered the relationship of fuel consumption and harrowing
    depth on sandy loam soil. A 2-wheel drive Massey Fergusson (MF) tractor coupled
    with off-set disc harrow was used to investigate the effect of tillage depth variation
    on tractor fuel consumption. Results showed that the tractor attached with disc
    harrow consumes 7.32, 8.60 and 9.14 liters of fuel per hectare when operated at
    10, 20 and 25 cm respectively. It has also shown that a linear relationship exists
    between fuel consumption and depth of harrow with R2 value of 0.998.
