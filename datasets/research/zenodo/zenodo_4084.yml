  title: EFFECT OF SOME OPERATION CONDITIONS FOR TRACTOR ON SOIL COMPACTION UNDER
    DIFFERENT AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS - RAS SUDR - SOUTH OF SINAI
  abstract: One of the most negative effects of the using agricultural machinery under
    inappropriate operation conditionsis the soil compaction resulting from traffic
    of tractor wheel on the soil surface during the performance of various agricultural
    processes. The accumulation of this effect leads to soil degradationand lack of
    sustainable agricultural development.Therefore, this research aims to reduce soil
    compaction, prevent soil degradation and achievement sustainable agricultural
    development by study the effect of some operations conditions for tractor (soil
    moisture content, forward speed and tires air pressure) under different agriculture
    systems (traditional agriculture and conservation agriculture). So that the field
    experiment conducted in Ras Sudr, South of Sinai Governorate (sandy loam soil)
    at three levels of soil moisture content (15%, 20% and 25%), three levels of tractor
    forward speed (3, 5 and 7) km/h and three levels of tires air pressure (50, 100
    and 150) kPa. The measurements were fuel consumption, tractor wheel slippage,
    rolling resistance, soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, average infiltration
    rate, soil surface sinkage, soil layer deformation and sorghum yield (fresh forage).
    The results showed that significant effect of all study treatments on soil compaction
    which, resulting from traffic of the tractortires under two agriculture systems.The
    results showed that, conservation agriculture system achieved the largest decreasing
    of power requirements and more resistance to soil compaction compared to the traditional
    agriculture system. Where, conservation agriculture system decreased fuel consumption,
    tractor wheel slippage, rolling resistance and soil surface sinkage about of 72%,
    75%, 38% and 57% respectively, compared to traditional agriculture system. The
    results indicated to, soil bulk density and soil penetration resistance increased
    in both of two agriculture systems in traffic zones compared to no-traffic zones
    but these increasing in the traditional agriculture system were greater than in
    the conservation agriculture system. Where the increasing of soil bulk density
    and soil penetration resistance in traffic zones compared to no-traffic zones
    were about of 37% and 96% respectively, for traditional agriculture system and
    about of 15% and 31% respectively, for conservation agriculture system. In general,
    the results showed that average infiltration rate decreased in traffic zones compared
    to no-traffic zones for two agriculture systems, but the decreasing in traditional
    agriculture system was greater than conservation agriculture system. Where, the
    decreasing of average infiltration rate in traffic zones was about of 62% compared
    to no-traffic zones for traditional agriculture system and about of 39% for conservation
    agriculture system. The soil layer deformation measured for three soil layers
    (0:7, 7:14 and 14:21) cm and the results showed that all soil layers deformation
    increased in traffic zones but the soil surface layer was the largest increasing
    in deformation compared to the deeper layers for both of two agriculture systems.
    The average deformation of the soil layers in conservation agriculture system
    was lower than in the traditional agriculture system about of 55%. In general,
    sorghum crop yield affected by increasing soil compaction and its productivity
    decreased about of 46% and 41% in the traffic zones of tractor tires compared
    to no-traffic zones for traditional agriculture system and conservation agriculture
    system respectively. According to the experimental results, the best treatment,
    which achieved the high resistance to the compaction and the greatest yield of
    the sorghum crop, was the moisture content 15%, tractor forward speed 7 km/h and
    tire air pressure 50 kPa. This is the best treatment in the both of agriculture
    systems but the conservation agriculture system was the best to resistance the
    soil compaction. Despite the increasing in the crop yield in the traditional agricultural
    system compared to the conservation agriculture system, about of 5% during one
    agricultural season, the yield in the conservation system is expected to increase
    by continuous application to more than one agricultural season.
