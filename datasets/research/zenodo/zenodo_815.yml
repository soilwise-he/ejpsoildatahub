  title: IOT and Machine Learning Based Soil Moisture Prediction and Monitoring
  abstract: "Agriculture plays a crucial role in the overall growth of the nation.\
    \ Around 70% of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on irrigation,\
    \ while about one-third of the country\u2019s (India) revenue is obtained from\
    \ agriculture. Even so, the demand for food is increasing day by day and may continue\
    \ to do so for decades. To solve this exceeding demand a feasible solution would\
    \ be to use smart-farming techniques to enhance effectiveness and productivity\
    \ and reduce manual labour, latency and overall expenses. But the farmers in the\
    \ developing nation mainly rely on the traditional farming methods as they smart-farming\
    \ techniques are expensive. Our paper addresses this issue of affordability by\
    \ incorporating IoT and machine learning-based design that will help farmers monitor\
    \ the soil quality based on the moisture content present. This paper proposes\
    \ a system which will monitor the environmental factors using IoT and determine\
    \ the moisture content of the soil. With the help of the data accumulated, machine\
    \ learning is used to predict the future soil moisture. And lastly, a basic GUI\
    \ is implemented to take environmental parameters as input and output of the soil\
    \ moisture"
