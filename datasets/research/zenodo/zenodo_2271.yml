  title: Effect of a traction-assist winch on wheel slippage and machine induced soil
    disturbance in flat terrain
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Recently, forest operations are facing unfavorable climatic
    conditions more frequently. In Central Europe,&lt;br&gt;

    machine trafficability and induced soil disturbances are negatively affected by
    periods of high precipitation&lt;br&gt;

    and less intensive frost during ground-based harvesting operations. Winch-assist
    technology is&lt;br&gt;

    assumed to reduce soil disturbance by forest machines in steep terrain. Still,
    the potential positive effects&lt;br&gt;

    of winches to assist traction of forest machines in flat terrain have rarely been
    surveyed. In this study,&lt;br&gt;

    a field trial was conducted in flat terrain (slope &lt; 5%). There, a forwarder
    with an integrated traction-assist&lt;br&gt;

    was monitored during six consecutive machine passes on a permanent machine operating
    trail. The first&lt;br&gt;

    section of the machine operating trail was passed without traction-assist, the
    remaining section with&lt;br&gt;

    traction-assist, resulting in two treatment groups. To assess soil impacts, three
    test plots were positioned&lt;br&gt;

    per treatment group. Within these plots, pre- and post-operational soil bulk density,
    soil displacement and&lt;br&gt;

    rutting were determined. Additionally, wheel slippage and cable tensile force
    were examined, using&lt;br&gt;

    incremental rotary encoders and a flexible tensile force measurement kit, respectively.
    It was observed,&lt;br&gt;

    that wheel slippage responded inversely with tensile force. Traction-assist technology
    reduced wheel&lt;br&gt;

    slippage from 5.3&plusmn;11.9% to 0.37&plusmn;10.19% along the section of the
    machine operating trail, as compared&lt;br&gt;

    to results from the unassisted section. Although wheel slippage was significantly
    reduced, no mitigating&lt;br&gt;

    effect by the usage of traction-assist technology on soil disturbance could be
    observed, probably due to&lt;br&gt;

    the low volumetric water content of 27%.&lt;/p&gt;'
