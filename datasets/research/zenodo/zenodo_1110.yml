  title: METHOD FOR PRODUCING STABLE GEOECOLOGICALLY STABLE SOIL MIXTURES BASED ON
    DRILLING.
  abstract: "drilling in vain and drilling trails do not do through natural geosystems\
    \ pollution problems gift situation showing scientific, technical and patent literature\
    \ analysis was carried out and analytical commentary prepared, studied the raw\
    \ subject matter features, as well as research methods and experience to perform\
    \ methods description considering _ Research chemical methods ( inductive coupled\
    \ plasma with atom emission spectrometry, IR spectrometry, titration, precipitation),\
    \ X-ray phase, microstructure analysis and physics and mechanical (moisture, liquid\
    \ and rolling on the moisture boundary) determination methods using increased\
    \ _ \xADK shear ring methods used without density, pycnometric method, compression\
    \ compression method with deformation modulus) and toxicological characteristics\
    \ (aqueous extracts toxicity scientific level and daphnia in performance change\
    \ and chlorophyll fluorescence level change according to the definition of methods\
    \ using biotest. water herb cell number) . Experimental information mathematician\
    \ again work special software supply using , basic statistics methods and from\
    \ laws used without done increased"
