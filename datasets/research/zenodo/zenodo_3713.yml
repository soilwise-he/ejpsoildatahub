  title: Strength, Swell And Seepage Characterstics Of Flyash And Cement Modified
    Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: Infrastructure projects such as highways, railways embankments etc. require
    large quantities of soils for their construction. Structures like these located
    in expansive soil areas needs special attention and for the use of local materials.
    In this aspect use of stabilized materials gives are alternative solutions. Fly
    ash one such material and  can be mixed with expansive soils can be used as geotechnical
    material. Fly ash is an industrial waste obtained from thermal power plants by
    burning of coal.  In this an attempt is made for the utilization of Fly ash with
    cement in bulk quantities by adding these to expansive soil and tests like plasticity,
    swell potential, permeability and UCS were performed. From the test results it
    is identified that addition of Fly ash and cement decreases plasticity and improves
    strength characteristics. Addition of Fly ash-cement attain high compressive strength
    values of 2.55-3.72kPa and improves the seepage characteristics.
