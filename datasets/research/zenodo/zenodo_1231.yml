  title: Comparison of thermal tolerance in Collembola (Hexapoda) inhabiting soil
    and subterranean habitats
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that trogloxenes inhabiting surface habitats,\
    \ thermally fluctuating environment, would tolerate wide temperature ranges. We\
    \ expected that the temperature tolerances would diminish over categories trogloxene\
    \ - subtroglophile - eutroglophile - troglobiont as a result of the degree of\
    \ adaptation to subterranean environment that is characteristic with thermally\
    \ stable conditions. We also assumed that body size may play crucial role in tolerance\
    \ of Collembola to high and low temperature. Eighteen species of all four categories\
    \ were exposed to one-hour survival laboratory test. The impact of temperature,\
    \ species and species-temperature interaction on the cold and heat survival was\
    \ statistically significant. The species heat tolerance significantly increased\
    \ with increasing cold tolerance. In general, decrease in cold and heat tolerance\
    \ was shown from trogloxenes, over subtroglophiles and eutroglophiles to troglobionts.\
    \ Cryptic species  &lt;em&gt;Folsomia&lt;/em&gt;  sp. among trogloxenes and  &lt;em&gt;Ceratophysella\
    \ sigillata, Hypogastrura crassaegranulata&lt;/em&gt;  among subtroglophiles were\
    \ highly heat- and also cold-resistant, showing wide ecological plasticity. Subtroglophilous\
    \  &lt;em&gt;Tetrodontophora bielanensis&lt;/em&gt;  and  &lt;em&gt;Lepidocyrtus\
    \ violaceus&lt;/em&gt;, eutroglophilous  &lt;em&gt;Heteromurus nitidus&lt;/em&gt;\
    \  and troglobiont  &lt;em&gt;Protaphorura janosik&lt;/em&gt;  were the most cold-sensitive\
    \ species, and all troglobionts and eutroglophilous  &lt;em&gt;Pygmarrhopalites\
    \ pygmaeus&lt;/em&gt;  as the most heat-sensitive species. Species belonging to\
    \ ecological groups not or less associated to cave environment (trogloxenes and\
    \ subtroglophiles) showed wider range of temperature tolerance in comparison with\
    \ more cave adapted species (eutroglophiles and troglobionts), tested by ANOVA.\
    \ Cold resistance decreased significantly with increasing body length, indicating\
    \ that body size plays an important role in temperature tolerances of arthropods\
    \ inhabiting soil and subterranean habitats.\_&lt;/p&gt;"
