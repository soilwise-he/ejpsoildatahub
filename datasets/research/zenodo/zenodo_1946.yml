  title: Plant Parasitic Nematodes in Rice Fields Under Freshwater and Saline Soil
    Conditions in Orissa, India
  abstract: This article 'Plant Parasitic Nematodes in Rice Fields Under Freshwater
    and Saline Soil Conditions in Orissa, India' appeared in the International Rice
    Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
