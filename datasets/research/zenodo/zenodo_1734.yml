  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The objective of the study was to evaluate soil quality in population
    centers near gold mining areas. The concentration of heavy metals and metalloids
    (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was analyzed in soil samples collected in public
    areas, yards, gardens, and cultivation areas. As a result, it was identified that
    the concentration of Ni and Cr exceeded the maximum permissible limit (MPL) established
    in the Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation of Ecuador (TULSMA)
    in 100 % of the samples analyzed, while the concentration of Cu and Zn was higher
    than the MPL in 90 % of the sites sampled. Cd exceeded the MPL in 64 % of the
    samples, and As and Pb exceeded the MPL in 26 % and 21 % of the samples, respectively.
    Cd, As and Pb are elements of special concern due to their high toxicity and significant
    presence in the study area. Regarding pH analysis, values between 3.31 and 8.21
    were obtained, indicating acidic conditions in 60 % of the soil samples, possibly
    as a result of anthropogenic activity in the area. Strong positive correlations
    were detected between As-Cd, Cr-Ni, Cu-Ni, and moderate correlations between Cr-Cu
    and Pb-Zn, which is related to the mineralization of the area. Cluster analysis
    indicated that cluster C1, characterized by a high content of potentially toxic
    elements, is mostly located south of the study area. These preliminary results
    can serve as a baseline for future research in the area, highlighting the importance
    of soil quality assessment in mining areas.&lt;/p&gt;'
