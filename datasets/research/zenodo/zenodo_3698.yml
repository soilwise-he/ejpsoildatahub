  title: Soil Organic Matter Dynamics Upon Secondary Succession in Imperata Grassland,
    East Kalimantan, Indonesia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics upon secondary succession
    in &lt;em&gt;Imperata&lt;/em&gt; grassland was studied by stable carbon isotope
    analysis. The data of litter and soil samples of twenty plots in four different
    stages of succession were compared. These different stages were represented by
    plots that were; (1) last burned 3 years before sampling (&lt;em&gt;Imperata&lt;/em&gt;
    grassland), (2) last burned 9 years before, (3) a secondary forest (&ge;15 years)
    and (4) a primary forest. &nbsp;Result showed that isotopic signatures of all
    soil horizons of the regeneration stages were statistically different from those
    of the primary forest. The A-horizon under the 3-years &lt;em&gt;Imperata &lt;/em&gt;plot
    still contained 23% forest (C3) carbon, and this fraction increased to 51% in
    the-B-horizon. In the 9-years plot and in the secondary forest, the C3 carbon
    on the A-horizon increased to 51% and 96%, respectively. &nbsp;In the topsoil,
    the loss of C4-C between the 3-years and the 9-years plot was significant, while
    it appeared negligible in the AB-horizon. The strong decay in the topsoil under
    &lt;em&gt;Imperata&lt;/em&gt; grassland may be due to the rather high carbohydrate
    content of the SOM, which is considered easily decomposable. Further research
    is needed especially to explore the relation between carbon stocks and chemical
    of SOM composition. Such insight may help to better understand and predict soil
    carbon changes in relation to climate and vegetation change.&lt;/p&gt;'
