  title: A Field Study on Stabilizing Desert Sandy Soil with A Developed Environmentally
    Friendly Polymer
  abstract: This field study introduces a developed emulsion polymer for serving light
    and medium loading traffic. The polymer has a previous laboratory study that recommended
    its concentrations for mixing and coating. The polymer has been used to stabilize
    only a thin layer of a desert route with a thickness of 8 cm over a compacted
    sandy layer of 22 cm. The measurements conducted on the stabilized soil showed
    that the reaction modulus increased by 411%. The compressive strength increased
    and the water absorption decreased with the increase of stabilization curing period
    up to 28 days. The California bearing ratio increased by 425%, while it decreased
    after submerging in water for 4 days and lost 25% of its achieved value. The field
    investigation revealed that the light and medium loading vehicles up to 22 tons
    did not cause any damage in the stabilized layer during moving. However, the vehicle
    of 22 tons caused little damage with an impact load on the thin paved layer. It
    is concluded that the used stabilizer polymer can serve the light and medium loading
    traffic with a thicker layer section and improving the quality assurance of implementation.
