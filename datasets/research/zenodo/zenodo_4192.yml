  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;White yam (Dioscorea rotundata) was planted in the abandoned
    quarry to determine the growth and yield effects of mycorrhizal fungi, green manure,
    and other soil amendments. Seed yams were planted on the heaps (1 m &times; 1
    m) in three replicates and three blocks. Data collected were analyzed using analysis
    of variance and Duncan multiple range test. The results showed that Glomus mosseae,
    Glomus etunicatum, green manure of Gliricidia sepium (GS), poultry manure, and
    NPK fertilizer influence yam&rsquo;s shoot, root, and tuber weights. It was further
    observed that the combined treatments of GS and Leucaena leucocephala had better
    enhancement of growth and yield characters of yam. Biofertilizers together with
    plant and animal remains are therefore recommended for the bioremediation of quarry
    and other areas affected by natural, human, or ecological activities.&lt;/p&gt;'
