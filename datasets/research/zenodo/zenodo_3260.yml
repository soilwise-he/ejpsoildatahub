  title: 'Extraction of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB''s) in Soil, Maize and Water
    Due to Disposal of Pharmaceuticals in Dumpsite within Lagos and Environ Using
    Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectromtry (GCMS): A Global Concern'
  abstract: "<strong>The Levels, distributions of mean concentrations of (PCB\u2019\
    S) classified under persistent organic pollutants POP in soil, Maize and water\
    \ samples was determined using Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS).\
    \ A range of 27 PCB congeners with low, medium and high concentration were widely\
    \ distributed and detected in all the analysed samples. The results obtained showed\
    \ wide distribution of PCB\u2019s with high concentration at the control sites\
    \ than dump site, which made control site more sup citable and exposure to chemical\
    \ hazard. This however may lead to negative impact in the environment most especially\
    \ schools, communities and farmland as the results are above their threshold values\
    \ found in the literatures. The PCB 8 in water sample at Epe control site (13.15\
    \ \xB1 12.271) PCB 44 in water control site at Olusosun (0.012 \xB1 0.016) were\
    \ considered to be high in all the sites.</strong>"
