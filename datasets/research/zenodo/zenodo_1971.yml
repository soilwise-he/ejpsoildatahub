  title: 'A Review: Vital Role of Biofertilizers in Plant Growth Enhancement and Maintenance
    of Soil Health'
  abstract: Biofertilizers are also being used to help farmers change their fortunes.
    In several developed countries, it has proved to be a promising technology, however
    in developing countries; the use of bioinoculants is limited by a number of factors.
    Scientific understanding of bioinoculants and their use can pave the way for their
    successful application. A biofertilizer is a material that includes living microorganisms
    that colonise the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant when added to plants,
    plant surfaces, or soil, and foster growth by growing the supply or availability
    of primary nutrients to the host plant. Biofertilizers provide nutrients to plants
    by natural processes such as nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and
    the production of growth-promoting compounds. Biofertilizers use microorganisms
    to maintain the soil's natural nitrogen balance and increase soil organic matter.
    Good plants may be cultivated through the use of biofertilizers while still improving
    the soil's sustainability and protection. Biofertilizers would likely limit the
    usage of conventional fertilizers and chemicals, but they will not be able to
    completely eliminate them. Plant-growth enhancing rhizobacteria is a preferred
    scientific name for these helpful bacteria since they perform several functions
    (PGPR).
