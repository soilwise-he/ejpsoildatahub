  title: Bacterial Diversity in Soybean Rhizosphere Soil at Seedling and Mature Stages
  abstract: AbstractChanges in the structural diversity of bacterial communities in
    soybean rhizospheres play important roles in plant growth and crop productivity.
    However, there are only a few studies on different soybean growth stages. Here,
    we investigated the changes in the bacterial community of soybean rhizosphere
    soil at two stages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The results showed
    that the bacterial abundance and diversity in the seeding stage were higher than
    those in the mature stage and that the diversity changed significantly. Actinobacteria,
    Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in the soybean rhizosphere
    soil. Additionally, changes in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria abundances showed
    opposite trends.
