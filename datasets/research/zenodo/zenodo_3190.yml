  title: Comparison of brown soil of different exposures in the area of the national
    park "Una" with special emphasis on the distribution of cadmium, nickel and arsenic
  abstract: "The paper presented results of a comparison of brown soils of different\
    \ exposures at two different sites within the National Park \u201EUna\u201C. The\
    \ sites were related to the southwestern exposure (SW) and the northeastern exposure\
    \ (NE) of the same land use (orchard). The main objective of the research, in\
    \ addition to the physical and chemical parameters of soil quality, was to determine\
    \ the distribution of the total content of cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and arsenic\
    \ (As). The total content of these elements werw observed in composite samples\
    \ at two depths of 0 \u2013 10 and 0 \u2013 20 cm and horizons profile. Their\
    \ total content was measured by atomic adsorption spectrometry \u2013 AAS. The\
    \ results were statistically analyzed using Kruskal - Walisovog test at the significance\
    \ level of p \u2264 0.05 using correlation coefficient \u03C7<sup>2</sup>. The\
    \ results showed a single legality of the distribution of Cd, Ni and As in samples\
    \ of soil profile, while the average soil samples showed unique legality of the\
    \ distribution of observed elements."
