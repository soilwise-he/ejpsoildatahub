  title: Long-term effectiveness of sustainable land management practices to control
    runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss and the role of rainfall intensity in
    Mediterranean rainfed agroecosystems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean environments are especially susceptible to soil
    erosion and to inappropriate soil management, leading to accelerated soil loss.
    Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices (such as reduced tillage, no-tillage,
    cover crops, etc.,) have the potential to reduce soil, organic carbon (OC), and
    nutrient losses by erosion. However, the effectivity of these practices is site-dependent
    and varies under different rainfall conditions. The objective of this paper was
    to evaluate the effects of SLM practices &ndash; in two rainfed systems (a wheat
    field and an almond orchard) representative of a large area of the driest Mediterranean
    regions - on runoff, soil erosion, particle size distribution, and OC and nutrient
    (N and P) contents in sediments. The influence of the rainfall characteristics
    on the effectiveness of the SLM practices was also evaluated. The SLM implemented
    were: reduced tillage (RT) in the wheat field and almond orchard and reduced tillage
    combined with green manure (RTG) in the almond orchard; these were compared to
    conventional tillage, the usual practice in the area. Open erosion plots were
    set up to monitor the effects of SLM on soil carbon and nutrients and on soil
    erosion after each rainfall event over six years (2010&ndash;2016). The results
    show that the SLM practices evaluated resulted in increased organic carbon (OC)
    and nutrients (N and P) contents in the soil, and reduced runoff, erosion, and
    mobilization of organic carbon and nutrients in sediments. Reductions in runoff
    of 30% and 65% and decreases in erosion of 65 and 85% were found in the wheat
    field and almond orchards, respectively. In addition, the total OC, N, and P losses
    in the wheat field were reduced by 56%, 45%, and 64%, respectively, while in the
    almond field the OC, N, and P losses were reduced by 90% under RT and by 85% under
    RTG.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The beneficial effect of the SLM practices on soil erosion was observed
    within 18&nbsp;months of their implementation and continued throughout the six
    years of the study. Furthermore, the effectiveness of tillage reduction with respect
    to erosion control and carbon and nutrients mobilization was highest during the
    most intense rainfall events, which are responsible for the highest erosion rates
    in Mediterranean areas. Our results support the key role of SLM practices under
    semiarid conditions as useful tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation,
    given the expected increase in high-intensity rainfall events in semiarid areas.&lt;/p&gt;'
