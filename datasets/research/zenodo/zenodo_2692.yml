  title: Effects of the application of an organic amendment and nanoscale zero-valent
    iron particles on soil Cr(VI) remediation
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is the main pollutant associated to laying hen facilities. Best
    Available Techniques such as manure drying tunnels have been implemented to minimise
    ammonia losses. However, scarce information is available about their performance
    as a cleaner technology. Ammonia emission from a manure-belt laying hen building
    and the annexed external manure drying tunnel were measured from July 2015 to
    October 2016 under Continental Mediterranean climate conditions. Ammonia emission
    from the building and manure drying tunnel were continuously measured by a photoacoustic
    multi gas analyser. Temperature and relative humidity were monitored. The uncertainty
    of ammonia emission calculation was examined. Nitrogen mass balance was also used
    to estimate ammonia losses from the building. Results showed that the annual mean
    ammonia emission from the building was 93.8 mg ammonia d&minus;1 hen&minus;1.
    Mean ammonia emission uncertainty in the building was 9.7% throughout the sampling
    period. Ventilation rate was identified as the main factor affecting uncertainty
    due to the variability of fans operation. Concerning the manure drying tunnel,
    mean ammonia emission was 209.3 mg NH3 d&minus;1 hen&minus;1. Ammonia losses were
    affected by the atmospheric temperature and relative humidity, and manure dry
    matter content in both systems. Manure ammonia emission should be researched in
    following steps of the manure continuum to state the manure drying tunnel as a
    cleaner production technology. Ammonia emission estimation by nitrogen mass balance
    method was 98.4 mg NH3 d&minus;1 hen&minus;1. It was demonstrated to be a good
    indicator of the ammonia emission over the year although it did not reflect the
    variations between shorter time periods. &copy; 2019 Elsevier Ltd&lt;br&gt;
