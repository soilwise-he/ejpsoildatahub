  title: Spatial Variability Analysis of Soil Properties Using Geospatial Technique
    in Katni District of Madhya Pradesh, India
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted in Katni district of Madhya Pradesh\
    \ India to map the spatial variability of major soil properties using geospatial\
    \ technique. Surface soil samples of 505 locations (0-15 cm) were collected by\
    \ random sampling strategy using GPS. Soil physico-chemical properties were measured\
    \ in laboratory. In this paper we execute and compare the accuracy of various\
    \ ordinary kriging methods. Spatial variability of soil physico-chemical properties\
    \ was quantified through semi-variogram analysis and the relevant surface maps\
    \ were prepared through ordinary kriging. Exponential model fits well with experimental\
    \ semi-variogram of pH, OC, available N, P, K, S and Zn, where as in case of electric\
    \ conductivity best fitted model was spherical. Coefficient of variation of soil\
    \ properties showed large variability with greatest variation observed\_ in Zn\
    \ (140%) while EC, OC, N, P, and K has displayed moderate spatial variation whereas\
    \ the smallest variation was in pH (14.16% ). In case of EC and P the goodness\
    \ of prediction (G) had a negative value while N, P, K, pH, Zn and S shows positive\
    \ value. The pH value in north-east part of the study area was alkaline and in\
    \ the south-west portion of area was acidic in nature. Correlation coefficient\
    \ between soil nutrients shows strong positive relationship between Nitrogen and\
    \ organic carbon (r= 0.955). Cross validation of kriged map shows that spatial\
    \ prediction of soil nutrients using semi-variogram parameters is better than\
    \ assuming mean of observed value for any un-sampled location.&lt;/p&gt;"
