  title: 'Soil-nutrient availability under a global-change scenario in a Mediterranean
    mountain ecosystem: SOIL NUTRIENTS UNDER A GLOBAL CHANGE SCENARIO'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Changes in rainfall availability will alter soil-nutrient availability
    under a climate-change scenario. However, studies have usually analyzed the effect
    of either drier or wetter soil conditions, despite the fact that both possibilities
    will coexist in many climatic regions of the world. Furthermore, its effect may
    vary across the different habitats of the ecosystem. We experimentally investigated
    the effect of three contrasting climatic scenarios on different carbon (C), nitrogen
    (N), and phosphorus (P) fractions in soil and microbial compartments among three
    characteristic habitats in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem: forest, shrubland,
    and open areas. The climatic scenarios were dry summers, according to the 30%
    summer rainfall reduction projected in the Mediterranean; wet summer, simulating
    summer storms to reach the maximum historical records in the study area; and current
    climatic conditions (control). Sampling was replicated during two seasons (spring
    and summer) and 2 years. The climatic scenario did not affect the nutrient content
    in the litter layer. However, soil and microbial nutrients varied among seasons,
    habitats, and climatic scenarios. Soil-nutrient fractions increased with lower
    soil-moisture conditions (dry scenario and summer), whereas microbial nutrients
    increased under the wet summer scenario and spring. This pattern was consistent
    both studied years, although it was modulated by habitat, differences being lower
    with denser plant cover. Holm oak seedlings, used as live control of the experiment,
    tended to increase their N and P content (although not significantly) with water
    availability. Thus, the results support the idea that higher rainfall boosts microbial
    and plant-nutrient uptake, and hence nutrient cycling. By contrast, a rainfall
    reduction leads to an accumulation of nutrients in the soil, increasing the risk
    of nutrient loss by leaching or erosion. These results show that the projected
    climate change will have significant effects on nutrient cycles, and therefore
    will have important implications on the ecosystem functioning.&lt;/p&gt;'
