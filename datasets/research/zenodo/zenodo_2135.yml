  title: Estimation of standard penetration test value on cohesive soil using artificial
    neural network without data normalization
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often used recently by
    researchers to solve complex and nonlinear problems. Standard penetration test
    (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT) are field tests that are often used to obtain
    soil parameters. There have been many previous studies that examined the value
    obtained through the SPT test with the CPT test, but the research carried out
    still uses equations that are linear. This research will conduct an estimated
    value of SPT on cohesive soil using CPT data in the form of end resistance and
    blanket resistance, and laboratory test data such as effective overburden pressure,
    liquid limit, plastic limit and percentage of sand, silt and clay. This study
    used 242 data with testing areas in several cities on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.
    The developed artificial neural network will be created without data normalization.
    The final results of this study are in the form of root mean square error (RMSE)
    values 3.441, mean absolute error (MAE) 2.318 and R2 0.9451 for training data
    and RMSE 2.785, MAE 2.085, R2 0.9792 for test data. The RMSE, MAE and R2 values
    in this study indicate that the ANN that has been developed is considered quite
    good and efficient in estimating the SPT value.&lt;/p&gt;'
