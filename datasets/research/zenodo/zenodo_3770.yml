  title: Carbon Cycles, Nitrogen Fixation and the Legume-Rhizobia Symbiosis as Soil
    Contaminant Biotest System
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The major pools and turnover &nbsp;rates of the global carbon
    (C) cycles are presented and compared to the human production of CO2 &nbsp;from
    the burning of fossil fuels (e.g. coal and oil) and geothermal &nbsp;fuels (natural
    &nbsp;gases), both categorized as non-renewable energy resources which &nbsp;in
    amount &nbsp;reaches around&nbsp; 6.5 Gigatons C per year. These pools that serve
    as C-holding stallions &nbsp;are in the atmosphere, &nbsp;the land plant biomass,
    the organic soils carbon, the ocean carbon and the lithosphere. In another related
    case, the present focus in the area of nitrogen &nbsp;fixation &nbsp;is discussed
    with &nbsp;data on world &nbsp;production of grain &nbsp;legumes &nbsp;compared
    &nbsp;to cereals production and nitrogen &nbsp;fertilizer use. The focus to understand
    &nbsp;the molecular &nbsp;biology of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis as a major
    contributor to nitrogen &nbsp;fixation &nbsp;is in the areas of signal exchange
    between &nbsp;host plants and rhizobia &nbsp;in the rhizophere including &nbsp;the
    nod factor signalling, the infection&nbsp; and nodule compartmentation and the
    soils stress factors affecting the symbiosis. The use of the Legume-Rhizobia symbiosis
    as a biotest system for soil contaminants includes data for cadmium, &nbsp;arsenate,
    atrazine, &nbsp;lindane, &nbsp;fluoranthene, phenantrene and acenaphthene and
    also results &nbsp;on the mechanism, &nbsp;why the symbiotic system is more sensitive
    &nbsp;than test systems with plant growth &nbsp;parameters.&lt;/p&gt;'
