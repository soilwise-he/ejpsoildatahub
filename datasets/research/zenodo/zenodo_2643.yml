  title: Soil moisture index estimation from landsat 8 images for prediction and monitoring
    landslide occurrences in Ulu Kelang, Selangor, Malaysia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture is one of the contributing factors that accelerates
    soil erosion and landslide events due to the increase in pore pressure which eventually
    reduces the soil strength. For landslide prediction and monitoring purposes, large-scale
    measurement involves estimating the soil moisture. However, estimation of soil
    moisture usually involves point-based measurements at a particular site and time,
    which is difficult to capture the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics.
    This paper presents the estimation of the SMI using Landsat 8 images for prediction
    and monitoring of landslide events in Ulu Kelang, Selangor. The selected SMI map
    for dry, moist, and wet seasons are obtained from climatology rainfall analysis
    over 20-year periods (19982017). SMI is assessed based on remote sensing data
    which are land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) using GIS software. Overall results indicated that rainfall distribution
    is high during inter-monsoon (IM), followed by northeast monsoon (NEM) and southwest
    monsoon (SWM) season. High rainfall distribution is a direct contributor towards
    SMI condition. Results from simulation show that April 2017 is known to have the
    highest SMI estimation season and selected to be the best SMI mapping parameter
    to be applied for prediction and monitoring of landslide events.&lt;/p&gt;'
