  title: Study of the Strain-Stress Behavior of the loess Soil and Its Numerical Modeling
    by ABAQUS
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;This research aims to conduct
    a laboratory study to clarify the behavior of creep in Loess soils with the change
    of moisture content and applied stress. Soil was brought from Joseh area (southwest
    of Homs city), and its main properties were determined, after that a series of
    tests (time dependent deformation) were carried out for the Loess soils within
    the unconfined compression test. The results showed that the change of moisture
    content and applied stress on sample have a significant effect on the properties
    of Creeping of Loess soils, and the deformations that occurred are instantaneous
    deformations at the moment of load application, and creep deformations that begin
    with the passage of time. Creep deformations can be divided into three stages:
    primary creep, stable creep, and accelerated creep. The deformations were evaluated
    using the Singh-Mitchell theory, and the results showed that the Singh-Mitchell
    theory fits well the description of deformations over time for Loess soils, where
    the relative error between the largest and smallest value did not exceed 15%.ABAQUS
    program was used to numerically describe the creep behavior of Loess soils using
    the Singh-Mitchell theory. The results showed that the Singh-Mitchell theory within
    the ABAQUS program gave more accurate values than the computational Singh-Mitchell
    theory, and the reason is that because of the program contains multiple parameters
    that describe well the properties of elasticity, plasticity and viscosity for
    any natural body.&lt;/p&gt;'
