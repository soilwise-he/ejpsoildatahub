  title: Evaluation and Promotion of Conservation Agriculture based Practices for
    Optimizing Resource Use, Better Soil Health and Climate Resilience in Rice based
    Systems of Eastern India
  abstract: "Resource intensive Green Revolution based practices in current rice based\
    \ farming have resulted in deterioration of soil, water and air quality. Monoculture\
    \ has resulted in reduced biodiversity. To address these issues, Nature based\
    \ farming/Conservation Agriculture (CA) has great potential in breathing back\
    \ life to soil and improving environment. CA practices evaluated in rice based\
    \ system in Eastern UP, India revealed direct seeded rice (DSR) with residue retention\
    \ had higher yield, profit & early maturity thus avoiding terminal heat stress\
    \ in wheat. Zero till (ZT) DSR with 150 kg N ha-1 applied as 33.3 % at 15-20 DAS\
    \ + 33.3 % at active tillering stage + 33.3 % at panicle initiation had lower\
    \ weed infestation and higher profit. ZT DSR\u2013ZT wheat with residue retention\
    \ and nutrient application based on RWCM (Rice-Wheat Crop Manager) recommendation\
    \ gave better growth, nutrient management and system productivity. 3 years of\
    \ farmers participatory on-farm trial showed increase in rice grain yield was\
    \ associated with RWCM to the tune of 10.5, 7.2 and 2.5 % over FFP, SFR and STVR,\
    \ respectively.CA practices (ZT DSR- ZT Wheat- ZT Mungbean) with residue retention\
    \ resulted 16.7 % higher rice yield & 25.6 % higher rice system yield equivalent\
    \ and climate mitigation over conventional tilled practice in irrigated rice-wheat\
    \ ecosystem. On-farm trials with CA practices showed 15-20% cost reduction and\
    \ 10-15% yield increment. DRR44, DRR42 and Sarjoo52 with direct drill seeding\
    \ on flat /furrow irrigated raised bed system (FIRB) and balanced nutrition (100,\
    \ 50, 50, 5 kg N,P,K,Zn /kg ha-1 ) + biochar application / residue mulching +\
    \ PGPR seed treatment appeared potential varieties, crop establishment and nutrient\
    \ management options for better drought management, stable and higher yield under\
    \ rainfed upland condition. Direct seeding of Sub1 rice varieties (Swarna Sub-1/Sambha\
    \ Sub-1) either alone or with Sesbania co-culture and surface seeding of linseed\
    \ or wheat before rice harvest had prooved a stable and profitable option for\
    \ rained lowlands/flood-prone ecosystem . CA based practices involving climate\
    \ smart crop & resource management options and stress tolerant rice varieties\
    \ appropriate to the situation would be helpful for better resource use efficiency,\
    \ soil health and climate resilience."
