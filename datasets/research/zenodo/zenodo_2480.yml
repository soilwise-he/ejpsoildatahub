  title: How binomial (traditional rainfed olive grove-Crocus sativus) crops impact
    the soil bacterial community and enhance microbial capacities
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Intercropping can favour the yield of the main crop. However,
    because of the potential competition among woody crops, this system is rarely
    used by farmers. To increase knowledge about the intercropping system, we have
    explored three different combinations of alley cropping in rainfed olive groves
    compared to conventional management (CP): (i) &lt;em&gt;Crocus sativus&lt;/em&gt;
    (D-S); (ii) &lt;em&gt;Vicia sativa&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Avena sativa&lt;/em&gt;
    in annual rotation (D-O); and (iii) &lt;em&gt;Lavandula x intermedia &lt;/em&gt;(D-L).
    Different soil chemical properties were analyzed to evaluate the effects of alley
    cropping, while 16S rRNA amplification and enzymatic activities were determined
    to study the changes that occurred in soil microbial communities and activity.
    In addition, the influence of intercropping on the potential functionality of
    the soil microbial community was measured.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Data revealed that the intercropping systems highly affected the microbial
    community and soil properties. The D-S cropping system increased soil total organic
    carbon and total nitrogen that were correlated with the bacterial community, indicating
    that both parameters were the main drivers shaping the structure of the bacterial
    community. The D-S soil cropping system had significantly higher relative abundances
    of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Patescibacteria compared to the
    other systems and the genera &lt;em&gt;Adhaeribacter&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Arthrobacter&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;
    Rubellimicrobium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ramlibacter&lt;/em&gt;, related to
    C and N functions. D-S soil was also related to the highest relative abundances
    of &lt;em&gt;Pseudoarthrobacter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Haliangium&lt;/em&gt;,
    associated with the plant growth&ndash;promoting effect, antifungal activity,
    and a potential P solubilizer. A &nbsp;potentially increase of C fixation and
    N fixation in soils was also observed in the D-S cropping system. These positive
    changes were related to the cessation of tillage and the development of a spontaneous
    cover crop, which increased soil protection. Thus, management practices that contribute
    to increasing soil cover should be encouraged to improve soil functionality.&lt;/p&gt;'
