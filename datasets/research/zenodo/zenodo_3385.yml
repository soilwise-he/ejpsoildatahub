  title: Improvement of Sub Grade Soil Using Nylon Fibers
  abstract: 'Rapid population growth, increasing user demand of land for living, transportation,
    industry<br>

    Initialization, educational institution and various types of power stations built
    on the sub-soil.<br>

    For the construction of new infrastructures it is important to have a high strength
    (quality) of<br>

    Soil and along with the possible effect of cost-effective and also fully save
    the environment.<br>

    Nowadays, it is the major challenge for civil engineer to improve sub grade soil
    for<br>

    construction work. Recent illustration about construction of highway or roadway
    is weak sub<br>

    grade soil. Soil reinforcement is the method associated with the increase of strength
    and<br>

    decreases the deformation properties of soil. This paper discussed regarding the
    effects of<br>

    fiber on the CBR value of a clay soil reinforced with Nylon fibers. A series of
    CBR tests were<br>

    conducted on samples of unreinforced and reinforced clay with different percentages
    of<br>

    randomly distributed nylon fibers. The soil samples were prepared by its Maximum
    Dry<br>

    Density (MDD) and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) as well as in this study, different<br>

    percentage of fibers by dry weight of soil is used. The CBR values have been founded
    from<br>

    present investigation are 3.55, 4.57, 7.70, and 7.83 by using 0.0%, 0.25%, 0.5%
    and 0.75%<br>

    of Nylon fibers respectively for 30 mm length. Correspondingly, the CBR values
    have been<br>

    founded from present investigation are 3.55, 5.31, 8.20 and 9.22 by using 0.0%,
    0.25%, 0.5%<br>

    and 0.75% of Nylon fibers respectively for 60 mm length. Also, the diameter of
    the nylon fiber<br>

    was constant at 1 mm. This investigation exemplify that the CBR value increased
    significantly<br>

    with the percentages and length of the nylon fibers. For the greater value of
    CBR thickness of<br>

    the pavement will reduce.'
