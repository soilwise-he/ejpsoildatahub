  title: Influence Of Local Soil Conditions On Optimal Load Factors For Seismic Design
    Of Buildings
  abstract: Optimal load factors (dead, live and seismic) used for the design of buildings
    may be different, depending of the seismic ground motion characteristics to which
    they are subjected, which are closely related to the type of soil conditions where
    the structures are located. The influence of the type of soil on those load factors,
    is analyzed in the present study. A methodology that is useful for establishing
    optimal load factors that minimize the cost over the life cycle of the structure
    is employed; and as a restriction, it is established that the probability of structural
    failure must be less than or equal to a prescribed value. The life-cycle cost
    model used here includes different types of costs. The optimization methodology
    is applied to two groups of reinforced concrete buildings. One set (consisting
    on 4-, 7-, and 10-story buildings) is located on firm ground (with a dominant
    period Ts=0.5 s) and the other (consisting on 6-, 12-, and 16-story buildings)
    on soft soil (Ts=1.5 s) of Mexico City. Each group of buildings is designed using
    different combinations of load factors. The statistics of the maximums inter-story
    drifts (associated with the structural capacity) are found by means of incremental
    dynamic analyses. The buildings located on firm zone are analyzed under the action
    of 10 strong seismic records, and those on soft zone, under 13 strong ground motions.
    All the motions correspond to seismic subduction events with magnitudes M=6.9.
    Then, the structural damage and the expected total costs, corresponding to each
    group of buildings, are estimated. It is concluded that the optimal load factors
    combination is different for the design of buildings located on firm ground than
    that for buildings located on soft soil.
