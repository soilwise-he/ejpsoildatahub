  title: An approximating mathematical model of interaction between a freely rotating
    disk and soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A generalized mathematical model of disk interaction with soil
    was built under general assumptions regarding the mode of the disk knife motion
    in soil, namely, in a mode of slippage, skidding or rolling without slippage and
    skidding. Previously constructed models follow from it as particular cases at
    certain values of parameters. However, because of computational complexity of
    this model for the case of a freely rotating disk knife consisting in the need
    for a preliminary numerical solution of a transcendental equation to determine
    the mode of disk motion, the generalized mathematical model has not found wide
    application. Therefore, an analytical two-dimensional approximation of a generalized
    model of disk interaction with soil which is a new model of approximation type
    was constructed on the basis of a computer experiment using the least squares
    method.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;An explicit expression was obtained for the kinematic parameter of a
    freely rotating disk knife which determines its mode of motion. It was established
    that this parameter is a rational function of relative depth of the disk penetration
    and the dimensionless dynamic coefficient characterizing soil properties. Also,
    explicit expressions were obtained for the projections of the resultant soil reaction
    forces acting on the blade of the disk knife and its side faces depending on the
    data of dimensionless parameters. It has been established that the horizontal
    component of the reaction which determines tractive resistance of the disk is
    also a rational function of the relative penetration depth and the dimensionless
    dynamic coefficient. It was established that the magnitude of the kinematic parameter
    significantly affects the magnitude and direction of the resultant soil reactions
    to the disk. The expressions obtained make it possible to significantly simplify
    experiments to determine the resultant soil reaction forces to a freely rotating
    disk knife and reduce their required number. These expressions make it possible
    to carry out strength calculations of soil-cultivating working tools with disks
    and determine their optimal parameters according to the strength criteria and
    the minimum specific energy consumption with accuracy sufficient for engineering
    practice. Adequacy of the obtained expressions was confirmed by comparison with
    experimental data of the disk knife dynamometry&lt;/p&gt;'
