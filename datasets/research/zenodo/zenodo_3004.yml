  title: Physiological And Biochemical Responses Of Two Cultivars Of Phaseolus Vulgaris
    L. To Application Of Organic Fertilizers And Nile Compost In Sandy Soil
  abstract: 'Aims: The present work aims to stimulate some physiological changes in
    the plants using organic fertilizer and compost by enhancing some compounds such
    as total amino acids and phytohormones in two cultivars of bean. Study Design:
    The pots of the (Phaseolus vulgaris) L. cv. bronco were divided into 7 subgroups
    they will be prepared as in the seven treatments via1- control , Nile compost
    ,compost and rice straw , compost and maize stalks , rice straw and maize stalks
    , rice straw , maize stalks and were replicate times for Phaseolus vulgaris L.
    cv. paulista from T8-T14. After 45 days (vegetative stage), 90 days for (flowering
    stage) and 130 days for (fruiting stage) the plants were harvested. Place and
    Duration of Study: Department of Biological and Geological Science, Faculty of
    Education, Ain Shams University, Cairo-Egypt June 2012. Methodology: Growth, yield,
    free amino acids and phytohormones of two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv.
    paulista and cv. bronco was investigated. Results: The results showed that the
    significant differences in growth in all the stages and percent of free amino
    acids and phytohormones in shoot in vegetative stage in two cultivars of bean
    were obtained with mixture of compost or maize stalk and maize stalk decompost.
    Conclusion: Generally, the addition of organic fertilizer with compost led to
    improve the yield of two cultivars as compared to control. Hence, it could be
    suggested that the treated plants, with these organic residues and Nile compost
    increased the growth, yield and the above chemical compositions.'
