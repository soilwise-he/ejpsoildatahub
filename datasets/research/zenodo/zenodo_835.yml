  title: The Effect Of Compacted Fill Layers On Soil Bearing Capacity
  abstract: In this paper, plate load test was used to study the effect of compacted
    fill layers on bearing capacity. The test was developed using selected soil from
    HATTAB source. The soil was classified as low plastic soil, silty or clayey gravel
    with CBR 16% filled in trench foundation. Plate load test was carried out on each
    layer. Sand cone test also was done for each layer to determine the field density
    value. The analysis of results obtained from the experimental program showed that,
    settlement of layer decreases as the number of layers increased. The bearing capacity
    of layers increased as the number of layers increased; this situation is valid
    for certain thickness after which no considerable effect was recorded.
