  title: Enhanceing the Properties of Soil by using Synthetic Polypropylene
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is the cheapest and easily available building material,
    but it is poor in mechanical properties such as bearing strength of soil. Research
    workers are continuously trying to improve the mechanical properties of soil,
    reinforced earth is a construction material having soil fill, toughen by addition
    of rods, bars, fibers, or nets that make a bond with the soil by mode of frictional
    resistance and act as a clear mass. It is used in many applications retaining
    structures, embankments etc. On comparing soil properties by adding different
    percentage of fibres by soil&#39;s dry weight by performing direct shear test
    and standard procter test different properties are carried out. As we add polypropylene
    fiber in the soil maximum dry density decreases and there is the increase in optimum
    moisture content direct shear test that performed on soil shows the decrement
    in the value of internal friction and increase in the value of cohesion. Increase
    in Unconfined compression strength Amjed Ali Khan | Er Anu &quot;Enhanceing the
