  title: Mapping Soil Properties with Fixed Rank Kriging of Proximally Sensed Soil
    Data Fused with Sentinel-2 Biophysical Parameter
  abstract: Soil surveys with line-scanning platforms appear to have great advantages
    over the traditional methods used to collect soil information for the development
    of field-scale soil mapping and applications. These carry VNIR (visible and near
    infrared) spectrometers and have been used in recent years extensively for the
    assessment of soil fertility at the field scale, and the delineation of site-specific
    management zones (MZ). A challenging feature of VNIR applications in precision
    agriculture (PA) is the massiveness of the derived datasets that contain point
    predictions of soil properties, and the interpolation techniques involved in incorporating
    these data into site-specific management plans. In this study, fixed-rank kriging
    (FRK) geostatistical interpolation, which is a flexible, non-stationary spatial
    interpolation method especially suited to handling huge datasets, was applied
    to massive VNIR soil scanner data for the production of useful, smooth interpolated
    maps, appropriate for the delineation of site-specific MZ maps. Moreover, auxiliary
    Sentinel-2 databased biophysical parameters NDVI (normalized difference vegetation
    index) and fAPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by
    the canopy) were included as covariates to improve the filtering performance of
    the interpolator and the ability to generate uniform patterns of spatial variation
    from which it is easier to receive a meaningful interpretation in PA applications.
    Results from the VNIR prediction dataset obtained from a pivot-irrigated field
    in Albacete, southeastern Spain, during 2019, have shown that FRK variants outperform
    ordinary kriging in terms of filtering capacity, by doubling the noise removal
    metrics while keeping the computation cost reasonably low. Such features, along
    with the capacity to handle a large volume of spatial information, nominate the
    method as ideal for PA applications with massive proximal and remote sensing datasets.
