  title: Effects of Gypsum, Farmyard Manure, and N on Ameliorating Highly Sodic Soil
    and on Yields of Rice and Wheat
  abstract: This article 'Effects of Gypsum, Farmyard Manure, and N on Ameliorating
    Highly Sodic Soil and on Yields of Rice and Wheat' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development
    of improved technology for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism
    to help scientists keep each other informed of current rice research findings.
    The concise scientific notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate
    with one another to obtain details on the research reported.
