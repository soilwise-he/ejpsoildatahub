  title: Characterisation of Roman copper alloy artefacts and soil from Rakafot 54
    (Beer Sheva, Israel)
  abstract: The research presented in this paper focused on the preliminary non-destructive
    analysis of copper alloys, corrosion, and soil components from a Roman archaeological
    site in Israel. pXRF, XRD, and micromorphological analyses were carried out to
    gain a better understanding of the corrosion processes affecting the copper alloy
    artefacts, by characterising the alloy composition, soil environments, and corrosion
    products. Preliminary results indicate that the artefacts consist of copper-lead-tin
    alloys, covered by copper hydroxy-chlorides and lead sulphate phases with slight
    variations in their crystallisation. The multianalytical approach revealed the
    presence of quartz, calcite, gypsum and feldspars in the sediments, while thin
    sections more specifically indicate loess soils with local micro-environments.
