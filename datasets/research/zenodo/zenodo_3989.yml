  title: Investigation of Effective Parameters on Pullout Capacity in Soil Nailing
    with Special Attention to International Design Codes
  abstract: An important and influential factor in design and determining the safety
    factor in Soil Nailing is the ultimate pullout capacity, or, in other words, bond
    strength. This important parameter depends on several factors such as material
    and soil texture, method of implementation, excavation diameter, friction angle
    between the nail and the soil, grouting pressure, the nail depth (overburden pressure),
    the angle of drilling and the degree of saturation in soil. Federal Highway Administration
    (FHWA), a customary regulation in the design of nailing, is considered only the
    effect of the soil type (or rock) and the method of implementation in determining
    the bond strength, which results in non-economic design. The other regulations
    are each of a kind, some of the parameters affecting bond resistance are not taken
    into account. Therefore, in the present paper, at first the relationships and
    tables presented by several valid regulations are presented for estimating the
    ultimate pullout capacity, and then the effect of several important factors affecting
    on ultimate Pullout capacity are studied. Finally, it was determined, the effect
    of overburden pressure (in method of injection with pressure), soil dilatation
    and roughness of the drilling surface on pullout strength is incremental, and
    effect of degree of soil saturation on pullout strength to a certain degree of
    saturation is increasing and then decreasing. therefore it is better to get help
    from nail pullout-strength test results and numerical modeling to evaluate the
    effect of parameters such as overburden pressure, dilatation, and degree of soil
    saturation, and so on to reach an optimal and economical design.
