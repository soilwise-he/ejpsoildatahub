  title: Experimental Study of Black Cotton Soil and Clay soil with Bagasse Ash and
    Tyre Cord for Stabilization of Soil
  abstract: <em>In this investigation, clay soil from Chandigarh, India, was gathered
    and stabilised using crushed rubber tyres. The size of the shredded rubber tyres
    ranges from 30mm to 50mm in length and 15mm to 25mm in width.The proportions of
    shredded rubber tyres added to stabilise clay soil (4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) were
    changed. The California bearing ratio test was performed once the samples were
    prepared. According to the test results, the ideal amount of rubber tyre shreds
    is 8% of size 25mm x 50mm in dry conditions, and the CBR value is 66.28%. studied
    the use of used rubber tyres for soil stabilisation in order to dispose of them
    and protect the earth's ecosystem and atmosphere. The strength, bearing capacity,
    and cost-effectiveness of the rubber tyre are all benefited by its favourable
    physical and chemical characteristics. Rubber tyre scraps of various sizes were
    prepared and added at weights of 4.5, 9, 13.5, and 18% to the clay soil. The unconfined
    compressive test was performed once the samples were prepared. The test findings
    revealed that the soil treated with 18% tyre scrap had the greatest UCS value,
    which was 1.75 kg/cm2.</em>
