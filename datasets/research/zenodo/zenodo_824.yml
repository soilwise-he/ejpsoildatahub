  title: ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF SOIL HYDROCARBON POLLUTION BY MEASURING MAGNETIC
    SUSCEPTIBILITY
  abstract: "In this work, the magnetic susceptibility (\uF063) of soils in situ was\
    \ measured on the Pirallahi Island Oil Area. Pirallahi Island Oil Area is located\
    \ near the Absheron Peninsula of Azerbaijan (Fig.1). In order to compare the results\
    \ of measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of hydrocarbon (HC) -contaminated\
    \ soils in situ, the ones of the HC of the hydrocarbon-free Dubendi site located\
    \ on the mainland were also carried out. As a result of comparison of \u03C7 measurements,\
    \ a difference in readings was revealed in both areas. Thus, the influence of\
    \ hydrocarbons on the change in magnetic susceptibility measured on two similar\
    \ areas is obvious. This clearly indicates a change in the association of magnetic\
    \ minerals in soils exposed to hydrocarbons. It follows from the above that, using\
    \ measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of soils in situ, we can detect\
    \ areas contaminated with hydrocarbons. In the future, when using magnetic susceptibility\
    \ and other magnetic parameters measured in bottom sedimentary rocks, they can\
    \ be used as a new search feature for oil and gas deposits."
