  title: Empirical Model Approach For The Evaluation Of Ph And Conductivity On Pollutant
    Diffusion In Soil Environment
  abstract: This work is aimed at developing a mathematical model equation that can
    be used to predict the fate of contaminant in the soil environment. The mathematical
    model was developed based on the fundamental laws of conservation and the equation
    of continuity given asand was resolved to obtain a quadratic equation of the form
    C(X) = DX2+vX+f. The developed equation was then used to fit the experimental
    data that were obtained from the Physio-chemical analysis of the soil samples
    which were obtained at various depths; within the vicinity of the H &amp; H Asphalt
    plant Company, located at Enito 3 in Ahoada West L.G.A, River State, Nigeria.
    The Experimental and Model results obtained from the Calculation and Simulation
    of the developed models were compared numerically and graphically as presented
    in this work. It was observed that there is reasonable level of agreement between
    the three results. The polynomial of the curve was established to ascertain the
    validity of the model; this was done for all the parameters that were analyzed.
    From the findings the model developed can be used to predict the concentration
    of a chemical pollutant at various depths. The reliability of the model developed
    was established giving the fact that through this quadratic equation the diffusivity
    (coefficient of diffusion), the water velocity and the irreversible reaction decay
    rate could be determined.
