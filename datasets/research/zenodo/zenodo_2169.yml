  title: Characterization of soil health and nutrient content status across the North-East
    Maasai Landscape, Arusha Tanzania
  abstract: '&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Soil fertility management has been a great challenge to smallholder farmers
    in the Northern Tanzania, especially in the Maasai landscape. Therefore understanding
    the nutrient status become important to forecast productivity, promote sustainability,
    and propose an appropriate technique for crop productivity sustainability. The
    study examines soil fertility status of the Maasai landscape. Systematic approach
    known as the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) were used to identify
    soil sampling points. A total of 604 soil samples from two soil depth (0 &ndash;
    30 and 30 &ndash; 50 cm) were collected for physiochemical properties analysis
    using Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. This study found that, there is a significance
    difference on soil fertility status across the landscape. Major soil nutrient
    fertility constraints found were N, P, Ca, and K for some soils. The study recommends
    that interventions to address the issue of soil fertility in the northeast Maasai
    landscape should consider the altitude issue due to variations in soil health
    and nutrient content.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
