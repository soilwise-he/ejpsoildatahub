  title: 'Impact and vibratory driven pipe piles: the difference in soil stresses
    and bearing capacities due to the installation method'
  abstract: The influence of the installation of open-ended pipe piles on soil stresses
    is studied by means of scale model tests in<br> sand. Variants with different
    pile diameters, soil densities and installation methods are investigated. Measurements
    of<br> pile dynamics and soil stresses are carried out as a basis for further
    analysis. During impact pile driving, the radial soil<br> stresses acting on the
    pile wall increases to a peak value as the pile tip approaches a soil element
    and decrease to a<br> residual value afterwards ('friction fatigue'). The peak
    value of soil stresses increases with soil density. The residual<br> value was
    found to be close to the earth pressure at rest. In case of vibratory pile installation,
    soil stress developments<br> range from 'very similar to impact pile driving'
    to 'no effect', depending on vibratory driving parameters. High soil<br> stress
    changes due to vibro-driving correlate with high permanent displacements per vibration
    cycle. Both peak and<br> residual radial soil stresses need to be considered for
    pile driving simulations, as they are the basis for the pile shaft<br> friction.
    A novel formulation for the 'friction fatigue' phenomenon during impact pile driving
    is presented. In contrast<br> to current practice, the authors suggest using different
    approaches to calculate the peak skin friction for impact and<br> vibratory driven
    piles. The soil stress at the end of driving is a key driver for the pile's load
    bearing behaviour. As<br> increased soil stresses may remain after pile installation,
    especially near the pile tip, different soil stress developments<br> have implications
    for the axial or lateral pile design.
