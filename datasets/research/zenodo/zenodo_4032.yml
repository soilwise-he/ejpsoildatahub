  title: Enhancing the Productivity of Degraded Land Through Soil and Water Conservation
    Technique in Carita Research Forest, West Java
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Encroachments on Carita Research Forest area have exacerbated
    the degradation of land due to uncontrolled runoff, erosion and nutrient losses
    especially on the sloping land with high annual rainfall. To reduce the severity
    of the degradation the area should be rehabilitated by applying soil and water
    conservation techniques. The techniques used were the vegetative methods (culture),
    and a combination of it with mechanical/technical methods. The combination method
    is expected to be more effective in controlling runoff, erosion and nutrient losses.
    One important parameter is the efficiency of the distance of the vertical mulch
    channel, which affects the application cost. This study was aimed to determine
    the effect of different distances of vertical mulch channels on the plant growth
    and annual crop yield as well as its effectiveness in controlling runoff, erosion
    and nutrient losses. The research was conducted in Carita Research Forest from
    2005 to 2008, using the randomized block design. Treatments applied were: vertical
    mulch with six and twelve meter distances of plots of khaya (Khaya anthotheca
    C.Dc.) and corn ( Zea mays L.) cropping system. Observations included height and
    diameter growth of khaya, runoff and erosion, and cost per ha. The results showed
    that six meter of vertical mulch was the most efficient distance. The height and
    diameter of khaya tree increased by 7% and 31% in six meter distance compared
    to the control. Moreover, runoff and erosion was reduced by 75% and 37%, and nutrient
    losses could be trimmed down by three to five times. In addition, six meters distance
    could also produce corn of 712 kg/ha/year, which was 73% greater than corn production
    without vertical mulch. On the other hand, the cropping system with six meter
    distance of vertical mulch required Rp 3,250,000,- per ha, which was Rp 250,000,-
    more expensive than that without vertical mulch.&lt;/p&gt;'
