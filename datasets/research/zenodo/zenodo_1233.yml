  title: Soil catenas and plant sites on the northern macroslope of Rila Mountain
  abstract: "The following paper represents results from a research focused on the\
    \ soil associations and their corresponding vegetation communities (soil-plant\
    \ catenas), located on the northern slopes (N, NW, NE) of the Rila Mountains.\
    \ Data from eight key sites located between 815 and 2041 m above sea level is\
    \ discussed. The slope in each site varies from 2\xB0 to 25\xB0, and most often\
    \ the tests and descriptions were carried out on sites with a slope of 10-15\xB0\
    . Vegetation cover is analyzed with plant community plots which provides data\
    \ on species composition, abundance and coverage. The size of each plot varies\
    \ from 16 up to 225 m2 depending on the vegetation type. Topsoil horizons were\
    \ tested in each site in order to diagnose the subspecies diversity of brown forest\
    \ soils (Cambisols) using ratio of humic acids to fulvic acids. That ratio varies\
    \ from 0,69 up to 1,61 in all studied sites. Both acids are associated with the\
    \ dominance of different vegetation types \u2013 deciduous, mixed or coniferous\
    \ forest or herbaceous canopy. The results are interrupted in terms of the diagnosis\
    \ and classification of Cambisols and Umbrosols in the area of interest. Differences\
    \ in soil and vegetation cover of Northwest and Eastern Rila Mountain are highlighted\
    \ and analyzed."
