  title: Changes in Biomass Accumulation and Soil Properties After Fertilization of
    Ryegrass
  abstract: "A containers experiment was carried out in four variants with fertilization\
    \ of ryegrass: 1th and 2nd trials, with the addition of 1ml and 5ml of organic\
    \ fertilizer \u201CSiapton\u201D and 3th and 4th trials: a combination of Siapton\
    \ (0.5 ml fertilizer in 50 ml of water ) with the mineral fertilizer \"Kristalon\"\
    \ in quantity of 0.5 and 2 grams respectively. There was used also a control.\
    \ It is accounted a higher accumulation of organic matter (content of C% and N%)\
    \ in leaves of ryegrass after fertilizing in comparison with the control. Accumulation\
    \ of dry matter also is higher in fertilized variants (27.09 \xF7 37.62) compared\
    \ to the control (25.99g). This difference is not confirmed and does not recorded\
    \ in relation to the roots of ryegrass. Acidification of soils is changed towards\
    \ a higher pH (5.5 \xF7 6.4) in fertilized variants in comparison with the control\
    \ (pH = 5.2). The humus composition was studied by the method of Kononova - Belchikova,\
    \ but apparent differences were not accounted in relation to the use of organic\
    \ and mineral fertilizers. The content of humic acids extracted with pyrophosphate\
    \ calculated according the weight of soil samples is lowest in control (1.02%),\
    \ where the content of fulvic acids is high (0.40%)."
