  title: Application of green bioremediation technology for soil, water and air remediation
  abstract: <strong>Abstract:</strong> Pollution, a serious environmental problem
    has been attaining the considerable public<br> awareness over the last decades.
    Contaminated water streams and landfills represent a<br> technical challenge.
    New and green technologies are needed to remove innumerable waste<br> especially
    those which are toxic. Bioremediation is an green technology which is widely<br>
    used to reduce the toxic pollutants from the environment, with this technology
    utilization of<br> plants and other biological entities (microbes and enzymes)
    to cleanup pollutants (metal and<br> organic) from the environment is done which
    is not only offering eco-friendly approach but<br> are also cost effective. Waste
    generation is one of the most visible and biggest problems that<br> affect virtually
    all environments. As per the World Bank data, waste generation levels are<br>
    approximately 1.3 billion tons per year, and are expected to increase to approximately
    2.2<br> billion tons per year by 2025. Modern lifestyle is responsible for increasing
    a waste<br> generation; the data represents a significant increase in per capita
    waste generation rates,<br> from 1.2 to 1.42 kg per person per day in the next
    fifteen years. Thus, the situation requires<br> urgent plans and strategies for
    the management of waste and associated complications.<br> Bioremediation is a
    green approach to reduce the enormous waste and reduce pollutants<br> which harm
    the environment; therefore, bioremediation is an irreplaceable weapon for vast<br>
    application in the monarchy of environmental protection.
