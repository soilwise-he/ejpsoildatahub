  title: 'Deterioration of Soil Health Due to Stubble Burning: Solution to its Root
    Cause'
  abstract: "Stubble burning has a great impact on environment, health of soil. The\
    \ most often burned material is sugarcane leaves, followed by wheat and paddy.\
    \ One centimeter of soil is heated by burning paddy straw, raising the soil's\
    \ temperature to 33.8 to 42.2\xB0C. According to reports, the fire steadily reduced\
    \ soil biological activity and organic matter by eradicating the bacterial and\
    \ fungal populations necessary for a fruitful soil. Carbon in the ash cannot exist\
    \ as a food source for the micro-organisms and acts only as a support for them.\
    \ Thus, the activity of micro-organisms and their population declines which results\
    \ in disruption of various biological processes in the soil."
