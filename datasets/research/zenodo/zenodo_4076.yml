  title: Quantitative Assessment Of Potential Soil Erosion In The Eastern Siberia
    Region (Using The Example Of The Markha River Basin)
  abstract: '<em>The paper presents the results of estimations of potential soil erosion
    in the basins of the small rivers of the Markha River watershed (the Lena River
    basin), using geoinformation technologies. The creation of specialized geoinformation
    database and GIS for the basins of small rivers of the Arctic watershed of the
    Asian part of Russia is considered in detail, in the scale 1: 1,000,000, adopted
    for the research, corresponding to the regional level of spatial detail. The source
    materials for filling the geodatabase were the following: digital model of relief
    (the unit of regular raster grid was 250*250 m), maps of climatic parameters,
    maps of land cover properties, maps of landscape structure, and types of land
    use. The prototype of created geodatabase was used for estimation of potential
    soil losses on the test site, in the conditions of a flat relief - in the Markha
    River basin. Calculations were carried out, using the mathematical formula, recommended
    by the Scientific-Research Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Channel Processes of
    the Moscow State University n.a. M.V. Lomonosov. This model provides for the calculations
    of soil losses by the following categories: soil losses from snowmelt runoff,
    soil losses from storm runoff, potential total soil losses. The maximum possible
    values of the potential soil losses were obtained. The next stage of calculations
    provided for additional calibration of input parameters, in particular, consideration
    of the types of land cover. The results of calculations were approximate to the
    actual values of soil losses. In order to verify the values of soil losses in
    the Markha River basin, the values of                runoff of suspended sediments
    were used. The obtained values are quite similar and comparable. The information
    is new.</em>
