  title: Comparative Analysis Of Soil Enzyme Activities Between Laurel-Leaved And
    Cryptomeria Japonica Forests
  abstract: "Soil enzyme activities in Kasuga-yama Hill Primeval Forest (Nara, Japan)\
    \ were examined to determine levels of mineralization and metabolism. Samples\
    \ were selected from the soil surrounding laurel-leaved (B<sub>B-1</sub>) and\
    \ <em>C</em><em>arpinus</em><em> japonica</em> (B<sub>B-2</sub> and P<sub>w</sub>)\
    \ trees for analysis. Cellulase, \u03B2-xylosidase, and protease activities were\
    \ higher in B<sub>B-1</sub> samples those in B<sub>B-2 </sub>samples. These activity\
    \ levels corresponded to the distribution of cellulose and hemicellulose in the\
    \ soil horizons. Cellulase, \u03B2-xylosidase, and chymotrypsin activities were\
    \ higher in soil from the P<sub>w</sub> forest than in that from the B<sub>B-2\
    \ </sub>forest. The relationships between the soil enzymes calculated by Spearman\u2019\
    s rank correlation indicate that the interactions between enzymes in B<sub>B-2</sub>\
    \ samples were more complex than those in P<sub>w</sub> samples."
