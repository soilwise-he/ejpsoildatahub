  title: Effects of fire disturbance on alpha and beta diversity and on beta diversity
    components of soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation
  abstract: "&lt;b&gt;Background and aims&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Although an understanding\
    \ of the effects of fire severity on diversity components of the soil seed bank\
    \ (SSB) and aboveground vegetation (AGV) is important to inform conservation and\
    \ restoration practices of biodiversity, the effects of fire severity on \u03B1\
    - and \u03B2-diversity of SSB and AGV are poorly understood. While \u03B2-diversity\
    \ is shaped by spatial turnover and nestedness, research on the effects of fire\
    \ severity on these components of \u03B2-diversity is limited. We aimed to determine\
    \ the effects of low and high fire severity on species richness and \u03B1- (within\
    \ sample) and \u03B2- (among sample) diversity components on the relationship\
    \ between the SSB and AGV. Since turnover and nestedness are components of \u03B2\
    -diversity, we assessed their patterns of change after dif ferent fire intensities\
    \ in the SSB and AGV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Soil seed bank\
    \ samples were collected from the same 180 sample points used for measurement\
    \ of AGV in semi-arid &lt;i&gt; Quercus persica&lt;/i&gt; woodlands. Additive\
    \ partitioning diversity was used to divide total diversi ty into \u03B1-and \u03B2\
    -diversity of the SSB and the AGV. Total \u03B2-diversity of the SSB and AGV was\
    \ additively partitioned into spatial turnover and nestedness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key\
    \ results&lt;/b&gt; \u2013 Fire severity had significant effects on \u03B1- and\
    \ \u03B2-diversity of both the SSB and AGV. The highest and lowest richness and\
    \ \u03B1- and \u03B2-diversity in both the SSB and AGV were found in low and high\
    \ severity fire sites, respectively. Partitioning \u03B2-diversity of the SSB\
    \ and the AGV into turnover and nestedness components revealed that spatial turnover\
    \ was the main contributor to \u03B2-diversity. High fire severity significantly\
    \ increased similarity between SSB and AGV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;\
    \ \u2013 Low, but not high, severity fire can increase species diversity in the\
    \ AGV and SSB, and it has the potential to serve as a tool for management and\
    \ restoration of semi-arid Mediterranean regions, thereby enhancing plant diversity\
    \ and structural heterogeneity. However, high severity fire may lead to loss of\
    \ many species in both the SSB and the AGV resulting in loss of biodiversity."
