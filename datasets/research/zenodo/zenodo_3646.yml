  title: Balancing Out of Black Cotton Soil Using Polypropylene Fiber and Stone Powder
  abstract: Black cotton soil is spread all over the entire area in Maharashtra and
    some parts of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Black cotton
    soil have the characteristic to swelling or shrinking with the change in moisture
    content which affect the pavement base course and structural elements. For stabilizing
    expansive soil the UCS, SPT, CBR tests are carried out with the addition of Stone
    Powder (8% and 16%) and Polypropylene fibers (0.8%, 1.6% and 2.4%). Tests are
    carried out for determining the compressive strength of soil is increasing with
    the increasing in admixtures.
