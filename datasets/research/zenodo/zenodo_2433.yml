  title: Soil-litter macrofauna in the mixed forest and midfield shelterbelts of different
    age (Turew area, West Poland)
  abstract: 'The paper deals with the composition, density and biomass of soil-litter
    macrofauna in four midfield shelterbelts of different age and, comparatively,
    in the neighbouring mixed forest. The increase was observed along with the shelterbelt
    ageing of: 1) numbers of all macrofauna and particularly of some taxa (Symphyla,
    Chilopoda, coleopteran larvae and imagines and some dipteran larvae), 2) biomass
    of all macrofauna, of soil fauna (Group I) and of coleopteran larvae, 3) share
    of zoophages in all macrofauna and in dipteran larvae, 4) share of phytophages
    in coleopteran larvae communities, 5) average individual biomass, 6) taxonomic
    richness and the biodiversity (H''), 7) similarity of composition and domination
    structure of all macrofauna and of dipteran larvae to those in forest communities.
    The decrease of density of dipteran larvae, particularly of Chironomidae and Sciaridae
    and the share of saprophages in all macrofauna and in dipteran larvae was also
    observed. Successional stages of more numerous invertebrate taxa in newly established
    woodlots are described. Dipteran larvae were the pioneers in colonising newly
    established shelterbelts, particularly larvae from two families: Chironomidae
    and Sciaridae. Their combined contribution to the total density of dipteran larvae
    was 92%.'
