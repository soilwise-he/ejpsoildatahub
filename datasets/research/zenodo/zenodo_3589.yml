  title: Determination Of The Specific Activity Of Soil And Fertilizers In Sergipe
    - Brazil
  abstract: "Measurements of radioactivity in the environment is of great importance\
    \ to monitor and control the levels of radiation to which man is exposed directly\
    \ or indirectly. It is necessary to show that regardless of working or being close\
    \ to nuclear power plants, people are daily in contact with some amount of radiation\
    \ from the actual environment and food that are ingested, contradicting the view\
    \ of most of them. The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of natural and\
    \ artificial radiation from radionuclides present in cement, soil and fertilizers\
    \ used in Sergipe State \u2013 Brazil. The radionuclide activitiesmeasured all\
    \ samples arebelow the Brazilian limit of the exclusion and exemption criteria\
    \ from the requirement of radiation protection.It was detected Be-7 in organic\
    \ fertilizers that means a short interval between the brewing processes for use\
    \ in agriculture. It was also detected an unexpected Cs-137 in some samples; however\
    \ its activities does not represent risk for the population. Th-231 was also found\
    \ in samples of soil and cement in the state of Sergipe that is an unprecedented\
    \ result."
