  title: ffect of Integrated Nutrient Management on performance of Rice-Wheat cropping
    system and Soil Health
  abstract: "Soil fertility and nutrient management is one of the key factors of crop\
    \ production, which directly affects the crop yield and quality.\_The rice-wheat\
    \ cropping system (RW) is the predominant cropping system of Indo-Gangatic plains\
    \ of India. After the introduction of green revolution, the yield and productivity\
    \ of rice and wheat increased tremendously with the introduction of high yielding\
    \ varieties and the adoption of improved management practices but higher application\
    \ rates of inputs to meet the food demands of increasing population led to the\
    \ serious problem of depletion of soil health which is further causing a threat\
    \ to the sustainability of RW cropping system. The major causes of the decline\
    \ in productivity of continuous RW cropping system are inherently low fertility\
    \ status, appearance of multiple nutrient deficiencies, and imbalanced use of\
    \ synthetic fertilizers, groundwater depletion, soil salinisation and inadequate\
    \ system diversity. So, improvement in soil health and quality for sustained agricultural\
    \ production is very vital for food and nutritional security of India and it can\
    \ be possible through integrated nutrient management i.e., integrated use of synthetic\
    \ and organic manures which not only sustains the crop yield and increases the\
    \ soil fertility in long term, but also enhances the nutrient use efficiency.\
    \ Therefore, to maintain the soil sustainability and increase RW productivity\
    \ in long term, a balanced and integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizer\
    \ is the best option.\_"
