    &lt;p&gt;Landscape fragmentation typical of the Mediterranean region is the result
    of long-term settlement history and continuous socioeconomic interactions among
    countries. In complex agro-ecosystems of the Mediterranean basin, formulation
    of practical guidelines aimed at counteract soil and land degradation, water depletion,
    rural area depopulation, and the loss of agricultural knowledge is imperative.
    Based on a multidisciplinary, integrated approach, the present contribution discusses
    the role of traditional agricultural systems in ecosystem services provision,
    considering together economic sustainability and the medium-term ecological benefits.
    A permanent monitoring of rural areas specialized in traditional crop production
    such as olive and vine may support optimal selection of cultivars finely adapted
    to a warm climate. A competitive agricultural system may consider human well-being,
    social equity, and conservation of natural resources, to ensure a high level of
    services for current and future generations. Recovery and conservation of agricultural
    resources provide positive externalities and social benefits at both local and
    regional levels. Understanding the multiple use and functions of tree crop landscapes
    will contribute to improve food security, land quality, and the provision of related
    ecosystem services.&lt;/p&gt;'
