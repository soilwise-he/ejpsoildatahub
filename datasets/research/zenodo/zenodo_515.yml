  title: Indian Rockphosphates for Direct Application to the Soil
  abstract: Division of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Indian Agricultural
    Research Institute, New Delhi <em>Manuscript received 23 December 1972; accepted
    7 May 1973</em> The phosphorus fertilizer value of Laccadive and Mussoorie phosphates
    for direct application was compared with the Gafsa phosphate in a green house
    experiment. Indian rock phosphates inspite of low analysis with respect to Phosphorus
    compare fairly well with imported Gafsa rock phosphate when evaluated on the basis
    of dry matter yield and phosphorus content of pea crop.
