    \ of soil science in various research fields has increased tremendously over the\
    \ past decades. Soils are among the most fundamental elements that support life\
    \ on Earth. They provide numerous ecosystem services and document past environments\
    \ and cultural heritage. Many renowned scholars contributed to this understanding;\
    \ amongst them Roger Langohr. For more than 50 years he has been an international\
    \ authority within various fields of soil science research and as such he contributed\
    \ substantially to the improvement of interdisciplinary research strategies. His\
    \ holistic approach on understanding the book of nature through field observations\
    \ of soils has inspired researchers from far beyond the borders of Belgium. Those\
    \ who had the privilege to follow his lectures or collaborate with him have learned\
    \ that to understand soils, one has to start in the field by observing the soil\
    \ characteristics, by drawing them, and by recording their vertical and horizontal\
    \ variability. Additionally, profiles should (always) be made very deep and wide\
    \ (deeper and wider than they are often dug) to overcome local variability. One\
    \ also needs to face the complexity and be aware of the fact that the absence\
    \ of features is as important as their presence. We were also taught that soils\
    \ have to be studied on various scales, from a macro to a micro scale , passing\
    \ through mesoscale. Each soil profile can be considered as a page in the book\
    \ of the history of the larger soilscape. Thus, in order to understand the whole\
    \ story, one needs to read all the pages and chapters. With this book, we would\
    \ like to pay honour to all the scientific contribution of Roger Langohr, who\
    \ manages to fascinate, motivate and promote scientists that are active in various\
    \ research fields and come from all parts of the world. In the past few decades,\
    \ soil science has contributed greatly to discussions on climatic and environmental\
    \ changes, as well as to the understanding of various topics of human impact on\
    \ landscapes and the environment. This book aims to address these complex issues\
    \ and demonstrate how they are approached and unravelled through past and current\
    \ interdisciplinary research. The twenty-one papers composing this book address\
    \ a broad range of subjects and cover a wide geographical scope: soils and related\
    \ questions from Belgium, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, Spain, and Switzerland\
    \ are presented. These contributions testify that an interdisciplinary approach,\
    \ since long advocated by Roger Langohr, works well and proves it to be a successful\
    \ tactic. This book is the result of a participative international project that\
    \ took place between December 2018 and November 2019. Organising and meeting and\
    \ publishing a book for the day of the meeting in less than one year was only\
    \ possible thanks to the strong motivation and dedication of not only the organisers,\
    \ but also of all the contributors and reviewers. Despite the considerable extra\
    \ working load, the authors and co-authors of the papers in this book managed\
    \ to write and submit their contributions in record time. They were also asked\
    \ to assume not only the scientific and copyrights responsibility of their work,\
    \ but also the verification of content and formatting of bibliographic data included.\
    \ The 14 scientific reviewers played a crucial role in the accomplishment of this\
    \ publication. Their constructive remarks and suggestions contributed generously\
    \ to the scientific quality of the papers, while their rapid feedback and interactions\
    \ were decisive in meeting the deadline and having all the papers in the book.\
    \ This book is not only a printed document. It is also a collection of a freely\
    \ available (open access) documents. All of them have an individual digital object\
    \ identifier (doi, indicated on each paper) and are hosted by the non-commercial\
    \ depository archive (Zenodo). Moreover, the authors keep the copyright of their\
    \ contribution. The online contributions are distributed under the Creative Commons\
