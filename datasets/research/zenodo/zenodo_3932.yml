  title: Study of the Effect of Soil Compaction and Height on Pipe Ovality for Buried
    Steel Pipe
  abstract: "In this paper, the numerical study of buried steel pipe in soil is investigated.\
    \ Buried pipeline under soil weight, after embankment on the pipe leads to ovality\
    \ of pipe. In this paper also it is considered the percentage of soil compaction,\
    \ the soil height on the steel pipe and the external load of a mechanical excavator\
    \ on the steel pipe and finally, the effect of these on the rate of pipe ovality\
    \ investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the pipes\u2019 thickness on ovality\
    \ has been investigated. The results show that increasing the percentage of soil\
    \ compaction has more effect on reducing percentage of ovality, and if the percentage\
    \ of soil compaction increases, we can use the pipe with less thickness. Finally,\
    \ ovality rate of the pipe and acceptance criteria of pipe diameter up to yield\
    \ stress is investigated."
