  title: OIL EXPLOITATION AND HEAVY METALS CONTENT IN ORHOIKE KOKORI SOIL DELTA NIGERIA
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigated the heavy metals content\
    \ of Orhoike-kokori soil to ascertain the environmental health. It was an ex-post\
    \ facto research that answered 3 research questions and tested a hypothesis. To\
    \ achieve these, the study area Orhoike-Kokori was mapped out into sampling grids\
    \ (SG) and soil samples were collected from 5 spots in each sampling grid with\
    \ soil sampling auger at the depth of 15cm. The samples were bulked, composite\
    \ taken and wrapped with aluminium foil for analysis. The analytical standard\
    \ adopted was USEPA 200.7 and the instrument of determination used for detecting\
    \ the concentration of the metals was Agilent GFAAS modele 240z and 280z. The\
    \ mean results obtained were as follow: Cd, 09\xB10.10mg/kg, Cu, 38.0\xB10.21\
    \ mg/kg, Pb, 87.8\xB10.11 mg/kg, Ni, 38.3\xB10.12 mg/kg and Cr, 108.4\xB10.13\
    \ mg/kg. The mean concentrations of the heavy metals investigated were subjected\
    \ to test of significance with ANOVA using SPSS model 29 at 0.05 level of significance.\
    \ The <em>p-</em>value was 0.48 thus rejecting H<sub>0</sub>. The study concludes\
    \ that Orhoike-Kokori soil is polluted above maximum permissible limits by the\
    \ metals measured. It thus recommends that crop production should be suspended\
    \ in Orhoike-kokori soil forthwith, the impacted environment should be remediated\
    \ and the monitoring agencies NESREA and NOSDRA should increase their surveillance\
    \ and enforcement obligations. <strong>Keywords:</strong> oil exploitation, heavy\
    \ metals, soil contamination crop production, bioaccumulation, health. <strong>Title:</strong>\
