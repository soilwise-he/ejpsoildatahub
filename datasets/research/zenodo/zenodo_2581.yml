  title: Multi-Proxy Study of a Holocene Soil Profile from Romania and Its Relevance
    for Speleothem Based Paleoenvironmental Reconstructions
  abstract:
  - "&lt;p&gt;In this study, we describe a sedimentary deposit situated above Ascuns\u0103\
    \ Cave (SW Romania) that should be in depositional connection with coeval stalagmites\
    \ from the cave. We excavated a 2.5 m deep soil profile and took contiguous bulk\
    \ samples every 5 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for clay mineralogy, grain size,\
    \ chemical composition, magnetic susceptibility, and stable carbon isotopes. Radiocarbon\
    \ dating revealed that the soil is of Holocene age, and presents a depositional\
    \ hiatus between 5.4 and 2.3 thousand years before the present. Due to the open\
    \ system behavior of soils and the mobility of organic matter, a few hundred years\
    \ of uncertainty should be considered for the duration of this hiatus. The fine\
    \ fraction is dominated by silt, while the clay mineralogical association is made\
    \ of illite, chlorite, kaolinite, vermiculite, and illite&ndash;vermiculite and\
    \ illite&ndash;chlorite mixed layered minerals. The sediment source of this soil\
    \ is represented by a nearby m&eacute;lange complex, as well as by an underlying\
    \ terra rossa-type soil. As this latter type of soil is widespread in our study\
    \ area, we performed luminescence dating on two samples from a representative\
    \ location close to our site and it appears that this type of Mediterranean soil\
    \ was formed during the Last Interglacial period. &delta;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C\
    \ variability in soil organic matter and a stalagmite from the cave are compared\
    \ well, and could help future studies identify modifications in isotopic fractionation\
    \ processes within the cave.&lt;/p&gt;"
