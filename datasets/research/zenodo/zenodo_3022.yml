  title: "Nutrient use efficiency on hump &amp; hollow systems on the South Island's\
    \ West Coast \u2013 Guidelines for improved fertiliser use and soil nutrient management"
  abstract: "This guide is designed to provide for information to help in management\
    \ of fertiliser applications on hump and hollow systems on the West Coast of New\
    \ Zealand. The guide is divided into two sections. Section 1 describes how soil,\
    \ nutrient requirements and dry matter responses change as humps and hollows develop\
    \ over time, and provides guidance to manage fertiliser requirements. Section\
    \ 2 is designed to provide practical guidance on how to apply fertiliser in humps\
    \ and hollows. The guide is based on measurements of fertiliser distribution patterns\
    \ for two types of commonly used spreaders, Coombridge &amp; Alexander SAM and\
    \ Robertson\xAE Transpread, two contrasting but important fertiliser products\
    \ (urea and superphosphate), and three different widths of humps and hollows."
