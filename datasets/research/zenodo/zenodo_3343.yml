  title: Laboratory Testing Regime For Quantifying Soil Collapsibility
  abstract: "Collapsible soils go through radical rearrangement of<br>\ntheir particles\
    \ when triggered by water, stress or/and vibration,<br>\ncausing loss of volume.\
    \ This loss of volume in soil as seen in<br>\nfoundation failures has caused millions\
    \ of dollars\u2019 worth of damages<br>\nto public facilities and infrastructure\
    \ and so has an adverse effect on<br>\nthe society and people. Despite these consequences\
    \ and the several<br>\nstudies that are available, more research is still required\
    \ in the study<br>\nof soil collapsibility. Discerning the pedogenesis (formation)\
    \ of soils<br>\nand investigating the combined effects of the different geological\
    \ soil<br>\nproperties is key to elucidating and quantifying soils collapsibility.<br>\n\
    This study presents a novel laboratory testing regime that would be<br>\nundertaken\
    \ on soil samples where the effects of soil type, compactive<br>\nvariables (moisture\
    \ content, density, void ratio, degree of saturation)<br>\nand loading are analyzed.\
    \ It is anticipated that results obtained would<br>\nbe useful in mapping the\
    \ trend of the combined effect thus the basis<br>\nfor evaluating soil collapsibility\
    \ or collapse potentials encountered in<br>\nconstruction with volume loss problems\
    \ attributed to collapse."
