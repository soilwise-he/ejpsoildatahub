  title: Trends in soil mercury stock associated with pollution sources on a Mediterranean
    island (Majorca, Spain)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Hg is a global concern given its adverse effects on human health,
    food security and the environment, and it requiring actions to identify major
    local Hg sources and to evaluate pollution. Our study provides the first&nbsp;assessment
    of Hg stock trends on the entire Majorca surface, identifying major Hg sources
    by studying the&nbsp;spatiotemporal soil Hg variation at two successive times
    (2006 and 2016&ndash;17). The Hg soil concentration ranged from 14 to 258 &mu;g
    kg -1 (mean 52 &mu;g kg -1). Higher concentrations (over 100 &mu;g kg-1) were
    found in two areas: (i)&nbsp;close to the Alcudia coal-fired power plant; (ii)
    in the city of La Palma. During the 11-year, the total Hg stock in&nbsp;Majorcan
    soil increased from 432.96 tons to 493.18 tones (14% increase). Based on a block
    kriging analysis, soil&nbsp;Hg enrichment due to power plant emissions was clearly
    detectable on a local scale (i.e. a shorter distance than&nbsp;18 km from the
    power plant). Nonetheless, a significant island-wide Hg increase due to diffuse
    pollution was&nbsp;reported. This result could be extrapolated to other popular
    tourist destinations in the Mediterranean islands&nbsp;where tourism has increased
    in recent decades In short, more than 60 tons of Hg have accumulated on Majorca&nbsp;island
    in 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;'
