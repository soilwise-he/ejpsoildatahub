  title: Prediction of Teak Bonita (Site Index) in Central Java, Indonesia, Based
    on Soil Properties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to determine the most correlated
    soil and physiographic factor with the site index of teak. Tree height and stand
    age were recorded from seventy-three plots located in Central Java, Indonesia,
    to determine site index. Size of each plot was 0.1 ha. Measured site properties
    measured were percent slope, elevation, slope position, slope length, dominant
    topographic form, aspect, and thickness of A horizon. Soil samples from A and
    B horizon were analyzed for soil color, soil texture, available phosphorous, total
    nitrogen, and organic matter content.&nbsp; Analysis indicated that the site index
    of teak was positively correlated with thickness of A horizon and westerly aspects,
    and negatively correlated with clay content of A horizon and elevation. A multiple
    regression using these variables produced an R2 of 0.55.&lt;/p&gt;'
