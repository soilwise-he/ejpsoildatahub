  title: Screening of soil fungi in order to biosynthesize AgNPs and evaluation of
    antibacterial and antibiofilm activities
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) has recently attracted
    a lot of research attention due to its being an eco-friendly and economical method.
    NPs are formed under normal temperatures and pressures. The shape and size of
    NPs can be controlled by choosing a suitable pH and temperature. In this study,
    24 strains of fungi isolated from desert soils were screened for AgNP synthesis.
    The MS17 isolated was chosen as the superior strain capable of rapidly synthesizing
    monodisperse AgNPs. The optimum conditions for AgNP synthesis were investigated.
    AgNPs were characterized by UV&ndash;visible spectrophotometry, dynamic light
    scattering, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier-transform
    infrared. The NPs produced were found to be in the form of Ag/AgCl with a size
    range of 5&ndash;15 nm. Then, the NPs were capped by proteins and carbohydrates,
    which play an important role in NP stability. The NPs were capable of antimicrobial
    activities against the standard bacterial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC
    27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus
    aureus ATCC 1431 and the multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa B52 and P. aeruginosa
    48.&lt;/p&gt;'
