  title: Effect of Independent Additions of Inorganic Salts of Nitrogen, Phosphorus
    and Sulphur on Sulphur Mineralisation of the Native Organic Matter in Soil
  abstract: 'Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp; Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra
    Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, Kalyani, West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript received 2
    July 1980, accepted 25 August 1980</em> Laboratory incubation studies were conducted
    on the effect of independent additions of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    and K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> on the mineralisation of sulphur in two soils.
    Sulphur mineralisation was found to be related to the initial sulphate sulphur
    and organic sulphur content of the soils. Addition of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
    widens the N: S ratio and resulted immobilisation of sulphur in soil. Depending
    upon the initial sulphate sulphur content of the soil, addition of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
    or K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> either stimulates or inhibits the net mineralisation
    of sulphur contained in the native organic matter in soil.'
