  title: Assessment of Yield of Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and Soil CO2
    Emissions as Influenced by Compost Doses and Irrigation Regimes
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>T</em><em>omato\
    \ (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is one of the most important vegetables cultivated\
    \ in Togo. Water stress constitutes one of limiting factors of production in dry\
    \ season. </em><em>Compost use improves soil properties and crop production but\
    \ may lead to soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission into atmosphere. This study assessed\
    \ the influence of compost doses and irrigation regimes on tomato yield and soil\
    \ CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Trial agronomics were conducted in dry season in year\
    \ 2018 and 2019 in a randomized complete block design with three repetitions.\
    \ Treatments included control plots, compost plots and chemical fertilizer plots.\
    \ Water was supplied according to three irrigation regimes of 1, 2 and 4 days\
    \ interval. </em><em>Tomato fruits were harvested when color was yellowish red.\
    \ Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission measurement was conducted in four months (120 days)\
    \ during field experiment from January to April in 2019</em><em>. Soil samples\
    \ were collected from plots and incubated in laboratory. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission\
    \ was measured every day during 28 day\u2019s incubation using 0.1 N HCl after\
    \ precipitating the carbonate with a BaCl2 solution by alkali back-titrating.\
    \ The results shown that highest tomato yield and highest soil CO<sub>2</sub>\
    \ emission were recorded on plots treated with compost and submitted to two days\
    \ interval irrigation while the lowest values of these parameters were obtained\
    \ from control plots and treated plots submitted to daily and four days interval\
    \ irrigation.</em><em>This was noted that CO<sub>2</sub> emission from soil samples\
    \ collected in </em><em>third and fourth months of field experiment were more\
    \ than those of first and second months.</em>"
