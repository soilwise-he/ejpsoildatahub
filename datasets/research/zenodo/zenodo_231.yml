  title: Termite mound impact on soil properties
  abstract: 'Termites are one of the dominant groups of soil macrofauna in the tropics.
    Termites belong to the order Isoptera, a group of cellulose-eating insects that
    build mounds to live. The structure of the termite mounds is complicated and has
    an extensive system of tunnels. There is a variety of shapes and sizes. The mound
    is constructed by the soil, termite saliva and dung. Though the mound appears
    to be in definite structure, it is porous in nature. Termite mounds can be observed
    in common fields may have a good source of nutrition. There are some evidences
    for the available plant nutrients in the soil, which are discussed hereunder:'
