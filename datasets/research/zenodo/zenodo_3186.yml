  title: 'Estimating Surface Cracking during Drying Sequence of Remolded Vertisol
    (Black Cotton Soil) using Fractal Approach: A Case Study of Lologo Area of Rajaf
    County, South Sudan'
  abstract: The study of cracks on vertisol soils (Black Cotton Soil ) has great significance
    for understanding the processes of soil degradation,plant nutrient uptake,and
    drawing strategic agricultural plans, as well as for engineering works and the
    development of re-vegetation techniques. An abundance of stable soil aggregates
    is an important indicator of good soil structure for sustainable crop production.
    This study aimed at a better understanding of the cracking phenomena inVertisols
    in order to be able to obtain a simple field technique that may reduce water losses
    through evaporation from cracks, yet retainstheir beneficial effects on soil profile,
    to estimate the development of cracks and their morphology during drying sequence,
    particle size distribution, its chemical and physical properties and to assess
    the causal relationships between the amount of soil moisture in vertisol and cracks
    developed and propagated.The study used a fractal approach and experiment where
    core-compost soil samples from a field site that has dark-clay soils mostly with
    very little vegetation cover were transported to the lab.The samples were left
    under natural conditions for four days to allow them to reach their plastic limit
    and the moisture content was measured using an Eijkelkamp 4-pin soil moisture
    sensor ML3 attached to a penetrologger display. The results indicated that moisture
    content reduced as the soil become drier. However, most soil samples also indicated
    constant moisture retention capacity (samples 1, 2, 4, 5, &amp; 10) with a lower
    rate of drying hence the low development of cracks in such soil samples. Meanwhile,
    soil samples (3, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9) were found with low water holding capacity
    enabling cracks to develop. The results further revealedsilt soils had about 50%
    particle size distribution and sand soils had the lowest particle size distribution
    (18.35%). The pH of the vertisol soilwas found to be 8 which is extremely alkaline.
    Magnesium was very high in this soil compared to Calcium, Nitrate nitrogen, and
    phosphorus. However, humus content was found very low (2%)and considered to be
    of low fertility grade soils. In this case, the ability of the dark-clay vertisol
    to crack is attributed to the high chemical properties of the nutrient elements.
    Therefore, in order to assess the best type of soil that is favorable for engineering
    works, settlements, agriculture, and for livestock, soils must first be tested
    for various sustainable land uses without impacting and changing the soil structure.
