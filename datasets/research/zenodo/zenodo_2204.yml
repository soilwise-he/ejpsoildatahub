  title: Effect of Soil and Foliar Nitrogen Application on Growth, Yield and Quality
    of Baby Corn Cultivars
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An imperative nitrogen management schedule attempted for the
    first time using soil application fb (followed by) foliar application at harvest
    stage to improve productivity and quality of baby corn. A two year study carried
    out in winter season with three cultivars and six schedules of recommended dose
    of nitrogen (RDN) application. Nitrogen scheduling in two, three and four splits
    compared on composite and hybrid cultivars. Crop growth, productivity traits,
    picking wise cob and corn yields, quality, plant nutrient ratios and nutrient
    harvest indices were determined. Cultivars followed the order HM-4&gt;HQPM-1&gt;Azad
    Uttam for yield components, yield and quality. HM-4 gave 7.0% and 31.6% higher
    mean baby corn yields than HQPM-1 and Azad Uttam. Soil fb foliar RDN application
    in 4 splits [50% as basal (B), 25% at knee height stage (KHS), 20% at tassel emergence
    (TE) fb 5% foliar spray after first picking (FSAFP)] recorded higher yield attributes,
    baby cob and corn yields, and quality. Cultivars and N application schedules influenced
    nutrient ratios. Nutrient harvest indices also varied in response to N application
    schedule. HM-4 can be cultivated with RDN (150 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    in 4 splits (soil fb foliar) for attaining better yield and quality of winter
    baby corn. Further studies are required for better understanding of combined approach
    under diverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
