  title: "Integration Of Cocoa Pod Ash, Poultry Manure And Npk 20:10:10 For Soil Fertility\
    \ Management \u2013 Incubation Study"
  abstract: 'A laboratory incubation study to determine the rate of nutrient supply
    by poultry manure (0, 5 and 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup>), cocoa pod ash (0, 5 and 10
    t ha<sup>-1</sup>), NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer (0 and 150 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and
    their combinations on soil properties was conducted at Igunshin in the rainforest
    zone of Southwest Nigeria. The 10 treatments were arranged in completely randomized
    design with nine replications. The soil was slightly acidic, low in OM, N, P and
    K. The incubation study showed that the soils treated with poultry manure (P)
    rates, cocoa pod ash(C) rates and their combinations significantly (p&lt;0.05)
    increased soil pH over the control and NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer (F). When poultry
    manure was combined with NPK 20: 10:10 fertilizer, the pH of the soil decreased
    as the incubation period progressed while the pH increased with combined cocoa
    pod ash and the mineral fertilizer at 90 days of incubation. The rate of decrease
    in soil pH was more pronounced in the soils treated with NPK fertilizer alone.
    Total OC, total N, exchangeable K and Mg significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased as
    the period of incubation increased in all the treatments compared with control.
    Cocoa pod ash rates and cocoa pod ash combined with NPK fertilizer increased exchangeable
    Ca as the period of incubation increased while poultry manure rates and its combinations
    with NPK fertilizer decreased at 90 days of incubation. Combined poultry manure
    and NPK fertilizer had the highest N and P while combined cocoa pod ash recorded
    the highest Ca, K and Mg. Combination of poultry manure with reduced level of
    mineral fertilizer or cocoa pod ash had positive effect on the acid soil and increased
    the rate of nutrient mineralization than the sole application of poultry manure
    or cocoa pod ash.'
