  title: A European roadmap on soil and land management
  abstract: "Soil health is vital for many ecosystem services and crucial for achieving\
    \ the Sustainable Development Goals and the European Green Deal's goals. The Horizon\
    \ Europe (HE) Mission \u201CA Soil Deal for Europe\u201D aims to accelerate the\
    \ transition to sustainable soil and land management, and healthy soils through\
    \ an ambitious transdisciplinary research and innovation (R&amp;I) programme,\
    \ largely based on actor engagement, Living Labs and Lighthouses. The H2020 Soil\
    \ Mission Support (SMS) project supports the implementation of the HE Mission\
    \ and aims to improve the coordination of R&amp;I on sustainable soil and land\
    \ management. Through a co-creation process together with actors, SMS collates\
    \ available knowledge, actors R&amp;I needs and identifies R&amp;I gaps that need\
    \ to be addressed for successful transition towards sustainable soil and land\
    \ management.<br> The presented R&amp;I roadmap on soils and land management is\
    \ a strategic document outlining the actions and the pathway to address R&amp;I\
    \ needs from different actors and sectors, as well as societal challenges. The\
    \ roadmap presents the most important R&amp;I knowledge gaps for each Soil Mission\
    \ Objective, which were iden-tified in collaboration with stakeholders from all\
    \ relevant sectors and based on the key findings of the project. To ensure that\
    \ the R&amp;I elements of the roadmap can effectively contribute to the desired\
    \ transformation of land and soil management, the impact pathways approach was\
    \ chosen as the analytical framework. The im-pact pathways are key component of\
    \ the roadmap and describe several research actions that should be taken up to\
    \ address the knowledge gaps and show what results we can expect from these actions\
    \ that will lead to a short, medium- and finally long-term impact. The results\
    \ show that to reach the eight Mission Objectives a common understanding of soil\
    \ health is needed, as well as research and innovation in both natural sciences\
    \ as well as social and economic spheres. The actions identified in the roadmap\
    \ should be closely integrated. Future projects should focus more on finding systemic\
    \ approaches to highlight synergies and minimise or avoid trade-offs while addressing\
    \ the individual soil mission objectives."
