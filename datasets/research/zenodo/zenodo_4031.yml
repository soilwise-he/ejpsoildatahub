  title: "The effect of microbial preparation on the migration of  mobile Pb forms\
    \ in the soil \u2013 winter wheat system"
  abstract: "Heavy metals (HM) take a leading position among the most common environmental\
    \ pollutants. Studying the HM\_migration ability in the soil \u2013 plant system\
    \ and searching for methods to reduce their toxic effect, particularly in agrocenosis,\_\
    is \_significant \_and \_relevant. \_The \_aim \_of \_the \_researching \_was\
    \ \_to \_determine \_the \_influence \_of \_the \_microbial \_preparation\_Phosphostim-Agro\
    \ (bioagent \u2013 phosphate-mobilizing and growth-stimulating bacterium \u2013\
    \ Lelliottia nimipressuralis CCM\_32\u20133) on the migration of lead mobile forms\
    \ in the southern chernozem \u2013 Triticum aestivum L. system. Under the conditions\_\
    of the field experiment, soil contamination was carried out with a solution of\
    \ lead acetate in amount exceeding Pb MPC by\_5, 10 and 20 times. The content\
    \ of mobile forms of lead in samples of soil, roots, straw and grain was determined\
    \ by atomic\_absorption analysis. It was revealed that when southern chernozem\
    \ was polluted with lead, the largest amount of its mobile\_forms accumulated\
    \ in the rhizosphere (54\u2013202 mg/kg) and migrated to the roots (56\u2013367\
    \ mg/kg) of winter wheat. The\_lowest content of Pb, not exceeding MPC (0.5 mg/kg),\
    \ was found in T. aestivum grain: it varied in the range of 0.05\u20130.3 mg/kg\
    \ depending on the level of soil contamination. The application of the microbial\
    \ preparation Phosphostim-Agro\_for pre-sowing inoculation of winter wheat seeds\
    \ reduced the content of mobile forms of lead, both in the rhizosphere and\_in\
    \ the aerial parts of the plants. It was revealed that in the rhizosphere of inoculated\
    \ plants, the Pb content decreased by 5\u201325 %, and in the roots, straw and\
    \ grain of bacterized plants \u2013 by 18\u201321 %, 6\u201325% and 10\u201325\
    \ %, respectively, compared to\_the variants without microbial inoculation."
