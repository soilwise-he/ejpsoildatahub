  title: Long Term Effect Of Leucaena Leucocephala On Soil Physico-Chemical Properties
    And Fresh Fruit Bunch (Ffb) Production Of Oil Palm
  abstract: The study investigated a long-term effect of <em>Leucaena</em><em> leucocephala</em>
    a leguminous tree crop on the soil physico-chemical properties and its possible
    effect on the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production of oil palm. <em>L</em><em>eucaena
    leucocephala</em> had a highly significant (P&lt;.01) effect on soil physico-chemical
    properties than the control.  The soil under <em>L</em><em>eucaena leucocephala</em>
    exhibited relatively high mean weight diameter, water retention, total soil available
    N, available P and Exchangeable cation, than the control, and thus enhanced fresh
    fruit bunch (FFB) production.  Mean fresh fruit bunch yield, over a three year
    period, was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05), with FFB yields of 10.93 tons /
    ha in plots with <em>L</em><em>eucaena leucocephala</em> as against 6.8 tons /
    ha in the control plots.
