  title: The Effect Of Soil In The Allelopathic Potential Of Artemisia Herba-Alba
    And Oudneya Africana Crude Powder On Growth Of Weeds
  abstract: "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of two type of soil\
    \ (clay and sandy soils) in the potential allelopathic effects of <em>Artemisia\
    \ herba-alba, Oudneya africana</em> crude powder (0, 1, 3 and 6%) on some growth\
    \ parameters of two weeds (<em>Bromus tectorum </em>and <em>Melilotus indica</em>)\
    \ under laboratory conditions (pot experiment).\n\n The experimental findings\
    \ have reported that the donor species crude powder concentrations were suppressing\
    \ to shoot length (SL), root length (RL) and the leaf number (LN)) in both soil\
    \ types and caused a gradual reduction particularly when they are high. However,\
    \ the reduction degree was varied and species, concentration dependent. The suppressive\
    \ effect of the two donors on the two weedy species was in the following order<em>\
    \ Melilotus indica &gt; Bromus tectorum.</em> Generally, the growth parameters\
    \ of two recipient species were significantly decreased with the increase of each\
    \ of the donor species crude powder concentration levels. Concerning the type\
    \ of soil stoical analyses indicated that significant difference between clay\
    \ and sandy soils."
