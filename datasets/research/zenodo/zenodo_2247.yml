  title: Can pedotransfer functions based on environmental variables improve soil
    total nutrient mapping at a regional scale?
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Numerous pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to
    predict the soil properties of interest from other soil properties and, less commonly,
    from environmental variables. However, only a few PTFs have been developed to
    predict soil nutrients using environmental variables and to extrapolate them to
    characterize spatial soil variations at a regional scale. In this study, we attempted
    to develop PTFs for the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium
    (TK) concentrations in three typical pedo-climatic areas of China (Fujian Province,
    Jiangsu Province and Qilian Mountains) with diverse climate, terrain and soil
    types. A series of linear PTFs were developed to quantify the effect of terrain
    and climate on the predictive relations between the soil nutrients and other measured
    soil properties and environmental variables. In addition, digital soil mapping
    (DSM) based on the random forest (RF) technique was performed to test the hypothesis
    that the best-fit PTFs could be extrapolated, based on soil maps and environmental
    variables, to describe regional soil variations in the soil nutrients. The root
    mean square errors (RMSEs) of the best-fit PTFs for TN, TP and TK ranged from
    0.21 to 0.79 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.20 to 0.58 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
    and 3.68 to 5.00 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Different
    RMSEs were produced by DSM, namely 0.37-1.89 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
    0.19&minus;0.56 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;and 3.79-4.83 g kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;for
    TN, TP and TK, respectively. PTFs provided a sound basis for database compilation
    if the soil properties were highly correlated. However, the extrapolation of best-fit
    PTFs to regional scales yielded greater errors than those produced by DSM. The
    comparison results reveal the limitations of PTFs and suggest that their performance
    could be improved by using environmental covariates or by fitting data in areas
    with relatively homogeneous soil landscapes. The DSM techniques may provide satisfactory
    alternatives to predict soil data at both regional and plot scales.&lt;/p&gt;'
