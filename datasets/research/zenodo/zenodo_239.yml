  title: "Soil Health Indicators for Scotland: Soil Health Indicators reflecting the\
    \ situation in Scotland \u2013 Are they working?"
  abstract: A structured literature search was undertaken to assess suitable soil
    health indicators covering soil chemistry, physics and biology for Scottish agricultural
    system and climate. The outcomes were ranked for the number of times mentioned
    and compared with a list of indicators created through a logical sieve method
    from work with AHDB. The indicators compared well and the the indicator for soil
    organic matter (SOM) was investigated in more detail to review the method, using
    Soilfinder website information, to create bands of good, moderate and poor SOM
    levels. This was after an outcome from a farmers meeting discussing soil quality
    where SOM was raised as an important issue. The proposed method worked well for
    most soil types but under estimated SOM in some grassland soils and gave never
    wide bands for good in upland grass soils. These may need refinement.
