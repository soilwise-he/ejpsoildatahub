  title: Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Field Programmable Gate Array
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a solution for remote monitoring and sensing
    of different agricultural parameters that effect the plant growth and productivity.
    Hardware descriptive language has been used for the implementation of proposed
    topology on Field Programmable Gate Arrays. The hardware used for this purpose
    is an Altera board. The simulated results take into consideration the environmental
    factors such as the humidity, soil moisture content and the temperature. The proposed
    system continuously monitors the environmental changes for any updates. The system
    also controls a water motor that is turned on as the system senses the reduction
    in moisture content. The system implementation on hard wave level show promising
    results and have been discussed in detailed.&lt;/p&gt;'
