  title: Influence of selected grass mulches on soil physical properties under sprinkler
    irrigation system
  abstract: "Mulching is a vital agricultural practice that affects soil moisture\
    \ retention, temperature regulation, and overall soil health. Three grass mulching\
    \ materials (Gamba (Andropogon Gayanus), Jema (Chrysopogan Zizanioides) and Kachala\
    \ (Typha Angustifolia)) at four mulching depths (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm) were examined\
    \ to assess their effects on soil moisture content, temperature, bulk density\
    \ and porosity. The study was conducted on onion plots irrigated with sprinkler\
    \ system at a constant operating pressure (100 kPa). The study was carried out\
    \ at the irrigation field laboratory of the Yelwa campus of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa\
    \ University, Bauchi. Data were analysed using SPSS software version 23. The results\
    \ indicated a significant combined impact of mulch type and depth on all studied\
    \ parameters, except for bulk density. Results showed that Kachala grass, particularly\
    \ at 15 cm depth, demonstrated superior moisture retention capabilities with 16.8%\
    \ moisture content, leading to optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth.\
    \ While the lowest soil moisture (8.81%) was conserved under the control (Un-mulched\
    \ plot). Soil temperature recorded beneath the mulch was lowest (19.1oC) under\
    \ 10 cm Kachala grass, while the highest (28.0\_oC) was recorded under 15 cm Gamba\
    \ grass. Highest soil bulk density (1.78 g/cm3) was recorded under the control,\
    \ while 15 cm depth of Kachala grass gave the lowest (1.5 g/cm3) value of bulk\
    \ density. The highest value of soil porosity (46.8%) was observed under 15 cm\
    \ Kachala grass and the lowest (34.2%) was observed under the control. In conclusion,\
    \ grass mulching has a positive effect on soil physical properties under sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system in the fadama areas of Bauchi, Nigeria."
