  title: To Study the Effect of Use of Geosynthetics Fibres in Sub grade Soil
  abstract: 'Reinforcements and separation are the two functions of Geosynthetics
    in which pavement system is used in geogrids. The apertures are used in the products
    of geogrids.These products are mostly in large size and due to this,they are not
    used for getting separation of different materials. Gradation has main function
    to separate two different materials. Still, in theoretically geogrids can also
    give some separation mathods, but in a limited amount. In pavements, geogrids
    used separation method which is a secondary function or we can say it is use for
    some sepration of different materials and in reinforcement, geogrids used the
    primary function in pavements and geogrid used to improve the mechanically properties
    of engineering like M25 Grade Concrete. The reinforcement mechanisms associated
    withgeogrids. Er. Kapil Soni | Er. Sunil Kumar | Er. Vikram "To Study the Effect
