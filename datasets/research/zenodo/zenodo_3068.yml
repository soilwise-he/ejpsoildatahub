    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Sustainable cropping systems based on low inputs are gaining attention,
    even if may determine a change on weed community composition. This study, conducted
    from 2011 to 2014, evaluates the changes of weed species under different cropping
    systems [conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG)] and soil tillage [inversion tillage
    (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NoIT)] in a wheat-tomato-chickpea rotation under
    Mediterranean environment after 12-years of cultivation. Treatments were replicated
    three times according to a randomized complete block design. The ORG was managed
    according to EU regulations. The IT consisted in moldboard plowing to a depth
    of 30 cm, while the NoIT consisted in subsoiling to a depth of 20 cm. ORG-NoIT
    showed the highest weed biomass (134.6, 128.3 and 195.4 g m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
    of DM in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively) and density (66.2, 77.3 and
    76.1 plant m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; of DM in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively),
    as well as community richness and Shannon Index. ORG always increases weed biodiversity,
    even if annual dicots were high in ORG-IT, while perennial broadleaved species
    in ORG-NoIT. CONV increased the relative frequency of annual (CONV-IT) and perennial
    (CONV-NoIT) grasses&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The negative correlation between perennial
    weeds and crop yield (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.2363, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;0.0001)
    suggests that perennial weeds was partly responsible for the crop yield reduction.
    Combining organic practices with non-inversion tillage could lead to the establishment
    of perennial dicots difficult to manage, which requires the adoption of new management
    practices.&lt;/p&gt;'
