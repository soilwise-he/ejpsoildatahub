  title: Long-Term Compost Amendment Changes Interactions and Specialization in the
    Soil Bacterial Community, Increasing the Presence of Beneficial N-Cycling Genes
    in the Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Significant differences in the microbial community and diversity
    in soil have been observed due to organic farming, but little research has been
    performed for exploring microbial functionality and the co-occurrence of patterns
    among microbial taxa. In this work, we study soil 16S rDNA amplicons from two
    long-term organic farming systems (Org_C and Org_M) and a conventional system
    (Conv) to decipher the differences in microbial interaction and network organization
    and to predict functional genes (principally related to the N cycle). In general,
    the network organizations were different in all cropping systems due to agricultural
    management. Org_C showed the highest negative interactions and modularity and
    the most altered bacterial niches and interactions, which led to an increase in
    generalist species that stabilize the bacterial community and improve the response
    of the soil to adverse conditions. These changes altered the predicted functionality
    of the bacterial community; Org_C showed higher referred numbers of nitrogen fixation
    genes, a decrease in the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission genes and could favor
    the uptake of environmental CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, long-term compost
    amendment application has significant benefits for the farmer and the environment,
    since prolonged application can reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides and
    could create a more stable soil, which could resist the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;'
