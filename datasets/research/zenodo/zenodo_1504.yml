  title: An Experimental Study on Strength and Compressibility Response of Plastic
    Fibre Reinforced Soil
  abstract: Rapid growth in industrialization and urbanization, leads to an increasing
    scarcity of lands which is intending to utilize the available lands even though
    it is problematic in nature. Problematic nature of soils leads to high plasticity
    characteristics, low shear strength and high swell shrinkage characteristics.
    These soils can be used for construction purposes only after adopting suitable
    ground improvement techniques. On the other side huge volume of wastes from daily
    life resulting in disposal problems and soil contamination and health issues.
    In geotechnical view point plastic is a fibrous material that used for reinforcing
    the soil is commonly known and it also influences the compaction and consolidation
    behavior of that reinforced soil. View of the above, the present study is experimented
    to study the feasibility of highly compressible clayey soil treated with HDPE
    fiber in three aspect ratios (AR = l/b), 2(10x5mm), 4(10x2.5mm), 8(10x1.25mm)
    at four different percentages 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 by dry weight of soil. The
    stabilized soil properties to be characterized by California bearing ratio test
    (CBR), Unconfined Compression Test (UCC) and Consolidation Test.
