  title: Identifying Dynamic Structural Parameters Of  Soil-Structure System Based
    On Data Recorded During Strong Earthquakes
  abstract: "In many applied engineering problems, structural analysis is usually\
    \ conducted by assuming a rigid bed, while imposing the effect of structure bed\
    \ flexibility can affect significantly on the structure response. This article\
    \ focuses on investigation and evaluation of the effects arising from considering\
    \ a soil-structure system in evaluation of dynamic characteristics of a steel\
    \ structure with respect to elastic and inelastic behaviors. The recorded structure\
    \ acceleration during Taiwan\u2019s strong Chi-Chi earthquake on different floors\
    \ of the structure was our evaluation criteria. The respective structure is an\
    \ eight-story steel bending frame structure designed using a displacement-based\
    \ direct method assuring weak beam - strong column function. The results indicated\
    \ that different identification methods i.e. reverse Fourier transform or transfer\
    \ functions, is capable to determine some of the dynamic parameters of the structure\
    \ precisely, rather than evaluating all of them at once (mode frequencies, mode\
    \ shapes, structure damping, structure rigidity, etc.). Response evaluation based\
    \ on the input and output data elucidated that the structure first mode is not\
    \ significantly affected, even considering the soil-structure interaction effect,\
    \ but the upper modes have been changed. Also, it was found that the response\
    \ transfer function of the different stories, in which plastic hinges have occurred\
    \ in the structure components, provides similar results."
