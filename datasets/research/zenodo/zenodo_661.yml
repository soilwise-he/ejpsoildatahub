  title: Smartphone-based tension disc infiltrometer for soil hydraulic characterisation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The tension disc infiltrometer has become a widespread method
    to measure soil hydraulic properties under unsaturated conditions. Although several
    automated devices have been developed, most designs include an elongated water
    reservoir and a pressure transducer with electronic components to register the
    water level, increasing its cost and limiting its application. The objective of
    this work is to present a new tension disc infiltrometer with a compact design
    of 10&nbsp;cm diameter and height, where the water level is monitored by a smartphone
    camera. The infiltration curve is determined from the automated analysis of the
    images recorded by the smartphone without additional electronic components. The
    device was first validated in the laboratory by comparing visual measurements
    (V), the camera imagery (Ca) and a pressure transducer (PT). Next, it was tested
    on field infiltration experiments. Robust fits (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&nbsp;0.99)
    were found between the water level measured with Ca in the laboratory and those
    obtained with V and PT procedures. The Ca method is accurate, robust and independent
    of the relative camera position. Good fits were also observed between Ca water
    level and those obtained with PT in the field experiments. Similar hydraulic conductivity
    and sorptivity values were obtained with both sensors using the numerical solution
    of the Haverkamp (NSH) equation. The compact infiltrometer, in conjunction with
    the smartphone camera, is an accurate, accessible, portable and easy-to-use field-based
    device for soil hydraulic characterisation.&lt;/p&gt;'
