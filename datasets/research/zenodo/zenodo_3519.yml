  title: Soil Moisture Based Irrigation Test In A Remotely Monitored Automated System.
  abstract: The proposed paper aims at determining the most efficient soil moisture
    monitoring method in an intelligent remotely monitored system. The project also
    demonstrates the economic viability of an integrated system of production were
    water requirement, nutrients and pH are kept optimum automatically. The system
    is designed to overcome the challenges of water wastage, nutrition deficit, pH
    imbalance and leaching of nutrients. This system is powered by Solar System, controlled
    by Microcontroller and programmed using LabVIEW Software. The Microcontroller
    is connected GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) wireless network, which
    allows the system to communicate with the farmer remotely using a mobile phone.
    This proposed smart farming technology is environmentally friendly, efficient,
    cost effective and gives the farmer the power to control and monitor production
    in real time
