  title: Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of toxin proteins
    of Bacillus thuringiensis isolated from soil at the Liwa Botanical Garden
  abstract: "Bacillus thuringiensis\_is a spore-forming bacterium known to have the\
    \ ability to synthesize proteins that are toxic against insect pests. Currently,\
    \ the bacterial protein toxins are widely used as pesticides because they are\
    \ environmentally friendly and safe for health. As a cosmopolitan microbe\_B.\
    \ thuringiensis\_is widely distributed in nature with soil as its main habitat.\
    \ Liwa Botanical Gardens is one among the conservation areas in Lampung Province\
    \ of Indonesia where the soil type and conditions expected to good for the bacterial\
    \ life of\_B. thuringiensis.\_This study aims to determine toxin proteins extracted\
    \ from\_B. thuringiensis isolated from the soil of the Liwa Botanical Garden by\
    \ their molecular weights. The proteins were quantified using Lowry method and\
    \ the protein profiling performed using SDS PAGE electrophoresis. The results\
    \ showed that there were two isolates, Bt 3 and Bt 5 which showed close protein\
    \ concentrations, namely 0.679 mg/ml and Bt 5 with 1.313 mg/ml respectively. Both\
    \ isolates also exhibit different molecular weights. Bt 3 isolate has a molecular\
    \ weight of 110.59 kDa, while Bt 5 has a molecular weight of 76.97 kDa."
