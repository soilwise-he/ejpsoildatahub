  title: Custom-Built Wireless Sensor Networks To Monitor Soil Moisture
  abstract: The temporal change of soil moisture storage is one of the most critical
    pieces of information required for efficient irrigation management. Measurement
    of soil moisture in the past was very expensive and accounting for spatial variability
    was largely impractical. Recent technological developments now make it possible
    to monitor soil moisture in near real time using wireless sensor networks.  This
    paper presents a successful application of custom-built wireless mesh sensor networks
    based on DigiMesh protocol, a proprietary technology developed by Digi International
    Inc. to monitor spatial distribution of soil moisture in near real time. Our system
    is designed to transport the measured data from wireless sensor networks in the
    field to cloud data base servers over cellular networks or Iridium satellites.
    Data are then processed to make them available on smart phone-compatible web browsers
    in near real time to help practitioners plan their precision irrigation scheduling.
