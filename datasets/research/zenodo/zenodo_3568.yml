  title: The Behavior of Clay Soil under the Effect of Cyclic Loading
  abstract: The behavior of soil appropriate to earthquake and maritime problems may
    studied by performing alternating cyclic simple shear and triaxial tests. The
    main purpose of this present research is to evaluate the strength reduction of
    saturated untrained clay soils under direct shear cyclic stress. The test results
    revealed that such reduction exists and it increased with increasing cyclic stress
    amplitude, confining pressure, the number of loading cycles and with decreasing
    sample thickness. The results indicate that there is a lower limit to the cyclic
    stress ratio below which cyclic loading has a negligible effect on clay softening.
    It is observed also that the direct cyclic strength is greater than the triaxial
    cyclic strength which conforms to the published results.eng
