  title: 'Linking soil properties to permittivity data: Beyond the Complex Refractive
    Index Model'
  abstract: "The availability of reliable constitutive models linking the bulk electric\
    \ properties\nof porous media to their inner structure is a key requirement for\
    \ useful quantitative\napplications of non invasive methods. In this paper we\
    \ focus on the use of dielectric\nmeasurements for (time-lapse) monitoring of\
    \ fluid saturation changes in porous\nmaterials, e.g. via Time Domain Reflectometry\
    \ (TDR) or ground penetrating radar\n(GPR). A number of empirical, semi-empirical\
    \ and theoretical relationships have been\nproposed, linking the bulk dielectric\
    \ constant with volumetric water content. Among\nthe most popular are mixing models\
    \ that involve some form of weighted average of the\ndielectric constants of the\
    \ components. One such model, named CRIM (complex\nrefractive index model) or\
    \ LR (Lichteneker-Rother) has found extensive application in\nrecent years. In\
    \ this paper we first analyze the characteristics of the CRIM by means\nof theoretical\
    \ considerations, thus drawing a link between the CRIM and the well\nknown Archie\u2019\
    s law used for the analysis of DC resistivity in porous media. Next, we\nuse pore-scale\
    \ modelling and experimental results to show other characteristics of\nthe CRIM,\
    \ and in particular the dependence of its parameters on dielectric properties\n\
    of the components, as well as on porosity. We then proceed to assess the robustness\n\
    of the identification of CRIM parameters in presence of synthetic data error,\
    \ thus\nconcluding that CRIM parameters cannot, in general, be independently identified\
    \ on\nthe basis of bulk dielectric constant versus moisture content data. A novel\n\
    theoretical model for the dielectric response of saturated porous media is proposed\n\
    in the second section. The new constitutive relationship incorporates the theoretical\n\
    link with Archie\u2019s law as well as a combination of the well established Hashin\
    \ and\nShtrikman bounds. The proposed model is shown to be able to match both\
    \ experimental\nand pore-scale modelling data with no use of ad-hoc fitting parameters."
