  title: Alpine soil microbial ecology in a changing world
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Climate change has a disproportionally large impact on alpine
    soil ecosystems, leading to pronounced changes in soil microbial diversity and
    function associated with effects on biogeochemical processes at the local and
    supraregional scales. However, due to restricted accessibility, high-altitude
    soils remain largely understudied and a considerable heterogeneity hampers the
    comparability of different alpine studies. Here, we highlight differences and
    similarities between alpine and arctic ecosystems, and we discuss the impact of
    climatic variables and associated vegetation and soil properties on microbial
    ecology. We consider how microbial alpha-diversity, community structures and function
    change along altitudinal gradients and with other topographic features such as
    slope aspect. In addition, we focus on alpine permafrost soils, harboring a surprisingly
    large unknown microbial diversity and on microbial succession along glacier forefield
    chronosequences constituting the most thoroughly studied alpine habitat. Finally,
    highlighting experimental approaches, we present climate change studies showing
    shifts in microbial community structures and function in response to warming and
    altered moisture, interestingly with some contradiction. Collectively, despite
    harsh environmental conditions, many specially adapted microorganisms are able
    to thrive in alpine environments. Their community structures strongly correlate
    with climatic, vegetation and soil properties and thus closely mirror the complexity
    and small-scale heterogeneity of alpine soils.&lt;/p&gt;'
