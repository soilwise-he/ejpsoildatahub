  title: "The \u201CStick-Slip\u201D Phenomenon During The Active Earth Pressure Failure\
    \ Of A Granular Soil Of Analogical Material"
  abstract: The aim of this paper is to highlight the "stick-slip" phenomenon in the
    mechanisms of failure related to active earth pressure of an analogical material
    simulating a granular medium.  For this, a two-dimensional small-scale model was
    used and a phenomenological analysis of these mechanisms was conducted employing
    measurements of the fields of deformations using the method of digital image correlation.
    It was noted that a fluctuation in the response of the material occurs during
    the equal increments of displacements imposed on the mobile wall. This incremental
    response of the medium during the failure process related to active earth pressure
    explains the  "stick-slip" phenomenon.
