  title: Short-term soil formation events in last glacial east European loess, evidence
    from multi-method luminescence dating
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Here we provide a robust luminescence chronology for Stayky
    (Ukraine), a reference profile in European&lt;br&gt;

    Late Pleistocene loess stratigraphy, based on optically stimulated luminescence
    (OSL) dating on quartz (4&lt;br&gt;

    e11 mm, 63e90 mm) and post infrared-infrared stimulated luminescence (pIR-IRSL))
    on polymineral fine&lt;br&gt;

    grains. For the Bug loess unit, the equivalent of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 2),
    results are in agreement&lt;br&gt;

    between methods, demonstrating that the suite of embryonic soils previously interpreted
    as reflecting&lt;br&gt;

    climate variability similar to Greenland interstadials (GI) actually date to ~29/27-15
    ka, with most&lt;br&gt;

    emplaced around or after 20 ka. This temporal span is further confirmed by age-depth
    modelling of&lt;br&gt;

    available data. Apart from GI-2, no interstadial-type climate events are recorded
    in Greenland ice core&lt;br&gt;

    data for that time interval. As short-term pedogenetic phases are also documented
    in records from&lt;br&gt;

    central-western Europe, there is a need for more research into the European mid-latitude
    terrestrial&lt;br&gt;

    environments response to MIS 2 hydroclimate variability.&lt;br&gt;

    The dating of Vytachiv paleosol, previously debatably linked to various GI events
    within MIS 3 resulted&lt;br&gt;

    in ages of ~40 &plusmn; 4 ka and ~53 &plusmn; 4 ka at the lower transition, and
    ~26 &plusmn; 2 ka to ~30 &plusmn; 2 ka in the overlying&lt;br&gt;

    loess. These ages indicate that the truncated Vytachiv paleosol is either not
    continuous, or that it encompasses&lt;br&gt;

    a broader age range within MIS 3 than previously considered. In both cases, data
    would not&lt;br&gt;

    allow for an unambiguous linking of this paleosol with specific GI events as previously
    attempted.&lt;br&gt;

    The pIR-IRSL290 dating of the loams immediately underneath Pryluky unit in the
    range of ~120 ka to&lt;br&gt;

    ~168 ka and of the Pryluky mollisol from ~90 ka to 126 ka confirm the broad correspondence
    of this unit&lt;br&gt;

    with MIS 5, although poor dose recovery results open the possibility for further
    testing on the degree&lt;br&gt;

    these ages provide overestimated results. Quartz data severely underestimate the
    pIR-IRSL290 ages for&lt;br&gt;

    these samples. The application of pIR-IRSL290 dating for the underlying Dnieper
    till previously linked to&lt;br&gt;

    the Saalian glaciation resulted in natural signals at the level of laboratory
    saturation, yielding minimum&lt;br&gt;

    ages of c. 700 ka. For the same sample, the natural SAR-OSL signals for 4e11 mm
    quartz were found&lt;br&gt;

    significantly below laboratory saturation level, resulting in finite ages of ~250e270
    ka interpreted here as&lt;br&gt;

    underestimates, while coarse quartz (63e90 mm) signals reached about 85% of the
    laboratory saturation&lt;br&gt;

    level. These data suggest extreme caution must be taken when dating such old samples
    using quartz OSL.&lt;br&gt;

    Results from our high-resolution luminescence dating raises important implications
    for the chronological&lt;br&gt;

    representativeness of Stayky as a key loess site in Eastern Europe beyond MIS
    2.&lt;/p&gt;'
