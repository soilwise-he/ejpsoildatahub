  title: RESPONSE OF ENTOPHYTIC BACTERIA FROM BABY MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.) ROOTS WITH
    N2 FERTILIZER ON SOIL CHEMICAL ATTRIBUTE, GROWTH AND YIELD OF BABY CORN
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> The effect of three different nitrogen rates
    (0, 175 and 350 kg N/ha) and three entophytic bacteria of <em>Bacillus aryabhattai</em>,
    <em>Bacillus megaterium and Enterobacter asburiae</em> on soil chemical attributes,
    growth and yield of baby corn was researched outside net house in An Giang university
    during July of 2023. The experiment was designed by using split plots based on
    randomized complete block design with nine treatments and four replications. Results
    observed that different nitrogen fertilizer ratios affected significant on soil
    chemical properties (Available phosphorous, total nitrogen and organic matter),
    cob length, cob diameter, biomass and ear number per plant. However, nitrogen
    rates and entophytic bacteria were insignificantly affected plant height, leaf
    number and total chlorophyll per plant. Interaction impact between nitrogen and
    bacteria was almost affected on yield composition, fresh yield of baby corn parts.
    The highest edible cob yield (5.33 t/ha) was that of application of 350 kg N/ha
    and 5.39 t/ha at inoculation of<em> Enterobacter asburiae</em>. It is concluded
    that greatest dose of nitrogen and entophytic bacterium for baby corn crop is
    350 kgN/ ha and<em> Enterobacter asburiae</em>. It is also needed that enhance
    study should be carried out under different rhizosphere entophytic bacteria
