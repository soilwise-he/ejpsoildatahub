  title: Sorptive interactions of Cu on soil, clay and humic acid
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya-824 234, Bihar,
    India <em>Manuscript received 6 August 2009, accepted 11 November 2009</em> Sorption
    and desorption of Cu on soils from four different locations of West Bengal have
    been studied. Sorption on humic acid and clays of the soils has also been measured.
    Measurements have been made at a pH or 6.0 without any back ground electrolyte.
    Comparison of sorption behavior of the soils have been made on the basis of the
    Langmuir parameters. One of the soils is very rich In organic matter and others
    are progressively poorer in it though richer in clay content. This enables us
    to make some guess on the role or each of the constituents on overall adsorption.
    Humic acids and clays Isolated from each soli have also been tested for adsorption
    efficiency. Adsorption maxima for all these constituents fall far below their
    individual CEC. Experiments have been done on soil residues after removal of mobile
    organic matter by alkali extraction. A drop in adsorption maxima has been observed
    although the decrease will not up to the theoretically calculated amount betraying
    a more complicated combined existence of humus and clay in native soil. Desorption
    experiment have been carried out in solutions of NaCl, KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and<strong>
    </strong>CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The desorbing efficiency of the ions was found to be
    in the decreasing order of Ca<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &gt; &gt; K<sup>+</sup>
    &gt; Na<sup>+</sup>. This result suggests predominantly an ion-exchange reaction.
