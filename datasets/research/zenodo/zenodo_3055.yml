  title: Magnesium And Phosphorien Applications Improve The Efficiency Of Growth And
    Productivity Of Squash (Cucurbita Pepo L.) Plants Grown On A Sandy Calcareous
    Soil
  abstract: "Two field experiments were carried out to study the effects of soil inoculation\
    \ with phosphorien-containing phosphate-dissolving bacteria (PDB) and/or magnesium\
    \ (Mg) foliar application at the rates of 0, 0.5 and 1 mM on the growth, some\
    \ chemical constituents and fruit yield and its quality of squash (Cucurbita pepo\
    \ L) grown on a sandy calcareous soil. The experiment were performed in a completely\
    \ randomized blocks design with six treatments, each one with four replicates.\
    \ The results indicated that PDB and/or Mg significantly increased stem length,\
    \ canopy dry weight plant\u20131, number of leaves plant \u20131, stem length,\
    \ canopy dry weight plant\u20131, number of leaves plant\u20131, leaf area leaf\u2013\
    1, leaf area plant\u20131, leaf contents of pigments, free proline, nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) and the ratio\
    \ of Ca/Na, while leaf Na content was reduced. The application of PDB and/or Mg\
    \ also increased fruit yield and its components (i.e., number of fruits plant\u2013\
    1, fruit weight plant\u20131 and fruit yield fed\u20131). It has been concluded\
    \ that the applications of Mg and PDB have pronounced a positive reflection on\
    \ the growth, fruit yield and its components of squash plants grown on sandy calcareous\
    \ soil. PDB and Mg, therefore, have the potential to be used as a soil inoculation\
    \ and foliar application, respectively for squash and may for various crops to\
    \ overcome the adverse effects of the newly-reclaimed sandy calcareous soils."
