  title: Monitoring The Content of Heavy Metals in The Soil and Wines from Different
    Wine-Growing Areas of Romania
  abstract: "Determination of heavy metals in soil and wine is very important for\
    \ wine quality and consumer health, but at the same time it is a complementary\
    \ tool for differentiating wines according to their geographical origin. In this\
    \ work, soils and ten brands of wines originated from four major wine-growing\
    \ areas of Romania (Ia\u015Fi, Babadag, \u015Etef\u0103ne\u015Fti and Blaj) were\
    \ considered for performing a multielement (Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Pb, Hg, V, Sr, Mn,\
    \ Zn, Fe) investigation in order to assess regional specificity. Heavy metals\
    \ found in the investigated wines were below the limits imposed by European standards\
    \ (O.I.V.) the elements concentrations following the trend: Zn&gt;Fe&gt;Mn&gt;Sr&gt;Ni&gt;Cr&gt;Cu&gt;Pb&gt;V&gt;Hg&gt;As.\
    \ For the soils analyzed, the heavy metals content was found to be below the maximum\
    \ permitted limit, except for Cu (135.45 mg/kg) from the Ia\u015Fi vineyard, which\
    \ was at the permitted limit. The high values obtained for copper may be the result\
    \ of different treatments with the Bordelaise solution for the vine. The elements\
    \ CA, Mn and Hg observed from the research that they are predominantly of natural\
    \ origin. Based on our results, a distinction has been made between wines according\
    \ to their geographical origin, considering that the specific elements of discrimination\
    \ Sr, Pb, and Ni for the Stef\u0103nesti vineyard (Muntenia region), Cr and Hg\
    \ for the Babadag vineyard (Dobrogea region), Sr and V for the Ia\u015Fi vineyard\
    \ (region of Moldova), respectively Fe and Zn for the Blaj vineyard (Transilvania\
    \ region)."
