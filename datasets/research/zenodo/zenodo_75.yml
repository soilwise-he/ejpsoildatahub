  title: Soil organic carbon as a source of soil fertility and productivity Breed
  abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is considered the key indicator of soil
    health and the essence of life on earth heavily depends on it. The capacity of
    a soil to support ecosystem functions along with sustain environmental quality
    and biological productivity while promoting plant and animal health has been defined
    as soil health. Therefore, the domain of soil health comprises of human, animal,
    ecosystem and health aspects. Though under soil organic content, fresh and undecomposed
    plant materials do not make their contribution however it is a major product of
    decomposed soil organic matter (SOM) and it got build up slowly after the decomposition
    of plants and animals as well as micro-organisms. Since long time, farmers and
    scientists remained well aware of the importance of soil organic carbon (SOC)
    in respect of soil health and the sustainable agriculture development therefore,
    soil organic carbon plays a key role in many soil functions. Soil organic carbon
    content not only stabilizes soil structure and improves aggregation that linked
    to reduce the soil erosion, improves water absorption capacity but also influenced
    on the less retention of pesticides and other inorganic pollutants by being virtue
    of their enhanced mobilization and degradation. Activities, such as increasing
    nutrients cycling and storage, buffers crop production against water shortages
    etc. followed to maintain soil fertility and the activities enhanced the soil
    porosity and aeration, water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity of soil
    which on turn provides a habitat and food source for soil organisms that ultimately
    improve soil biodiversity and health. Hence, the SOC stock exhibits the long-term
    balance between additions of organic carbon (OC) from different sources and its
    losses through different pathways.
