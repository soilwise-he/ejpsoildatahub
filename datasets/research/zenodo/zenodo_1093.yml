  title: Exchange Behaviour of Coen 33+ on Soil and Peat Humic Acids
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, North Bengal University, Darjeeling-734 430<br>\
    \ <em>Manuscript recemed 4 March 1986, accepted 12 August 1986</em> The exchange\
    \ behaviour of Coen\\(_8^8\\)<sup>+</sup> on soil and peat humic acids (SHA and\
    \ PHA) shows that the exchange isotherms resemble Langmuir type of curves and\
    \ the uptake of this complex ion depends on pH. At lower pH, stronger acidic groups,\
    \ <em>e.g. </em>COOH group predominantly participate in the interactions. The\
    \ release isotherms obtained by using different electrolytes display the order\
    \ of reactivity, Li&lt;Na&lt;K&lt;Rb&lt;Cs&lt;&lt; H for the monovalent. mg&lt;\
    \ Ca &lt;Sr &lt;Ba for the bivalent, and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>N&lt;(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)N\
    \ for the organic cations. The exchange isotherms with monovalent cations exhibit\
    \ that the exchange processes take place in three stages. By using Kielland's\
    \ equa\xADtion, thermodynamic equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energy change\
    \ for exchange reactions involving bivalent cations have been computed. log of\
    \ corrected selectivity coefficients or thermodynamic equilibrium cons\xADtants\
    \ have been plotted against hydrated ionic radii and the reciprocals of Debye-Huckel\
    \ parameter \u03B1\xB0. The plots suggest that the relative affinities of the\
    \ counter ions for the exchanger substrates are much better correlated with \u03B1\
    \xB0 rather than with ionic radii."
