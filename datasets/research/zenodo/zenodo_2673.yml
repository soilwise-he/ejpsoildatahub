  title: Experimental Investigation on Fiber Reinforced Concrete with Partial Replacement
    of Fine Aggregate with Red Soil and Using Polypropylene Fiber
  abstract: The task manages association of polypropylene fiber with built up concrete
    here M20 grade of cement have been embraced. The blend configuration is done dependent
    on IS10262 code 2009. Polypropylene fiber is utilized in cement to expand the
    elasticity and diminishes breaking. The examples are relieved for 28 days and
    afterward tested. The paper presents research work of test examination on polypropylene
    fiber built up concrete by supplanting the 1/third of the waterway sand with red
    soil and utilizing polypropylene fiber. Utilization of fiber built up polypropylene
    in structural designing increment quickly. Different sort of fiber is utilized
    like glass, carbon, steel, asbestos, polyester and polypropylene. The different
    trial examinations accomplished for deciding the properties of polypropylene fiber
    are talked about in this paper. This paper presents the impact of polypropylene
    (PP) strands on different properties of cement like compressive strength, elasticity,
    and usefulness with different substance of fiber (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%). The
    consequence of this current examination demonstrates that by adding of 1.5% of
    polypropylene fiber shows most extreme compressive and elasticity.
