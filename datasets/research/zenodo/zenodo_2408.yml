  title: 'Influence of slurry acidification with H2SO4 on soil pH, N, P, S, and C
    dynamics: Incubation experiment'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Acidifying slurry with sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)\
    \ is practiced in some countries for reducing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)\
    \ emissions during slurry storage and spreading to land. However, knowledge on\
    \ how the application of acidified slurry affects soil health and nutrient cycling\
    \ is lacking. This is particularly important since acidification with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;can\
    \ substitute a sulfur (S) mineral fertilizer to increasingly S-deficient agricultural\
    \ soils. We hypothesized that (\u2170) slurry acidification would decrease the\
    \ soil pH over a prolonged period, and as a result (\u2171) would increase the\
    \ extractable N, P, C and S concentrations, (\u2172) and decrease greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions. By using laboratory mesocosms, the nutrient (C, N, P and S) dynamics\
    \ were monitored in an arable sandy clay loam soil receiving acidified and non-acidified\
    \ cattle slurry in a 2-month incubation. Estimations of greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O),\
    \ soil-pore- water components (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&minus;&lt;/sup&gt;,\
    \ NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&minus;&lt;/sup&gt;,\
    \ SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, DOC, DON, pH) were\
    \ performed on static mesocosms. In addition, a parallel set of mesocosms were\
    \ used for soil extractions using distilled water and 0.5 M K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.\
    \ There were six treatments: (1) soil (control), (2) soil&nbsp;+&nbsp;slurry,\
    \ (3) soil&nbsp;+&nbsp;acidified slurry (with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,\
    \ pH =5.5), (4) soil&nbsp;+&nbsp;HCl, (5) soil&nbsp;+&nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,\
    \ and (6) soil&nbsp;+&nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.\
    \ Our results showed that over the incubation, slurry acidification reduced soil\
    \ pH by at least 0.4 units. Water soluble PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&minus;&lt;/sup&gt;-P\
    \ concentration was also reduced, whilst extractable DOC and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&mdash;&lt;/sup&gt;N\
    \ concentrations were increased; the latter as a result of stimulated N mineralization\
    \ in the acidification treatments (3, 4 and 6). Differences in water soluble SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;-S\
    \ concentrations per treatment were not significant over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Slurry\
    \ acidification did not significantly affect N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions\
    \ but decreased net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;emissions\
    \ leading to an overall reduction in the soil's total greenhouse gas footprint\
    \ (expressed as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e). We conclude that application of\
    \ acidified slurry to soil can reduce soil pH by at least 0.4 pH units for up\
    \ to 2-months before it is buffered back to the pH level of the soil that received\
    \ the non-acidified slurry. In addition to increasing organic N mineralization\
    \ with limited impacts on P and S dynamics of the soil and the slurry.&lt;/p&gt;"
