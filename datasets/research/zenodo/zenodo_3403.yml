  title: Improvement Of Soil Behavior By Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitates
  abstract: Nowadays, the recent development of cities leads to construction of many
    high rise buildings which needs a strong and good foundation. So, it is important
    to improve the properties of soil. The process of improving the properties of
    soil is known as soil stabilization. In recent days, chemical methods are widely
    used for treating soil to improve the properties. In addition to that of chemical
    methods, an attempt has been made using micro-organisms, nutrients that are naturally
    present in subsurface soil which precipitate calcites to improve the engineering
    properties of soil in sustainable way. In this process, a species <em>bacillus</em>group,
    <em>B.megaterium</em> was used to activate and catalyze the calcite precipitation
    by adding reagents to it. This is made on the soil sample that had taken from
    Pachapalayam, Coimbatore. The concentration of cementation reagents and duration
    of treatment are the two parameters included in this project. The results in this
    project showed that with the use of MICP (microbial induced calcite precipitates),
    there was an increment in strength of soil. However, to adopt the microbial methods
    effectively, microbiological, ecological studies and design considerations are
    required.
