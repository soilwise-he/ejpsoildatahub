  title: Macrostructural level of the soil resources management (as an example of
    Lankaran Lowland)
  abstract: 'The article presents a description of three hierarchical-structural levels
    of soil resources management using the example of the Lenkoran Lowland (macro,
    meso and microstructures). The first level is management at the macrostructural
    level: distribution and management of soil resources by categories (agricultural
    soils, settlements, forests, water and reserve funds, industry, transport, communications,
    defence and the soil of specially protected areas, etc.). The second level is
    the management of the mesostructural level: the placement and management of economic
    lands (arable land, perennial plantings, steam, hayfields, pastures and pastures).
    The third level is the microstructural level of management: the distribution of
    crops or plant groups and the implementation of the management of the corresponding
    systems of measures. A system of land management measures has been developed at
    the microstructure level.'
