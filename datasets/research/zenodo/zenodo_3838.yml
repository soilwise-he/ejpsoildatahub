  title: Attenuation Rate of Unconfined Compressive Strength Due to Drying-Wetting
    Cycle of a Clayey Soil
  abstract: "There are different climatic regions of soil that are often influenced\
    \ by a lot of drying-wetting cycles due to seasonal variations. Such seasonal\
    \ disparity in water content is termed as a drying-wetting cycle. It can be considered\
    \ as the most critical factor for soil strength. Due to the world-wide dissemination\
    \ of soils that are largely used as construction element, geotechnical engineers\
    \ are attracted in determining the mechanical behaviour of soils. The purpose\
    \ of this study is to understand the effects of the attenuation rate of strength\
    \ of the soil due to the various drying-wetting cycle. The unconfined compression\
    \ strength test was carried out on a number of undisturbed samples of clayey soil\
    \ attained from Godagari, Rajshahi which was subjected to various drying-wetting\
    \ cycle. Unconfined compressive strength values were acquired for the 0, 2, 4\
    \ and 8th drying \u2013 wetting cycles. The results mean that the peak stresses\
    \ diminish with increasing drying-wetting cycles. The reduction is more noticeable\
    \ in the 2nd cycle and cuts with subsequent cycles and lastly reaches to a constant\
    \ state after 8th cycles. Again, a calculated function is offered in this study\
    \ that can measure the shear strength reduction degree of samples from the drying-wetting\
    \ cycle."
