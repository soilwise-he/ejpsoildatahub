  title: Effects Of Different Fire Severity Levels On Soil Chemical And Physical Properties
    In Zagros Forests Of Western Iran
  abstract: "The study focused on the effect of different intensities of fire on physical\
    \ and chemical properties of soil in Zagros forests of western Iran. The dominant\
    \ tree species in these forests is oak (Quercus persica). Three sites were selected;\
    \ high severity burned site (HS), low severity burned site (LS) and control (not\
    \ burned) site (C). Soil chemical properties such as: organic matter (OM), the\
    \ total nitrogen (N), NO3-N, soluble potassium (K), soil phosphorus (P), pH, soil\
    \ electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), base cations\
    \ (Ca, Mg, Na), CO2 and soil physical<br>\nproperties such as saturation percentage\
    \ (SP), bulk density (BD), sand, clay and silt percentages were assessed in soil\
    \ samples. To determine significance of differences among the three observed sites\
    \ and most effective variables in the separation of sample plots, one-way analysis\
    \ of variance and principal component analysis were used, respectively.<br>\n\
    Mean pH, N, NO3- N, OM, SP, P, K, and CEC at HS site were lower than at the sites\
    \ with other fire intensities but the EC value for HS site was higher in comparison\
    \ with other sites observed. According to Duncan\u2019s test, mean BD<br>\nvalue\
    \ for HS site was higher when compared with other sites but SP value was comparatively\
    \ lowest. At LS site, mean sand content was lowest and the amount of silt was\
    \ highest, in comparison with other sites. The results showed that observed fire\
    \ severities had significant effects on physical and chemical properties of soil,\
    \ yet fire low severity and control sites were very similar to each other in terms\
    \ of investigated factors. Therefore, it can be concluded that lowseverity fire\
    \ regime has no significant influence on soil properties. In a management strategy,\
    \ controlled low-severity fire regime can be an alternative management tool in\
    \ improving soil conditions."
