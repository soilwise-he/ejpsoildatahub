  title: Effect of Continuous Application of Organic Manure on the Physical Properties
    of Soil in a Rice-Wheat Cropping System
  abstract: This article 'Effect of Continuous Application of Organic Manure on the
    Physical Properties of Soil in a Rice-Wheat Cropping System' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
