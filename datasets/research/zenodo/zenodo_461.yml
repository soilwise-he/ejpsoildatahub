  title: Sustainable soil management in the Badacsony Wine District
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agricultural landscapes with historical hillside vineyard cultivation
    have a touristic, economic, and environmental value in the Balaton uplands. However,
    sustainable cultivation methods are becoming increasingly important within today&#39;s
    adaptation to climate change impacts on these lands much exposed to erosion. Our
    long-term field experiment compared the effects of several soil-cover methods
    in several aspects. We recorded and examined the consequent changes in the physical
    (soil moisture), chemical (absorbable nitrogen content), biological (enzyme activity:
    fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and dehydrogenase), the most probable number
    of bacteria and fungi), and economic (yield) parameters of soils. According to
    our results in 2017, mulching with organic plant wastes achieved the most positive
    effect on the parameters studied and also efficiently reduced erosion in the plantation.&lt;/p&gt;'
