  title: The Influence of Poultry Manure-Derived Biochar and Compost on Soil Properties
    and Plant Biomass Growth
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Promising methods for managing poultry manure (PM) include converting\
    \ poultry manure through pyrolysis to biochar, which can be used for soil applications.\
    \ The overall goal of this study was to determine the effects of poultry manure-derived\
    \ biochar and compost on the soil and growth of cherry tomatoes. The biochar obtained\
    \ at 475 \xB0C was characterized by a relatively high organic matter content of\
    \ 39.47% and nitrogen content of 3.73%, while it had the lowest C/N ratio of 8.18.\
    \ According to the recommendations of the EBC, the biochar obtained at 475 \xB0\
    C demonstrated the most beneficial effects in terms of fertilizing potential.\
    \ The composting of poultry manure with the straw was successful, and the limit\
    \ of 60 \xB0C was exceeded, which allowed for the hygienization of the compost.\
    \ The produced compost and biochar are sanitary safe and do not exceed the limits\
    \ of heavy metal content. The lowest plant biomass was obtained from growing medium\
    \ A with 3.6 g wet weight (0.24 g dry weight). The measurements of the height\
    \ of cherry tomatoes showed that growing media D, E, and F allowed the plants\
    \ to obtain from 602 to 654 mm in height.&lt;/p&gt;"
