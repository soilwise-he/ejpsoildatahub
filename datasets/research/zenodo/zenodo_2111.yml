  title: 'Non-steady-state closed dynamic chamber to measure soil CO2 respiration:
    A protocol to reduce uncertainty'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Non-steady-state closed dynamic accumulation chambers are widely
    used to measure the respiration of terrestrial ecosystems, thanks to their low
    cost, low energy consumption and simple transportability, that allow measurements
    even in hostile and remote environments. However, the assessment of the accuracy
    and precision associated with the measurement system (independently of possible
    disturbances due to chamber-soil interactions) is rarely reported. This information
    is instead necessary for basic quality control, to compare data obtained by different
    devices and regression models and to provide Confidence Intervals (CIs) on the
    carbon flux values. This study quantifies the uncertainty associated with emission
    flux measurements, with a focus on very low fluxes. Calibration tests using different
    accumulation chambers and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;sensors were performed,
    and fluxes were calculated by means of different models (parametric, non-parametric
    and flux models). The results of this work show that the linear regression model
    has the best reproducibility when compared to the other tested models, regardless
    of the sensor used and the chamber volumes, while the second order polynomial
    regression has the best accuracy. We remark the importance of building a calibration
    curve in the range of the expected flux values, with an interval between the lowest
    and highest imposed flux that should not exceed two orders of magnitude. To evaluate
    the reproducibility of the measurement, performing replicates for each imposed
    flux value is essential. We also show that it is necessary to carefully identify
    the best time interval for interpolating the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;concentration
    curve in order to guarantee reproducibility and accuracy in flux estimates.&lt;/p&gt;'
