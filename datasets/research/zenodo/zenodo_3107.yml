  title: 'Pocket sized NIR spectrometer coupled to Smart phone for analysis of Rice
    Integrity the case of: Soil health, fertilizer authenticity and grain quality.'
  abstract: "Rice consumption is on the increase world-wide and quality inputs are\
    \ require to aid production. This research seeks to provide a user-friendly and\
    \ reliable onsite analytical tool using a pocket-sized NIR spectrometer coupled\
    \ with smart phone for detecting; soil fertility, fertilizer integrity and rice\
    \ grain authenticity. A total of 110 soil samples from 0-15 cm, 1530 cm and 30-45\
    \ cm layers from the field of different land use cropping systems, 126 fertilizer\
    \ samples from two main types (authentic and expired) and 900 rice samples comprising\
    \ three varieties (Jasmine, Agra and Exbaika) were all collected from different\
    \ locations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract relevant information\
    \ from the spectral data set. The results obtained showed that; SVM had 98.61%\
    \ classification rate of soil from different cropping system. Si-PLS was superior\
    \ in predicting N, P, K, Mg2+, Ca2+ and pH at: 0.571, 0.779, 0.910, 0.778, 0.826\
    \ and 0.904 for Rp2. For the identification of fertilizer authenticity, FD-SVM\
    \ gave 99.20% identification rate. For the quantification of the adulterants in\
    \ fertilizer, Si-PLS was found to be superior and showed an excellent predictive\
    \ potential of Rpre2 = 0.95\u20130.98. For the authentication of rice quality\
    \ grades, the classification rate was 91.62% by SVM while identification rate\
    \ based on country of origin gave 90.84%. For the differentiation of local rice\
    \ from imported ones, KNN had 100%. For the optimum identification of rice from\
    \ country of origin, powdered samples had a better performance compared to rice\
    \ grain, at an accuracy of 98% by using SD-PLSDA. For simultaneous detection of\
    \ rice variety integrity, higher accuracy was found when powdered rice samples\
    \ were used compared to rice grain. The best result was obtained by Si-PLS at\
    \ R2 at 0.94. This study has shown that pocket-sized NIR spectrometer coupled\
    \ with multivariate algorithm and smartphone devices could provide a promising\
    \ tool for sustainable rice production and ensure the integrity and quality of\
    \ soil, fertilizer, variety and avoid adulteration fraud. This tool could be useful\
    \ to soil scientist, breeders, rice farmers, millers, and consumers."
