  title: Nature-Based Solutions for Flood Mitigation and Soil Conservation in a Steep-Slope
    Olive-Orchard Catchment (Arquillos, SE Spain)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The frequency and magnitude of flash floods in the olive orchards
    of southern Spain have increased because of climate change and unsustainable olive-growing
    techniques. Affected surfaces occupy &gt;85% of the rural regions of the Upper
    Guadalquivir Basin. Dangerous geomorphic processes record the increase of runoff,
    soil loss and streamflow through time. We report on ripple/dune growth over a
    plane bed on overland flows, deep incision of ephemeral gullies in olive groves
    and rock-bed erosion in streams, showing an extraordinary sediment transport capacity
    of sub-daily pluvial floods. We develop a novel method to design optimal solutions
    for natural flood management and erosion risk mitigation. We adopt physical-based
    equations and build a whole-system model that accurately reproduces the named
    processes. The approach yields the optimal targeted locations of nature-based
    solutions (NbSs) for active flow-control by choosing the physical-model parameters
    that minimise the peak discharge and the erosion-prone area, maximising the soil
    infiltration capacity. The sub-metric spatial resolution used to resolve microtopographic
    features of terrains/NbS yields a computational mesh with millions of cells, requiring
    a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to run massive numerical simulations. Our study
    could contribute to developing principles and standards for agricultural-management
    initiatives using NbSs in Mediterranean olive and vineyard orchards.&lt;/p&gt;'
