  title: Soil physicochemical properties under eucalyptus tree species planted in
    alley maize cropping agroforestry practice in Decha Woreda, Kaffa zone, southwest
    Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Different studies have shown that the effect of eucalyptus trees
    on soil physicochemical properties is variable, which indicates that more investigations
    that focus on different specific geographical locations and eucalyptus tree species
    are required. The objectives of this study was to evaluate the status of soil
    nutrients under four eucalyptus tree species planted in hedgerow system in comparison
    with that in its adjacent open land. To achieve these objectives, soil samples
    were taken from a soil depth of 0-20 cm from 15-20 spots by using auger and composited
    for respective treatments. Each soil samples analyzed at Teppi soil laboratory
    following standard procedures. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and treatments separation
    were made by using Least Significance Difference (LSD) at 95% probability level.
    The analysis result indicated that there were no significance differences between
    Eucalyptus tree species and its adjacent open land in the level of soil nutrients
    (total N, available P, pH, OM, soil moisture and OC) (p&lt;0.05). The only significant
    difference recorded between Eucalyptus tree species and its adjacent open land
    in the level of sand percentage whereas non-significant difference was noticed
    between the treatments on the level of silt and clay percentage in the study.
    Finally, the results indicate that the eucalyptus tree species established in
    hedgerow system on clay soil in high rainfall area have no significant impact
    on soil physicochemical properties under short rotation period of the tree species.&lt;/p&gt;'
