  title: 'Modeling of Soil Organic Carbon Concentration and Stability Variation in
    Top and Deep Soils with varied Aggregate Size under Climate Change of Sub-tropical
    India: A Review'
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>The effects\
    \ of tillage on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient content of soil aggregates\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally, and for different soil types and cropping\
    \ systems. Surface soil (0\u201315 cm) was fractionated into aggregate sizes (&gt;4.76\
    \ mm, 4.76\u20132.00 mm, 2.00\u20131.00 mm, 1.00\u20130.25 mm, 0.25\u20130.053\
    \ mm, &lt;0.053 mm) under two tillage regimes. The percentage of soil OC mineralized\
    \ (SOC<sub>min</sub>, % SOC) was in general higher in larger aggregates than in\
    \ smaller aggregates. Tillage significantly reduced the proportion of macro-aggregate\
    \ fractions (&gt;2.00 mm) and thus aggregate stability was reduced by 35% compared\
    \ with RNT, indicating that tillage practices led to soil structural change for\
    \ this subtropical soil.</em> <em>Soil organic C decreased with increasing soil\
    \ depth but was greater under tree than others and was mainly concentrated in\
    \ the topsoil layer (0\u201320 cm).</em> <em>In comparison to topsoil, deep soil\
    \ aggregates generally exhibited a lower C<sub>min</sub>, and higher SOC<sub>min</sub>.\
    \ The highest SOC was in the 1.00\u20130.25 mm fraction, while the lowest SOC\
    \ was in micro-aggregate (&lt;0.025 mm) and silt + clay (&lt;0.053 mm) fractions\
    \ and CT, respectively. Tillage did not influence the patterns in SOC across aggregates\
    \ but did change the aggregate-size distribution, indicating that tillage affected\
    \ soil fertility primarily by changing soil structure.</em> <em>The percentage\
    \ of soil OC mineralized (SOC<sub>min</sub>, % SOC) was in general higher in larger\
    \ aggregates than in smaller aggregates. Meanwhile, SOC<sub>min</sub> was greater\
    \ in coniferous forests (CF) than in broad-leaved forests (BF) at topsoil and\
    \ deep soil aggregates. In comparison to topsoil, deep soil aggregates generally\
    \ exhibited a lower C<sub>min</sub>, and higher SOC<sub>min</sub>.</em> <em>The\
    \ sum of macro-aggregate contributing rates for clay-humus stability of soil organic\
    \ C (SOC) was significantly superior to that of the micro-aggregates. Water-stable\
    \ aggregates increased by 34.5% in the CA with residue retention treatment, effectively\
    \ improving the soil structure. Furthermore, 0.25\u20131.00 and 1\u20132mm aggregates\
    \ had the highest SOC microbial biomass storage and responded rapidly to the various\
    \ tillage treatments. Greater proportion of micro-aggregates within macro-aggregates\
    \ in the plots under NT\u2013NT compared with CT\u2013CT was also observed in\
    \ the surface layer only. Plots under NT\u2013NT had about 10% higher coarse (250\u2013\
    2000 \u03BCm) intra-aggregate particulate organic matter-C (iPOM\u2013C) within\
    \ &gt;2000 \u03BCm sand free aggregates in the 0- to 5-cm soil layer compared\
    \ with CT\u2013CT plots. The fine (53\u2013250 \u03BCm) iPOM\u2013C within the\
    \ 250- to 2000-\u03BCm aggregates was also higher in the continuous NT plots compared\
    \ with CT within both &gt;2000 and 250 to 2000 \u03BCm sand free aggregate size\
    \ classes in that soil layer.</em>"
