  title: Utilization of corn stover and pruned Gliricidia sepium biochars as soil

    \ is mainly due to lack of soil organic carbon (SOC). Carbon sequestration (C-seq)\
    \ became a main issue for reducing carbon emission that affect to environment.\
    \ Application of compost and biochar have proven to become a good solution for\
    \ increasing soil quality and carbon storage. This research had been conducted\
    \ in Timor-East Nusa Tenggara Indonesia, aims to understand the effectiveness\
    \ of biochar as soil amelioration on C-sequestration, soil nutrients and maize\
    \ production. Split plot factorial design (type and dosage of biochars) with three\
    \ replications was used to test the hypotheses. The type of biochars were cow\
    \ dung (CD), rice husks (RH), pruned G. sepium (GS) and corn stover (CS) and three\
    \ levels of dosage (D1: 3 t.ha-1; D2: 6 ton.ha-1; and D3: 9 t.ha-1 ). The results\
    \ showed that the GS provided the best effect on the increasing of SOC (2.09%),\
    \ soil nutrient (Ntot 0.22%; P-available 11.34 ppm; K 0.62 me/100g soil), and\
    \ other soil properties (CEC 28.10 me/10 g soil and reducing bulk density to 1.10\
    \ cm-3). It means GS could provide about 68.64 ton.ha-1 C-seq that still remained\
    \ in the soil for the next cro GS or long time utilizations. Not only long term,\
    \ this study also suggested that GS benefited for maize production (maize gain\
    \ 5.88 t ha-1) at short term application. Although statically GS gave similar\
    \ performance to MS but they are better than other tested biochars. As other previous\
    \ studies, increasing the dosage of organic matter might affect to the increasing\
    \ of soil quality and crop production.\n\n<em><strong>International Journal of\
