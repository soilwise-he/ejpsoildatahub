  title: Global maps of potential and climatic plant-available soil water
  abstract: 'The potential plant-available soil water is the difference between wilting
    point and field capacity (FC). Soil water content at FC is estimated using the
    approach developed by Assouline and Or (2014) that considers a dynamic definition
    of FC based on soil-specific matric potential values beyond which the soil water
    continuity is substantially reduced or disrupted. For calculations of soil water
    content at FC we use the van Genuchten soil water characteristic curves from Gupta
    et al., (2022). Furthermore, we introduce the climatic plant-available soil water
    that considers potential evaporation and the average number of consecutive dry
    days between rainfall events. The consecutive dry days were obtained from Bickel
    and Or (2021). This repository contains four global maps at 1km resolution per
    1m soil depth: matric potential at FC [m] water content at FC [m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>]
