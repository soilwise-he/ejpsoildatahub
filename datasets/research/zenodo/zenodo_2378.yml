  title: An Assessment Of Spatial Variations Of Some Soil Properties Under Different
    Land Uses In South-Western Nigeria
  abstract: "Land use and soil management affect the distribution of soil properties\
    \ thereby resulting in changes in the fertility status. Soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties on the surface (0-30 cm) of five land uses (cassava/maize, oil palm,\
    \ cowpea, secondary forest and building site) on a sandy loam Alfisol (Typic paleudalf)\
    \ were assessed for spatial variations. All the land uses differed significantly\
    \ (P&lt;0.01) from each other in at least three properties. Cassava/maize intercrop\
    \ and secondary forest differed in thirteen properties; cassava/maize and oil\
    \ palm in seven and cassava/maize and cowpea in five indicating differential removal\
    \ variability among land use types. In terms of number of soil properties with\
    \ high variability (CV &gt; 35%), the order was cassava/maize (1), oil palm (2),\
    \ building site (5) &gt; secondary forest (4) &gt; cowpea (3). The study established\
    \ that different land uses influence the soil differently within the same soil\
    \ class. Therefore, this must be taken into consideration in order to reduce soil\
    \ fertility decline and enhance proper soil management. There must therefore,\
    \ be a careful choice of appropriate use of land if we are to optimise production\
    \ since loss of soil and fertility status may be difficult to replace in one\u2019\
    s lifetime."
