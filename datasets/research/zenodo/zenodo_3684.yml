  title: The thermal response of soil microbial methanogenesis decreases in magnitude
    with changing temperature
  abstract: "Microbial methanogenesis in anaerobic soils contributes greatly to global\
    \ methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) release, and understanding its response to temperature\
    \ is fundamental to predicting the feedback between this potent greenhouse gas\
    \ and climate change. A compensatory thermal response in microbial activity over\
    \ time can reduce the response of respiratory carbon (C) release to temperature\
    \ change, as shown for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in aerobic soils. However,\
    \ whether microbial methanogenesis also shows a compensatory response to temperature\
    \ change remains unknown. Here, we used anaerobic wetland soils from the Greater\
    \ Khingan Range and the Tibetan Plateau to investigate how 160 days of experimental\
    \ warming (+4\xB0C) and cooling (-4\xB0C) affect the thermal response of microbial\
    \ CH<sub>4</sub> respiration and whether these responses correspond to changes\
    \ in microbial community dynamics. The mass-specific CH<sub>4</sub> respiration\
    \ rates of methanogens decreased with warming and increased with cooling, suggesting\
    \ that microbial methanogenesis exhibited compensatory responses to temperature\
    \ changes. Furthermore, changes in the species composition of methanogenic community\
    \ under warming and cooling largely explained the compensatory response in the\
    \ soils. The stimulatory effect of climate warming on soil microbe-driven CH<sub>4</sub>\
    \ emissions may thus be smaller than that currently predicted, with important\
    \ consequences for atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations."
