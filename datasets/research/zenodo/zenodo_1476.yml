  title: Effect of Fly ash & Microbes on Strength properties of Subgrade soil for
    Pavements
  abstract: 'Abstract: This work investigates the utilization of microbial-induced
    calcite precipitation (MICP) treatment to improve the stability of soil by introducing
    Class F fly ash and Bacillus subtilis microbes. Various experiments were carried
    out using soil that was readily available in the vicinity area. The primary tasks
    consisted of mixing fly ash and subsequently utilizing varying quantities of fly-ash.
    The experiment involved the incorporation of fly ash at varying ratios, specifically
    5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%.The soil''s characteristics are influenced by
    the presence of fly ash, as evidenced by the following tests: reduction in liquid
    limit, increase in UCC and CBR values, analysis of soil compaction under high
    pressure, measurement of unconfined compressive strength (UCC) at various time
    intervals (0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days), and assessment of California bearing ratio
    (CBR) for soil samples with varying amounts of fly ash. The most favorable results
    are obtained by integrating 25% fly ash into the soil, surpassing all other quantities.
    Following the introduction of Bacillus subtilis C4nc8 bacteria, the OMC is blended
    with a mixture consisting of 25% fly ash and soil. In addition, it is shown that
    the optimal values for CBR (2.2 times higher than that of soil) and UCC (6.5 times
    higher than that of pure soil) are attained by blending soil with 25% fly ash
    and microorganisms. Ultimately, the addition of soil, 25% fly ash, and microorganisms
    has been discovered to significantly improve the CBR strength of the subgrade.
