  title: Analysis Of A Frame-Shear Wall Concrete Structure By Using Base Isolation
    And Evaluation Of Structure-Soil Interaction
  abstract: "A base isolation system is a type of earthquake-resistant structure design\
    \ approach based on the principle of reducing a structure\u2019s earthquake response\
    \ rather than increasing the structure\u2019s earthquake resistance capacity.\
    \ Seismic base isolated structures have the ability to make large displacements\
    \ relative to the level of insulation elements. This means that a large structure\
    \ performs very small displacements between floors during an earthquake and exhibits\
    \ a rigid body behavior. At this point, the earthquake forces acting on the structure\
    \ decrease along with the floors. In this article a school building composed of\
    \ frame-shear wall is resolved primarily with the traditional fixed base structure\
    \ system, mode shapes are found and periods are obtained. For earthquake response\
    \ analysis, earthquake loads are distributed to the floors using the equivalent\
    \ seismic load method and structural elements experiencing capacity problems are\
    \ found. Then, using the earthquake record, larger failure of cross sections and\
    \ capacity problems are obtained compared to the first method. In the second stage,\
    \ the same structure is dissolved again by placing the lead core rubber base isolators\
    \ between the base and the vertical structural members. The periods of structures\
    \ under earthquake load have increased significantly by utilizing base isolation,\
    \ as a result of that spectral accelerations decreased. Thus, large decreases\
    \ in the shear forces acting to the structure are determined and failures of cross\
    \ sections are removed."
