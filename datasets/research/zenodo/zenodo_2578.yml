  title: 'Effect of Vegetation Hydromechanics on Soil Reinforcement on Hillsides as
    Prevention of Shallow Landslides: A Systematic Literature Review'
  abstract: 'The landslides phenomenon due to rainfall is a global hazard that causes
    damage to infrastructure and the

    ecological environment, economic losses, and endangers human life. This incidence
    tends to increase

    every year due to the effects of climate change and land use. Landslides caused
    by these rainfalls

    commonly occur in mountainous environments around the world. This is usually triggered
    by a decrease in

    the shear strength of the soil after an intense heavy rain event. Therefore, it
    is necessary to implement

    priority mitigation and remediation measures. The vegetative method has proven
    to be an effective

    landslide mitigation measure, as it increases the shear strength of the soil through
    a series of mechanical

    and hydrological effects. Many reviews of the mechanical and hydrological role
    of vegetation in slope

    stability have been carried out over the decades because the installation of vegetation
    on slopes has been

    widely recognized as an environmentally friendly, low cost, and sustainable engineering
    method. This

    systematic literature review uses the Web of science and Science Direct as databases
    to store and analyze

    existing research on the hydromechanical role of vegetation on slope stability,
    particularly shallow

    landslides. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated picture for the
    period 2016 to 2021 to

    determine the relationship between the presence of plant roots and the quality
    of soil mechanical properties

    and the relationship between rainfall and soil hydrological properties that can
    affect slope stability. The

    results of this study can be used as a reference for further researchers in developing
    research related to the

    topic of slope stability using the vegetative method.'
