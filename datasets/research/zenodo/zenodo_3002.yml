  title: 'NITIAL RESULTS OF COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SOIL EROSION INTENSITY USING
    THE WIntErO MODEL: A CASE STUDY OF POLIMLJE AND SHIRINDAREH DRAINAGE BASINS'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;This\
    \ work aims to determine the current state of sediment production and propose\
    \ land use measures that will affect the reducing the intensity of soil erosion\
    \ for the areas of the Polimlje drainage basin on the territories of Montenegro\
    \ and Serbia, and the small Shirindareh sub-basin of Iran. The approach is based\
    \ on field and laboratory methods, which are processed by Web-based Intensity\
    \ of Erosion and Outflow (WIntErO)model used to calculate erosion intensity. By\
    \ using the computer-graphical method of the &quot;WIntErO&quot; software, in\
    \ the study of erosion intensity, surface values (watershed surface, surface between\
    \ isohypsies, etc.) and length, i.e. deviations from the map (length of the main\
    \ watercourse, length of the watershed line, etc.) is processed very precisely,\
    \ which was not the case before when using mechanical instruments, planimeters\
    \ and curvimeters. The new WIntErO model is an integrated computer-graphic program\
    \ package of the third-generation method based on the earlier generations of the\
    \ modelling tools &quot;River basins&quot;, and IntErO and calculates the amount\
    \ of sediment, the intensity of soil erosion, as well as the maximum runoff from\
    \ the basin, according to the EPM model of Gavrilovi\u0107.During the procedure,\
    \ an accuracy assessment is conducted with measurements of reservoir sediment\
    \ deposition. These measurements were performed in April 2017 using professional\
    \ hydrographic recording equipment, following the same methodology as in 2012.\
    \ The measurement of point locations was conducted using a GPS receiver and a\
    \ Trimble R6 base station. The reservoir&#39;s depth was measured using a single-frequency\
    \ portable echo sounder, specifically the Odom Hydro Track. The initial assessment\
    \ shows fairly acceptable results of the implemented WIntErO modelling for both\
    \ study areas. Z coefficient values ranging from 0.01 to 1.00 for the observed\
    \ period indicate that the river basins delineate areas with varying levels of\
    \ susceptibility to water erosion processes&mdash;ranging from very low to moderate\
    \ and high risk&mdash;within the studied drainage basins. Based on the analysis,\
    \ we found that the average erosion intensity in Polimlje is 331.78 m&sup3; km\u207B\
    &sup2; year\u207B&sup1; per square kilometer. For the Shirindareh sub-basins,\
    \ the average actual soil losses per square kilometer are 201 m&sup3; year\u207B\
    &sup1; km\u207B&sup2;. Given these findings, it is evident that these basins require\
    \ prompt implementation of soil conservation measures&lt;/p&gt;"
