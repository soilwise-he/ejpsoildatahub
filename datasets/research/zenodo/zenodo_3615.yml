  title: Lead In The Soil-Plant System Following Aged Contamination From Ceramic Wastes
  abstract: Lead contamination of agricultural land mainly vegetated with perennial
    ryegrass (<em>Lolium perenne</em>) has been investigated. The metal derived from
    the discharge of sludge from a ceramic industry in the past had used lead paints.
    The results showed very high values of lead concentration in many soil samples.
    In order to assess the lead soil contamination, a sequential extraction with H<sub>2</sub>O,
    KNO<sub>3</sub>, EDTA was performed, and the chemical forms of lead in the soil
    were evaluated. More than 70% of lead was in a potentially bioavailable form.
    Analysis of <em>Lolium perenne</em> showed elevated lead concentration. A Freundlich-like
    model was used to describe the transferability of the metal from the soil to the
    plant.
