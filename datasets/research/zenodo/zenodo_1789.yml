  title: Investigation of the toxic effects of herbicides on some selected microbial
    populations from soil
  abstract: The toxic effect of herbicide on some selected microbial populations from
    soil was investigated. Soil samples were collected from two unpolluted designated
    fields of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University and later polluted with herbicides
    at different application rates (0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.5 %, 1 % and 5 %) and periods
    using spraying method. Standard chemical processes were used for determining physico-chemical
    parameters of the soil while isolation, enumerating the population of the microorganisms
    and identification of the isolates were determined using standard microbiological
    methods. The result revealed that the soil samples are slightly acidic, sandy
    clay loam type, lower organic carbon content, higher total nitrogen and phosphorus
    contents and moderate water holding capacity. The isolates <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
    Bacillus vallismottis, Aeromonas hydrophila </em>and<em> Enterobacter clocea </em>were
    selected using selective media and identified. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>and
    <em>Bacillus vallismottis </em>had the least (zero CFU/g) and maximum population
    counts (10 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/g) during glyphosate exposure while <em>Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa </em>and <em>Enterobacter clocea </em>had the least (zero CFU/g) and
    maximum population counts (2.50 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/g) during 2, 4 - D amine
    exposure for 15 days, respectively. Thus, the application of glyphosate and 2,
    4 - D amine herbicides on the soil have resulted into lower counts of the selected
    microbial groups. The inhibitions of their growths are dependent on concentration
    and exposure period, although 2, 4 - D amine had more inhibition than the glyphosate
    herbicide.
