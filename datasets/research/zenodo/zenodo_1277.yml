  title: Assessment of Soil Degradation in Sitio Marulay, Lunga, Valencia, Negros
    Oriental, Philippines
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> This study determined the extent of soil degradation
    in Sitio Marulay, Valencia, Negros Oriental. Biophysical and socio-economic factors
    were assessed consisting of topography, climate, soil, vegetation, population,
    migration, livelihood, income and farming practices. Factors that have significant
    impact on the soil quality were identified to determine the extent and severity
    of soil degradation brought about by its present land-use using a set of criteria
    described as low, moderate, severe and highly severe. Sitio Marulay is an upland
    area with a slope of 30-50% . From 2003 to 2007, the monthly average rainfall
    was 104 mm while the annual average rainfall was 1,216 mm. During the months of
    June to December, rainfall was higher ranging from 103-189 mm with subsequent
    water runoff. The clay-textured soil in Sitio Marulay can be considered as moderately
    erodible with acidic soil pH on steeper slope. This indicates that erosion is
    taking place. There was minimal vegetation on gently sloping land situated at
    higher elevation since the area has been cleared for farming. In contrast, clusters
    of mahogany trees were found along steep slopes that were established to mitigate
    soil erosion and landslides. However, some steep areas were severely eroded due
    to lack of vegetation. A total of four (4) families residing in the area as well
    as other land speculators primarily used Sitio Marulay for agriculture. The farmers
    rarely practiced soil and water conservation methods except planting trees on
    steep slopes to prevent soil erosion. The population in Sitio Marulay is expected
    to increase after barangay officials in Lunga have sttled the issue on land claims.
    Consequently, farming activities will also intensify to meet the demands for food
    as settlement increases. Considering all factors that contribute to soil degradation,
    such as amount of rainfall, type of soil, slope, vegetation, population, farming
    practices and land-use, the extent and severity of soil degradation in Sitio Marulay
    can be considered as moderate. As a guide to environmental resource managers of
    Sitio Marulay, vegetative and cultural methods of soil and water conservation
    such as contour hedgerows, multi-storey cropping, use of organic fertilizers,
    crop rotation and establishment of mini-storey on steep slopes are highly recommended.
    This is to improve soil quality and minimize soil degradation.
