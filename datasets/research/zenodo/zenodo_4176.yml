  title: Contamination Of Organochlorine Pesticides In Nest Soil, Egg, And Blood Of
    The Snail-Eating Turtle (Malayemys Macrocephala) From The Chao Phraya River Basin,
    Thailand
  abstract: "Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are known to be\npersistent and bioaccumulative\
    \ toxicants that may cause reproductive\nimpairments in wildlife as well as human.\
    \ The current study uses the\nsnail-eating turtle Malayemys macrocephala, a long-lived\
    \ animal\ncommonly distribute in rice field habitat in central part of Thailand,\n\
    as a sentinel to monitor OCP contamination in environment. The\nnest soil, complete\
    \ clutch of eggs, and blood of the turtle were\ncollected from agricultural areas\
    \ in the Chao Phraya River Basin,\nThailand during the nesting season of 2007-2008.\
    \ The novel\nmethods for tissue extraction by an accelerated solvent extractor\n\
    (ASE, for egg) and liquid-liquid extraction (for blood) have been\ndeveloped.\
    \ The nineteen OCP residues were analyzed by gas\nchromatography with micro-electron\
    \ captured detector (GC-\u03BCECD).\nThe validated methods have met requirements\
    \ of the AOAC\nstandard. The results indicated that significant amounts of OCPs\
    \ are\nstill contaminated in nest soil and eggs of the turtle even though the\n\
    OCPs had been banned in this area for many years. This suggested\nthe potential\
    \ risk to health of wildlife as well as human in the area."
