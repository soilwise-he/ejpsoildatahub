  title: Chemical, thermal and mineralogical characteristics of concretes in stabilized
    soil with sugar cane molasses
  abstract: "Abstract This paper scrutinizes MEDDRX, TGA, IR, DTA\u2019s analyses\
    \ performed on stabilized soil concrete with sugar cane molasses. It is important\
    \ to underline that the soil remains the principal material in house construction\
    \ in the Republic of the Congo. The use of sugar cane molasses as a stabilizing\
    \ to bricks and soil roads appears as an alternative solution to valorise this\
    \ agro-industrial by-product; moreover, sugar cane molasses has led to obtain\
    \ soil-made materials with highly enhanced mechanical properties. Therefore, this\
    \ study has enabled to determine the evolution of induced structure by the presence\
    \ of molasses within the soil matrix. As a consequence, the final results clearly\
    \ indicate that the molasses brings no alteration to kaolinite\u2019s structure.\
    \ However, molasses spreads on basal and lateral surface of clay, and sugar groupings\
    \ establish physical interactions with silanol and aluminol groupings of clay\u2019\
    s external surface. Thereby, the interaction between molasses and clay of soil\
    \ is essentially physical. Molasses\u2019 presence within stabilized soil matrix\
    \ is ascertained by the appearance of thermal peaks attributed to sucrose pyrolysis,\
    \ whereas the appearance of absorption bands is attributed to aromatic compounds\
    \ responsible of the colouring. The thermal decomposition of stabilized soil with\
    \ molasses takes place following four thermal peaks: 150-200 \xB0C, 300 \xB0C,\
    \ 480-500 \xB0C, and 700 \xB0C."
