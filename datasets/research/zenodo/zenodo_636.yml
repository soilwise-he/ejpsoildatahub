  title: Global Evaluation of SMAP/Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Products
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture is the latest SMAP (Soil Moisture
    Active Passive) product derived from synergistic utilization of the radiometry
    observations of SMAP and radar backscattering data of Sentinel-1. This product
    is the first and only global soil moisture (SM) map at 1 km and 3 km spatial resolutions.
    In this paper, we evaluated the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SM product from different viewpoints
    to better understand its quality, advantages, and likely limitations. A comparative
    analysis of this product and in situ measurements, for the time period March 2015
    to January 2022, from 35 dense and sparse SM networks and 561 stations distributed
    around the world was carried out. We examined the effects of land cover, vegetation
    fraction, water bodies, urban areas, soil characteristics, and seasonal climatic
    conditions on the performance of active&ndash;passive SMAP/Sentinel-1 in estimating
    the SM. We also compared the performance metrics of enhanced SMAP (9 km) and SMAP/Sentinel-1
    products (3 km) to analyze the effects of the active&ndash;passive disaggregation
    algorithm on various features of the SMAP SM maps. Results showed satisfactory
    agreement between SMAP/Sentinel-1 and in situ SM measurements for most sites (r
    values between 0.19 and 0.95 and ub-RMSE between 0.03 and 0.17), especially for
    dense sites without representativeness errors. Thanks to the vegetation effect
    correction applied in the active&ndash;passive algorithm, the SMAP/Sentinel-1
    product had the highest correlation with the reference data in grasslands and
    croplands. Results also showed that the accuracy of the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SM product
    in different networks is independent of the presence of water bodies, urban areas,
    and soil types. &copy; 2022 by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;'
