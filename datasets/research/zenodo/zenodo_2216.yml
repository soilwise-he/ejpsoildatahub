  title: Soil Salinity Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms with the Sentinel-2
    MSI in Arid Areas, China
  abstract: "Accurate monitoring of soil salinization plays a key role in the ecological\
    \ security and sustainable agricultural development of arid regions. As a branch\
    \ of artificial intelligence, machine learning acquires new knowledge through\
    \ self-learning and continuously improves its own performance. The purpose of\
    \ this study is to combine Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data and MSI-derived\
    \ covariates with measured soil salinity data and to apply three machine learning\
    \ algorithms in modeling to estimate and map the soil salinity in the study sample\
    \ area. According to the convenient transportation conditions, the study area\
    \ and sampling quadrat were set up, and the 5-point method was used to collect\
    \ the soil mixed samples, and 160 soil mixed samples were collected. Kennard\u2013\
    Stone (K\u2013S) algorithm was used for sample classification, 70% for modeling\
    \ and 30% for verification. The machine learning algorithm uses Support Vector\
    \ Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). The\
    \ results showed that (1) the average reflectance of each band of the MSI data\
    \ ranged from 0.21\u20130.28. According to the spectral characteristics corresponding\
    \ to different soil electrical conductivity (EC) levels (1.07\u201379.6 dS m<sup>\u2212\
    1</sup> ), the spectral reflectance of salinized soil in the MSI data ranged from\
    \ 0.09\u20130.35. (2) The correlation coefficient between the MSI data and MSI-derived\
    \ covariates and soil EC was moderate, and the correlation between certain MSI\
    \ data sets and soil EC was not significant. (3) The SVM soil EC estimation model\
    \ established with the MSI data set attained a higher performance and accuracy\
    \ (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.89 dS m<sup>\u2212\
    1</sup> , and ratio of the performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ) = 1.96,\
    \ standard error of the laboratory measurements to the standard error of the predictions\
    \ (SEL/SEP) = 1.11) than those attained with the soil EC estimation models established\
    \ with the RF and ANN models. (4) We applied the SVM soil EC estimation model\
    \ to map the soil salinity in the study area, which showed that the farmland with\
    \ higher altitudes discharged a large amount of salt to the surroundings due to\
    \ long-term irrigation, and the secondary salinization of the farmland also caused\
    \ a large amount of salt accumulation. This research provides a scientific basis\
    \ for the simulation of soil salinization scenarios in arid areas in the future."
