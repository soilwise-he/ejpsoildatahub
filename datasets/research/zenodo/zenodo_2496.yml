  title: Transfer of natural radionuclides from soil to Centella asiatica, a medicinal
    plant grown in Colombo district, Sri Lanka
  abstract: "Natural radionuclides are taken up by the herbs from the environment\
    \ and are accumulated in<br> varied concentrations in different parts of the plant.\
    \ Therefore, it is considered as a type of<br> contaminant in herbal medicines,\
    \ which may harm consumers by long term usage. Centella<br> asiatica (L) Urban\
    \ is a weedy plant grown in Sri Lanka, which is widely used in folk medicine<br>\
    \ and also routinely consumed as a green leafy vegetable by the majority of the\
    \ population. The<br> objective of the present study is to determine the transfer\
    \ of natural radionuclides from soil to<br> C. asiatica grown in Colombo district\
    \ and assess the safety level of routine consumption. The<br> plant and surface\
    \ soil samples were collected from 10 different locations within Colombo<br> district\
    \ from where the samples are mainly supplied to local markets. The activity of<br>\
    \ radionuclides were determined by analysing gamma spectroscopy obtained using\
    \ HPGe<br> detector. The average activity concentration of <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>232</sup>Th\
    \ and <sup>40</sup>K in the plants were 116 \xB1<br> 38 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>,115\
    \ \xB1 38 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> and 1108 \xB1 298 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> respectively.\
    \ The average soil to plant<br> transfer factor of 238U, <sup>232</sup>Th and\
    \ <sup>40</sup>K were 0.5, 0.4 and 15 respectively. The threshold<br> consumption\
    \ rates for plant samples were ranged from 1 to 28 kg yr<sup>-1</sup>. The calculated\
    \ average<br> committed effective dose for annual intake of the C. asiatica samples\
    \ was 0.1 mSv yr<sup>-1</sup>, while<br> the world average annual effective dose\
    \ is reported as 0.3 mSv yr<sup>-1</sup>. The results of the present<br> study\
    \ suggest, that the routine usage of C. asiatica as a medicinal plant as well\
    \ as an edible<br> plant is safe in terms of the radiological health hazards.<br>"
