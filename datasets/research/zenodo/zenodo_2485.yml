  title: Initial impact of a soil disturbance technique (disc harrowing) on Orthoptera
    in a grass heath in Breckland, UK
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;On a Breckland grass heath in eastern England, soil disturbance
    methods such as disc harrowing employed to benefit endangered plants such as tower
    mustard, Arabis glabra, could also create exposed ground for localized insects,
    specifically the mottled grasshopper, Myrmeleotettix maculatus. Orthoptera of
    disc-harrowed strips on a grass heath at Santon Warren in Norfolk, UK, were monitored
    in 2018 and 2019. Data analysis focused on two target species, field grasshopper,
    Chorthippus brunneus, and M. maculatus, which are likely to respond positively
    to the creation of early successional habitat. Of the two species, M. maculatus
    was found in significantly high abundance on the disc-harrowed strips, whereas
    C. brunneus was not. The species richness of Orthoptera did not appear affected
    by harrowing, although three species at this location (lesser marsh grasshopper,
    Chorthippus albomarginatus, long-winged conehead, Conocephalus fuscus, and Roesel''s
    bush-cricket, Roseliana roeselii) need taller vegetation than was present on the
    disc-harrowed strips.&lt;/p&gt;'
