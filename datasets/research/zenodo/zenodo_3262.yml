  title: 'Above- and Belowground Plant Production and Community structure in a mesic
    semi-natural grassland: Moderate variation in soil texture has a much stronger
    influence than long term Experimentally Increased Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition'
  abstract: "Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition derived from agricultural intensification\
    \ and fossil fuel burning can significantly impact plant growth, species diversity,\
    \ and nutrient cycling. Semi-natural grasslands are of particular concern because\
    \ of their global abundance, relatively low intensity agricultural management,\
    \ and consequently high plant and animal species diversity. However, the long-term\
    \ consequences of enhanced atmospheric N deposition on semi-natural grasslands\
    \ are difficult to predict because their responses to increased low-level N availability\
    \ may be strongly influenced by factors such as soil texture that have not been\
    \ investigated. Here, we investigated the impacts of 16 years of experimental\
    \ N addition (simulating 2050 atmospheric N input rates) to a hayfield of varying\
    \ loamy soil texture (clay-loam \u2013 sandy-loam) on plant community structure\
    \ and above-and belowground biomass. The chronic low-level N addition treatment\
    \ had no significant effects, while species richness, diversity, and aboveground\
    \ growth were best explained by variation in soil water-filled pore space and\
    \ were substantially larger on those plots with clay-rich soil texture.\_ The\
    \ consistent lack of responses to the low-level N additions, as well as the lack\
    \ of a growth response to a separate single year\u2019s factorial high-level N\
    \ and phosphorus addition experiment, indicate that future atmospheric N deposition\
    \ increases are unlikely to have major impacts on Ontario\u2019s hayfields. By\
    \ contrast, the strong interconnected influences of soil clay content and water\
    \ availability in our results suggest that texture variation \u2013 even within\
    \ loamy soils - will be a primary determinant of the impacts of anticipated future\
    \ summer warming and reduced rainfall on hayfield vegetation."
