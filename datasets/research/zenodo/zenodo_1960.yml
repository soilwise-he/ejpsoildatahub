  title: A Review of Failure Mechanism of Pile-supported Structures due to Earthquake
    Induced Soil Liquefaction
  abstract: The paper reviews the failure mechanism of pile-supported structures in
    liquefiable soil during earthquakes. Post earthquake investigation of many pile-supported
    structures on liquefiable soil shows that despite the large factor of safety against
    bending due to lateral loads employed in their design, structures failed, e.g.
    failure of firehouse building at Kobe Port in 1995, Japan. It has also been observed
    that the middle piers of the bridges collapsed without significantly affecting
    the other parts. A number of experiments conducted by various investigators highlighted
    the importance of pile failure modes other than bending mechanism, especially,
    pile failure due to buckling. The initial codes of practice for pile design on
    liquefiable soils such as NEHRP 2000, Eurocode 8, JRA1996, and IS1893 focused
    only on bending failure, and failure due to buckling/dynamic amplification of
    pile due to the axial loading during liquefaction was neglected.
