    has recently become extremely popular as the urgency of addressing global warming
    increases. Since it takes into account issues with energy efficiency, health and
    safety, recycling, renewable resources, and many other aspects. Green technology
    is ecologically friendly also. To achieve sustainable development goals, green
    technology broadens the range of available options and potential strategies while
    gradually lowering the costs of their implementation. Green products are those
    that protect the environment also. More the implementation of Green technology
    more the sustainability goals can be achieved. On the daily basis, waste material
    is a problem for disposal. It is very much difficult to dispose the waste material
    effectively. Hence, the negative impact on the environment is effectively reduced
    when waste material is used in the stabilization of weak soil during building/road
    construction. In the present days, application of solid waste materials in soil
    strengthening is a great effective means to utilize it, generated from different
    sources. As underlying soil is bearing load from the superstructure, vehicles,
    the stability of soft soil is very important. Soil strengthening is required for
    soft soil as it possess very low shear strength and CBR. The strengthening of
    soil enhances bearing capacity, reduces settlement, helps to reduce liquefaction
    effect of soil and also ground water contamination. Soil strengthening is the
    method of improving the engineering properties of soil by utilizing the stabilizers
    to enhance the load bearing capacity as well as resistance to weathering. When
    the different types of stabilizing agents are mixed with pozzolanic materials
    and water, after reaction (may be after alkali activation), it forms a harder
    composite without using conventional cement, lime etc. The present paperdeals
    with how the soil strengthening can be done by utilizing the waste materials for
    different sources like industrial and agricultural waste. The different types
    of waste materials are fly ash, bagasse ash, Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag,
    coir fibers, rice-husk ash, etc. This paper will highlight different aspects of
    soil strengthening, engineering properties like bearing capacity, permeability,
    shear strength, CBR etc., which are improved to a great extent. It may be noted
    here that use of conventional cement /lime can be totally avoided for weak soil
    from the consideration of Green technology and waste management as mentioned above.'
