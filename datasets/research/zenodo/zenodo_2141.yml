  title: Comparative Characteristics Of The Structures Of Soil Cover On The Western
    And Eastern Parts Of Absheron
  abstract: "A comparative description of the Absheron area with the use of previously\
    \ collected material and data obtained from field studies was carried out. Field\
    \ soil and laboratory and laboratory studies were conducted on Absheron. The relief\
    \ plastics method has identified several types of soil cover structures and determined\
    \ their soil composition. Based on the research, 11 types of soil cover structures\
    \ were identified. In conclusion, the authors conclude that it is possible to\
    \ prevent the waterlogging of Absheron\u2019s soils only if the groundwater level\
    \ drops below the critical level. The solution for these purposes could be the\
    \ construction of drainage. But given the complexity of the soil-meliorative state\
    \ of Absheron, the physical\u2013geographical conditions, the diversity of the\
    \ relief, it is not possible to recommend a single collector\u2013drainage system\
    \ for the entire array. In some places, temporary open drainage can be built to\
    \ lower the level of groundwater. It can be very local."
