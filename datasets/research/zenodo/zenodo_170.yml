  title: District wise soil fertility mapping from Soil Health Card data using GIS
    in Meghalaya
  abstract: Soil fertility maps, namely soil acidity, salinity, organic carbon, available
    phosphorus, and potassium were generated using Geographic Information System from
    grid-wise soil health data collected from SHC Portal. The study revealed that
    soils of all districts of Meghalaya are non-saline. The soils of all districts
    of the State (except two districts of Jaintia hills ) are mostly slightly acidic
    with the highest area in West Garo Hills and South West Garo Hills that cover
    the entire districts whereas the moderately acidic soils are more abundant in
    East Jaintia Hills and West Jaintia Hills districts that cover 97.06% and 85.56%
    area respectively. The strongly acidic and neutral soils are found in very negligible
    areas. All districts of Jaintia Hills and Khasi hills are rich in organic carbon
    covering 99% area. More than 54% of areas of the districts of Meghalaya have medium
    available phosphorus and the highest area is found in North Garo hills (91%).
    Available phosphorus is high in 35% of soils of East Khasi hills followed by South
    West Khasi Hills (19.89%) and West Khasi Hills (16.12%) district. Availability
    of potassium is low in &gt;66% areas of 6 districts (South West Khasi Hills and
    all five districts of Garo hills) whereas &gt; 52% areas of 5 district of Jaintia
    Hills and Khasi hills (except South West Khasi hills) are medium in available
    potassium. Soils of Ri-bhoi, East Jaintia Hills, West Khasi Hills, and East Khasi
    Hills districts contain high available potassium covering 19.91%, 17.76%, 10.97%,
    and 7.54% area, respectively.
