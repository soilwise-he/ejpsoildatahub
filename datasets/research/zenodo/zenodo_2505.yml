  title: 'Investigation into Some of Engineering Properties of Soil: A Case in Study
    in Seka Town, Jimma Zone, Ethiopia'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The main aim of this study is to investigate some of the engineering
    properties of soils found in Seka town in order to know the nature of the soil
    and also to give information for the design, construction and environmental assessment,
    so that suitable foundation can be recommended for better design and construction
    in the town. Laboratory tests were carried out including specific gravity ranges
    2.65 to 2.77, natural moisture content, Atterberg limits, UCS&nbsp; ranges 143.52kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;to
    352.92kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, compression index 0.23 and 0.39, and swelling
    index 0.19 and 0.02, MDD ranges from 1.180 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;to
    1.480 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and OMC range 35.9% to 48.00% and permeability
    ranges 3.75*10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;to 2.75*10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;cm/sec.
    Based on the results of this study, the grain size distribution indicates all
    soil samples have more than 90% fine grained material. Clayey silty type of soil
    is dominantly located in the study area.&lt;/p&gt;'
