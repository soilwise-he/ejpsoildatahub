  title: "Pathways regulating decreased soil respiration with warming in a biocrust\u2010\
    dominated dryland"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A positive soil carbon (C)&minus;climate feedback is embedded
    into the climatic models of the IPCC. However, recent global syntheses indicate
    that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)
    in drylands, the largest biome on Earth, is actually lower in warmed than in control
    plots. Consequently, soil C losses with future warming are expected to be low
    compared with other biomes. Nevertheless, the empirical basis for these global
    extrapolations is still poor in drylands, due to the low number of field experiments
    testing the pathways behind the long-term responses of soil respiration (R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;)
    to warming. Importantly, global drylands are covered with biocrusts (communities
    formed by bryophytes, lichens, cyanobacteria, fungi and bacteria), and thus R&lt;sub&gt;S
    &lt;/sub&gt;responses to warming may be driven by both autotrophic and heterotrophic
    pathways. Here, we evaluated the effects of eight-years experimental warming on
    R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, and the different pathways involved&lt;sub&gt;, &lt;/sub&gt;in
    a biocrust-dominated dryland in southern Spain. We also assessed the overall impacts
    on soil organic C (SOC) accumulation over time. Across the years and biocrust
    cover levels, warming reduced R&lt;sub&gt;S &lt;/sub&gt;by 0.30 &micro;mol CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;(95 % CI = &minus;0.24 to
    0.84), although the negative warming effects were only significant after three
    years of elevated temperatures in areas with low initial biocrust cover. We found
    support for different pathways regulating the warming-induced reduction in R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
    at areas with low (microbial thermal acclimation via reduced soil mass-specific
    respiration and &beta;-glucosidase enzymatic activity) vs. high (microbial thermal
    acclimation jointly with a reduction in autotrophic respiration from decreased
    lichen cover) initial biocrust cover. Our eight-year experimental study shows
    a reduction in soil respiration with warming, and highlights that biocrusts should
    be explicitly included in modelling efforts aimed to quantify the soil C&minus;climate
    feedback in drylands.&lt;/p&gt;'
