  title: Investigation of temperature gradient between ambient air and  soil to power
    up wireless sensor network device using a  thermoelectric generator
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a study of an energy harvesting system for\
    \ powering wireless sensor network (WSN) devices. The thermal energy harvesting\
    \ system used is based on the thermal energy source between ambient air at the\
    \ soil surface with five depth levels. Measurement was taken for 46 days in a\
    \ garden area located in Melaka, Malaysia. A feasibility study of soil temperature\
    \ measurement to obtain a temperature gradient can be used for harvesting by using\
    \ thermoelectric generators (TEG) modules. Then, the efficiency of TEG with several\
    \ different configurations based on temperature gradient data has been tested\
    \ in the laboratory. The results revealed that the depth of soil 6 cm between\
    \ sensors 1 and 3 will gave the best representation of level average temperature\
    \ different around 1 \u2103. Based on the temperature gradient data, the combination\
    \ of three TEG SP1848 in a series connection with DC-DC step-up circuit DC1664\
    \ will produce an optimum voltage output of about 3 V. This output voltage is\
    \ enough to operate low power IoT device derived from thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;"
