  title: Isolation and Antibacterial Activity of Antibiotic-Producing Bacteria Recovered
    from Soil in Kano, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Filamentous soil bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces
    are widely recognized as industrially important micro-organisms for their ability
    to produce secondary metabolites including antibiotics.&nbsp;The present study
    aimed at isolation and determination of antibacterial activity of antibiotic producing
    bacteria recovered from soil in Kano. Forty eight different soil samples were
    collected from Gwarzo, Katsina, Hadejia and Maiduguri roads. Twelve soil samples
    were collected from each of the four different sites and transported to Postgraduate
    Laboratory, Bayero University Kano for physical and microbiological analysis.
    The mean value of soil temperature, pH, moisture content and organic matter obtained
    are 26-27&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C,&nbsp;6.5-7.5, 43.4-46.9%and 18.9-19.8% respectively
    whereas the mean&nbsp;Streptomycetal count obtained is 1.46x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-1.53x&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g.
    The&nbsp;Streptomyces&nbsp;species isolated&nbsp;&nbsp; include: Actinomadura,
    Nocardia, Actinomyces and Streptomyces and were tested against clinical bacterial
    isolates of&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella
    typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;.
    The metabolites extracted and tested were found to be of broad spectrum that inhibited
    the growth of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with zones of inhibition
    up to 31mm. Thin layer chromatography of the extracts ranged from 0.67-0.78&nbsp;Retention
    Factor&nbsp;and infrared spectrum revealed how much functional groups were absorbed
    at each transmittance, the position, shape and intensity of the peaks were analyzed
    in the spectrum.&nbsp;The investigation demonstrate that strains of antibiotic-producing
    bacteria are present in the soil of Kano Metropolis, Nigeria and these could be
    harnessed by the pharmaceutical industries for the production of antibiotics from
    local sources.&lt;/p&gt;'
