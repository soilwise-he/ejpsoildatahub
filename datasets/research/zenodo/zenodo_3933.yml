  title: Smart Agriculture to Measure Humidity, Temperature, Moisture, Ph. and Nutrient
    Values of the Soil using IoT
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Smart Agriculture now-a-days reducing various problems in farming.
    Farmers get required information and relative data to monitor the plants growth
    by the use of &ldquo;INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)&rdquo;, which connects the different
    sensors, actuators and other embedded devices. To provide quality crops based
    on soil nutrient level and its moisture content along with Ph. factor, also been
    maintained. Hence, in this project all those parameters are detected and controlled
    with the help of micro controller. Humidity sensor to detect the moisture content,
    where colour sensor is used to determine the percentage of soil nutrients (N2
    , P4 &amp;K). It will analyse soil nutrient content present in soil at real time
    and Ph. sensor is used to determine the Ph value of the soil. Monitrring of these
    it provides the proper fertility to the soil depending upon the soil nutrients.
    GSM is used to display the information to the farmers. Thus it reduces the growing
    of husk in terms of wastage and thereby getting good quality and healthy crops.&lt;/p&gt;'
