  title: Temporal and Spatial Variability of the Soil Macropore Tortuosity of Marshland
    Soils in Northern Germany as Influenced by Soil Management Including Liming
  abstract: "The soil oxygen diffusion coefficient (Ds) was determined for structured\
    \ topsoil (0.1 m) and subsoil (0.3 m) samples of a clayey and a silty marshland\
    \ soil, classified as Haplic Gleysol. The undisturbed soil samples were equilibrated\
    \ to a soil matric potential equal to -6 kPa, excavated 7, 12, and \u226524 months\
    \ after liming with a double chamber system. No lime, and either limestone (CaCO3)\
    \ or quicklime (CaO) was incorporated each in two intensities into the ploughed\
    \ topsoils at two sampling sites. In combination with the values of the airfilled\
    \ and total porosities, and with the help of a linear fitting factor, f, measured\
    \ gas diffusion coefficients were fitted to the Millington-Quirk (MQ) tortuosity\
    \ model to better match simulated and measured Ds values. Seven months after lime\
    \ application, the f\u2013values ranged between 0.013 and 0.500, indicating a\
    \ more tortuous pore systems than predicted by the MQ model (f = 1). The f\u2013\
    values increased continuously with time or were highest 12 to \u226524 months\
    \ after CaO application for the topsoils. For each subsoil, the values were in\
    \ the same order of magnitude after 7 and 12 months and increased \u226524 months\
    \ after lime application. The results show, that the soil macropore tortuosity\
    \ as reflected by the f\u2013value is highly dynamic at the time and spatial domains.\
    \ The direct effects of liming on the f\u2013values cannot be determined due to\
    \ several interactions between liming and biotic, abiotic, and management-induced\
    \ soil aggregate formation processes. The results indicate that the f\u2013 values\
    \ increased with liming and that lime-induced soil structural changes are not\
    \ spatially restricted to the topsoil layer where the lime had been applied."
