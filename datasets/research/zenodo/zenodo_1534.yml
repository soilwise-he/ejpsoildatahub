  title: Comparison Of Crop Stress And Soil Maps To Enhance Variable Rate Irrigation
    Prescriptions
  abstract: Soil textural variability within many irrigated fields diminishes the
    effectiveness of conventional irrigation management, and scheduling methods that
    assume uniform soil conditions may produce less than satisfactory results. Furthermore,
    benefits of variable-rate application of agrochemicals, seeds, and nutrients can
    be partially masked by applying inappropriate amounts of water. Center pivot irrigation
    systems can be equipped with variable rate irrigation (VRI) capability and commercial
    VRI systems have been shown to perform dependably. Soil properties will impact
    the optimal application rate for a given location, but that information will need
    to be supplemented with measures of crop stress for in-season adjustment. A field
    study was conducted at the University of Missouri Fisher Delta Research Center
    Marsh Farm at Portageville in 2016 with the objective to compare soil and in-season
    stress maps to help determine their relationship. Apparent soil electrical conductivity
    (ECa) data were used to estimate the clay content and infrared thermometers (IRT)
    were suspended from the center pivot system to measure canopy temperature. While
    much of the growing season had adequate rainfall that prevented high water deficit
    stress levels, measurements on 5 July demonstrated spatial variability in canopy
    temperature and an integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI) that appeared to
    be correlated with soil texture. While seed cotton yield incorporated more than
    just the factors discussed in this report, areas of lowest clay content corresponded
    with the lowest yields. Additional data will be collected under a range of conditions
    and used for statistical comparisons of the observed effects.
