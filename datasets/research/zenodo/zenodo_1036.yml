  title: Safety Level of Microorganism-Bearing Products Applied in Soil-Plant Systems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers adversely affects
    ecological health and soil microbiota provoking loss of soil fertility and greater
    pathogen and pest presence in soil- plant systems, which further reduce the quality
    of food and human health. Therefore, the sustainability, circular economy, environmental
    safety of agricultural production, and health concerns made possible the practical
    realization of eco-friendly biotechnological approaches like organic matter amendments,
    biofertilizers, biopesticides, and reuse of agro-industrial wastes by applying
    novel and traditional methods and processes. However, the advancement in the field
    of Biotechnology/Agriculture is related to the safety of these microorganism-bearing
    products. While the existing regulations in this field are well-known and are
    applied in the preparation and application of waste organic matter and microbial
    inoculants, more attention should be paid to gene transfer, antibiotic resistance,
    contamination of the workers and environment in farms and biotech-plants, and
    microbiome changes. These risks should be carefully assessed, and new analytical
    tools and regulations should be applied to ensure safe and high- quality food
    and a healthy environment for people working in the field of bio-based soil amendments.&lt;/p&gt;'
