  title: Creation of a bacterial library based on strains isolated from soil of Azerbaijan
    and their screening for the presence of new antibacterial biomolecules
  abstract: The major goal of the research project carried out during the years 2014
    - 2018 was to establish a library of microorganisms, including novel, previously
    uncultured bacterial species, isolated from soil of Azerbaijan, and their antibacterial
    screening. For this, 30 soil samples were collected from different zones of Azerbaijan
    and sent to the Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology for bacterial
    isolation and screening. 578 bacterial strains were isolated from 30 soil samples
    and a new bacterial library was created. All 578 isolated strains were analyzed
    for antibacterial activity against two gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
    faecalis) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli) pathogenic strains by growth
    inhibition assay. 62 isolates showed an antibacterial activity against at least
    one pathogenic indicator organism. After supernatant screening, 14 isolates showed
    an inhibitory activity in cell-free culture supernatant.
