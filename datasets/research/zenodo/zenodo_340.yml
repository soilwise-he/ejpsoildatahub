  title: Benefits and Drawbacks of Different Soil Types
  abstract: Traditional methods for classifying soil have several drawbacks, including
    the fact that they take a long time, are<br> expensive, and are intrusive, to
    name a few. Soil monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT) technology assist enhance<br>
    agriculture by increasing production by precisely tracking soil parameters like
    moisture, temperature, humidity, PH,<br> and nutrient content and fertility. The
    data is then collected in cloud storage with the aid of the appropriate data<br>
    operations, enabling us to enhance agricultural strategies and generate trend
    analyses. This allows us to precisely<br> allocate resources and manage our farming
    operations in order to enhance yield. We have read a large number of<br> articles
    in this study that discuss different classification systems and strategies for
    soils.<br>
