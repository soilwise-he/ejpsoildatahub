  title: The Effects Of Soil Chemical Characteristics On Accumulation Of Native Selenium
    By Zea Mays Grains In Maize Belt In Kenya
  abstract: "Selenium is an-antioxidant which is important for\nhuman health enters\
    \ food chain through crops. In Kenya Zea mays is\nconsumed by 96% of population\
    \ hence is a cheap and convenient\nmethod to provide selenium to large number\
    \ of population. Several\nsoil factors are known to have antagonistic effects\
    \ on selenium\nspeciation hence the uptake by Zea mays. There are no studies in\n\
    Kenya that has been done to determine the effects of soil\ncharacteristics (pH,\
    \ Tcarbon, CEC, Eh) affect accumulation of\nselenium in Zea mays grains in Maize\
    \ Belt in Kenya. About 100 Zea mays grain samples together with 100 soil samples\n\
    were collected from the study site put in separate labeled Ziplocs and\nwere transported\
    \ to laboratories at room temperature for analysis.\nMaize grains were analyzed\
    \ for selenium while soil samples were\nanalyzed for pH, Cat Ion Exchange Capacity,\
    \ total carbon, and\nelectrical conductivity. The mean selenium in Zea mays grains\
    \ varied from 1.82 \xB1 0.76\nmg/Kg to 11\xB10.86 mg/Kg. There was no significant\
    \ difference\nbetween selenium levels between different grain batches {\u03C7\
    \ (Df =76)\n= 26.04 P= 1.00} The pH levels varied from 5.43\xB1 0.58 to 5.85\xB1\
    \n0.32. No significant correlations between selenium in grains and soil\npH (Pearson's\
    \ correlations = - 0.143), and between selenium levels in\ngrains and the four\
    \ (pH, Tcarbon, CEC, Eh) soil chemical\ncharacteristics {F (4,91) = 0.721 p =\
    \ 0.579} was observed. It can be concluded that the soil chemical characteristics\
    \ in the\nstudy site did not significantly affect the accumulation of native\n\
    selenium in Zea mays grains."
