  title: CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF URANIUM AND THORIUM IN SOIL AND PLANTS OF FOREST
    ECOSYSTEMS IN THE SOUTH OF THE IRKUTSK REGION
  abstract: "Content of uranium and thorium was estimated in soils and plants of the\
    \ forest ecosystems Olkhinskoe plateau (South of Irkutsk region). In surface soil\
    \ horizons of the uranium content was from 2.3 to 6.6 mg/kg of thorium \u2013\
    \ from 13, 3 to 18.0 mg/kg. The maximum concentration of uranium in the phytomass\
    \ was 0.423 mg/kg ash, thorium \u2013 0.625 mg/kg ash. At the same time, there\
    \ was a direct relationship between the content of radionuclides in the soil (soil-forming\
    \ rock) and the content of radionuclides in the phytomass."
