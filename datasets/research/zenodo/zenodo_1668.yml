  title: Determinants of soil organic matter enhancing technologies disadoption in
    the face of climate vulnerability.
  abstract: "Soil degradation, caused by both natural factors and improper land management\
    \ has been one of the major challenges for agricultural production and food security.\
    \ Implementation of environment-friendly sustainable soil management technologies,\
    \ such as soil organic matter (SOM) enhancing technologies (SOMET) is crucial\
    \ for addressing these issues. However, when farmers discontinue these practices\
    \ after initial adoption, the full potential benefit cannot be achieved. This\
    \ study examines the dis-adoption and non-adoption of SOMET (i.e., organic fertilizer,\
    \ manure and compost) and aims to identify the drivers and constraints of dis-adoption\
    \ among rice farmers. To achieve these objectives, nationally representative datasets\
    \ from three rounds of the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS-2013,\
    \ 2016 and 2020) were utilized. The probit model was employed to analyze information\
    \ from 1,368 rice-farm households in Bangladesh. About 41% of the sample farmers\
    \ were dis-adopters, meaning they had abandoned SOMET after initially practicing\
    \ it. Our findings suggest that increases in flood depth, cyclone and salinity\
    \ vulnerability decrease the likelihood of SOMET dis-adoption (p\u22640.01). Conversely,\
    \ when considering non-adopters as the comparison group, it implies that these\
    \ climate hazards vulnerabilities increase the likelihood of SOMET non-adoption.\
    \ In vulnerable areas to climate hazards, farmers are less likely to dis-adopt\
    \ SOMET because they are more inclined to never adopt the practices in the first\
    \ place. The likelihood of being SOMET dis-adopter is higher in storm-vulnerable\
    \ regions (p\u22640.01), indicating that farmers are more likely to abandon SOMET\
    \ when storm events occur more frequently. Additionally, as the soil organic matter\
    \ level improves in farmers' fields, the likelihood of dis-adopting SOMET increases\
    \ (p\u22640.05). Overall, SOMET dis-adoption is driven by the increased vulnerability\
    \ to climate hazards, as well as increased resilience resulting from improved\
    \ soil organic matter level in farmer's field. This highlights the complexity\
    \ of SOMET adoption and the trade-offs that farmers consider when making decisions\
    \ regarding climate adaptation strategies. Further research is required to understand\
    \ the interaction between SOMET adoption and climate risk management strategies.\
    \ This will inform farmers decision making and policy development to support SOMET\
    \ adoption, ensure sustainable impact of their adoption and climate change mitigation."
