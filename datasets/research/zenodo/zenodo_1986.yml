  title: Chemical Composition of Soil Solutions of Technosols from a Coal Mine Region
    in SouthEastern Europe.
  abstract: The cationic and anionic composition, i.e. K + , Na+ , Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-
    , NO3 - , phosphates, SO4 2- and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solutions
    of Technogenic soils (Technosols) from the area of Maritsa-Iztok coal mine basin
    in Bulgaria was analyzed and links with overburden strata were discussed. Two
    sites are located at the Mednikarovo village with humus and non- humus reclamation
    under grass vegetation. The other two are situated near the village of Obruchishte
    (non-vegetated and pine-vegetated). The sites differ in their textural composition,
    physico-chemical and hydro-physical properties. It was found that major cations
    and anions in the soil solutions at Mednikarovo site did not exceed the maximum
    permissible concentration limits (MPCL) for drinking water, while in solutions
    from the Obruchishte Technosols, composed of black clays intermixed with coal
    ash maximum permissible concentrations of sulphate (250 mg.l -1 ), phosphate (0.5
    mg.l-1 ), calcium (150 mg.l-1 ) and magnesium (80 mg.l-1 ) were exceeded and may
    pose a threat to contamination of surface and sub-surface water of reclaimed soils.
