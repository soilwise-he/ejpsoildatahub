  title: Geochemical Behaviour On Ground Water And Soil Quality In The Vicinity Of
    Industrial Area, Kathiyavadi
  abstract: In the current study, the Kathiyavadi village in the vicinity of industrial
    zone was assessed for its Ground Water and Soil quality status. In this area,
    majority of the industries are Tanning and Leather Industries. In the present
    study, 6 locations have been chosen within the Kathiyavadi Village, for monitoring
    the Water Quality Analysis. The soil samples were collected in the different depth
    of 0-10cm, 10-30cm, 30-60cm respectively in Agriculture Zone and Lake Zone in
    Kathiyavadi industrial zone. The testing was conducted to determine their Physio-Chemical
    Analysis. The results were compared with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
    and IS Codes to check whether the samples are within the prescribed limits. The
    soil samples has shown that the pH ranges from 8.23-14.4 in agricultural zone,
    lake zone pH ranges from 12.2-14.4, EC shows the maximum of 0.3 m/mho, 0.4 m/mho
    in agricultural zone and lake zone in different depth , Organic Carbon ranges
    from 0.02% -0.014% in agricultural zone, lake zone shows 0.017%-0.028%, Sodium
    shows the ranges from 2ppm-10ppm, Potassium ranges from 1ppm-2ppm in both zones.
    Hence, this industrial effluents can affects the ground water resources, soil
    quality and agricultural productions in the selected zone.
