  title: Using Low Permeability Sand-Fadr Mixture Membrane For Isolated Swelling Soil
  abstract: 'Desert regions around the Nile valley in Upper Egypt

    contain great extent of swelling soil. Many different comment

    procedures of treatment of the swelling soils for construction such as

    pre-swelling, load balance OR soil replacement. One of the measure

    factors which affect the level of the aggressiveness of the swelling

    soil is the direction of the infiltration water directions within the

    swelling soils. In this paper a physical model was installed to

    measure the effect of water on the swelling soil with replacement

    using fatty acid distillation residuals (FADR) mixed with sand as

    thick sand-FADR mixture to prevent the water pathway arrive to the

    swelling soil. Testing program have been conducted on different

    artificial samples with different sand to FADR contents ratios (4%,

    6%, and 9%) to get the optimum value fulfilling the impermeable

    replacement. The tests show that a FADR content of 9% is sufficient

    to produce impermeable replacement.'
