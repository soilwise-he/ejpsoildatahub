  title: Real-time ultrasonic water level IoT sensor for in situ permeability soil
    tests
  abstract: Soil permeability tests require a time series of water level measurements
    to determine system losses, including both infiltration and evaporation. Laboratory
    measurements of flow are standardised by international regulations such as ASTM
    International, ISO or UNE, but field measurements are not as well described and,
    in some cases, may require definition and specification of test conditions. This
    is the case for geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) products, where permeability is
    assessed by a laboratory measurement using a flexible wall permeameter as defined
    in standard test method D 5887-04. This method is not able to evaluate the performance
    of such products in the field and therefore cannot guarantee their ability to
    be used for the repair of landfill liner overlays. For this reason, we have defined
    a field test in a confined steel ring and developed a real-time ultrasonic IoT
    device to evaluate water losses over a period. The test method was applied in
    Mallorca (Spain) and as a result the quality of a landfill cover repair solution
    was evaluated, the corresponding civil works were carried out and the basis for
    future field measurements of soil permeability tests on different materials and
    conditions was established.
