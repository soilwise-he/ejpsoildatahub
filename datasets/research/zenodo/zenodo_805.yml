  title: The relationship between soil properties, enzyme activity and land use
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different
    types of land use (forest, tillage and pasture) on soil properties, especially
    enzyme activity. Our investigation was carried out on 53 research plots with 11
    plots in broadleaved forest stands, 12 plots in mixed broadleaved stands, 10 plots
    in mixed coniferous stands, 9 plots on tillage and 11 plots on pasture. The soil
    samples were collected from a depth of 0&ndash;15 cm after removing the organic
    horizon. Contents of organic carbon and nitrogen, pH and soil texture were investigated.
    Furthermore, dehydrogenase and urease activity were determined. Significant differences
    in the enzyme activity between forest and agricultural soils were observed, thus
    demonstrating that enzyme activity is influenced by the organic matter content
    of the soil. The highest enzyme activity was recorded in the forest soil within
    broadleaved stands, whilst the lowest activity was found in tillage soil, because
    tillage soil contained significantly less organic matter. High enzymatic activity
    of pasture soils is the combined result of vegetation type and the lack of plowing.&lt;/p&gt;'
