  title: Response of desert biological soil crusts to alterations in precipitation
    frequency
  abstract: 'Biological soil crusts, a community of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses
    that live on the soil surface, occur in deserts throughout the world. They are
    a critical component of desert ecosystems, as they are important contributors
    to soil fertility and stability. Future climate scenarios predict alteration of
    the timing and amount of precipitation in desert environments. Because biological
    soil crust organisms are only metabolically active when wet, and as soil surfaces
    dry quickly in deserts during late spring, summer, and early fall, the amount
    and timing of precipitation is likely to have significant impacts on the physiological
    functioning of these communities. Using the three dominant soil crust types found
    in the western United States, we applied three levels of precipitation frequency
    (50% below-average, average, and 50% above-average) while maintaining average
    precipitation amount (therefore changing both timing and size of applied events).
    We measured the impact of these treatments on photosynthetic performance (as indicated
    by dark-adapted quantum yield and chlorophyll a concentrations), nitrogenase activity,
    and the ability of these organisms to maintain concentrations of radiation-protective
    pigments (scytonemin, beta-carotene, echinenone, xanthophylls, and canthaxanthin).
    Increased precipitation frequency produced little response after 2.5 months exposure
    during spring (1 April-15 June) or summer (15 June-31 August). In contrast, most
    of the above variables had a large, negative response after exposure to increased
    precipitation frequency for 6 months spring-fall (1 April-31 October) treatment.
    The crusts dominated by the soil lichen Collema, being dark and protruding above
    the surface, dried the most rapidly, followed by the dark surface cyanobacterial
    crusts (Nostoc- Scytonema- Microcoleus), and then by the light cyanobacterial
    crusts (Microcoleus). This order reflected the magnitude of the observed response:
    crusts dominated by the lichen Collema showed the largest decline in quantum yield,
    chlorophyll a, and protective pigments; crusts dominated by Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus
    showed an intermediate decline in these variables; and the crusts dominated by
    Microcoleus showed the least negative response. Most previous studies of crust
    response to radiation stress have been short-term laboratory studies, where organisms
    were watered and kept under moderate temperatures. Such conditions would give
    crust organisms access to ample carbon to respond to imposed stresses (e.g., production
    of UV-protective pigments, replacement of degraded chlorophyll). In contrast,
    our longer-term study showed that under field conditions of high air temperatures
    and frequent, small precipitation events, crust organisms appear unable to produce
    protective pigments in response to radiation stress, as they likely dried more
    quickly than when they received larger, less frequent events. Reduced activity
    time likely resulted in less carbon available to produce or repair chlorophyll
    a and/or protective pigments. Our findings may partially explain the global observation
    that soil lichen cover and richness declines as the frequency of summer rainfall
    increases.'
