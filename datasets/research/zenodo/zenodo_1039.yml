  title: Study on soil quality in different functional zones of Sofia region
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The present study deals with examining the condition of urban\
    \ soils and their potential to deliver soil-related regulating ecosystem services\
    \ concerning the level of anthropogenic pressure in different functional zones\
    \ of Sofia, Bulgaria. Analyses of data for selected characteristics of superficial\
    \ 0-10 cm soil layer of urban soils were performed. Soils were sampled from 30\
    \ experimental plots within a geo-referred network covering urban and peri-urban\
    \ territories. The concentrations of heavy metals Cu, Zn, Pb and Fe were analysed\
    \ to determine the level of pollution, while soil pH, cation-exchange capacity\
    \ (CEC), total carbon and total nitrogen content were used as indicators for assessing\
    \ the regulating ecosystem service \"soil quality\". The results demonstrate the\
    \ differences in the potential of four functional zones \u2013 green zones, industrial\
    \ zones, residential zones and zones for urban agriculture, to regulate and maintain\
    \ \"soil quality\". The purpose of the assessment is to outline the zones with\
    \ the potential for implicating mitigation measures in urban and peri-urban zones,\
    \ based on maps of soil quality, which contributes to focusing more attention\
    \ on the protection and restoration of urban soils, to reduce soil pollution and\
    \ to increase the reuse of urban soils.&lt;/p&gt;"
