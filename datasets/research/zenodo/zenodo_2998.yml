  title: Methodological considerations for monitoring soil/litter arthropods in tropical
    rainforests using DNA metabarcoding, with a special emphasis on ants, springtails
    and termites
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Robust data to refute or support claims of global insect decline
    are currently lacking, particularly for the soil fauna in the tropics. DNA metabarcoding
    represents a powerful approach for rigorous spatial and temporal monitoring of
    the taxonomically challenging soil fauna. Here, we provide a detailed field protocol,
    which was successfully applied in Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama, to collect
    soil samples and arthropods in a tropical rainforest, to be later processed with
    metabarcoding. We also estimate the proportion of soil/litter ant, springtail
    and termite species from the local fauna that can be detected by metabarcoding
    samples obtained either from Berlese-Tullgren (soil samples), Malaise or light
    traps. Each collecting method detected a rather distinct fauna. Soil and Malaise
    trap samples detected 213 species (73%) of all target species. Malaise trap samples
    detected many ant species, whereas soil samples were more efficient at detecting
    springtail and termite species. With respect to long-term monitoring of soil-dwelling
    and common species (more amenable to statistical trends), the best combination
    of two methods were soil and light trap samples, detecting 94% of the total of
    common species. A protocol including 100 soil, 40 Malaise and 80 light trap samples
    annually processed by metabarcoding would allow the long-term monitoring of at
    least 11%, 18% and 16% of species of soil/litter ants, springtails and termites,
    respectively, present on BCI, and a high proportion of the total abundance (up
    to 80% of all individuals) represented by these taxa.&lt;/p&gt;'
