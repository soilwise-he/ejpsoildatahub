  title: Investigation of pollution of the soil cover of objects of Sumgait area of
    the Absheron peninsula with heavy metals
  abstract: "In a paper, the investigations of pollution of the soil cover of objects\
    \ of Sumgait region of the Absheron peninsula with heavy metals have been carried\
    \ out. The microelements composition of the grey-brown soils of Sumgait region\
    \ taken from the territory of superphosphate plant has been studied. According\
    \ to the content of microelements, the investigated soils in the North\u2013Western\
    \ and southern parts of the Absheron Peninsula have been grouped on a degree of\
    \ concentration of heavy metals depending on the depth of the investigated soils.\
    \ The zinc (77.0 mg/kg, at depth 0\u201316 cm, soil profile no. 03), copper and\
    \ cadmium (88 mg/kg and 0,36 mg/kg at depth 0-20 cm, soil profile no. 05) have\
    \ the highest concentration in comparison with other microelements. Depending\
    \ on the location of the key areas from sources of technogenic emissions, the\
    \ content of heavy metals is changed. Thus, it has been revealed that in the soils\
    \ investigated by us on the territory of the superphosphate plant the most important\
    \ micro elements, i.e. heavy metals have been unevenly distributed."
