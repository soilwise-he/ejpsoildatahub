  title: Estimating Yield from NDVI,Weather Data, and Soil Water Depletion for Sugar
    Beet and Potato in Northern Belgium
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Crop-yield models based on vegetation indices such as the normalized
    difference vegetation&lt;br&gt;

    index (NDVI) have been developed to monitor crop yield at higher spatial and temporal
    resolutions&lt;br&gt;

    compared to agricultural statistical data. We evaluated the model performance
    of NDVI-based&lt;br&gt;

    random forest models for sugar beet and potato farm yields in northern Belgium
    during 2016&ndash;2018.&lt;br&gt;

    We also evaluated whether weather variables and root-zone soil water depletion
    during the growing&lt;br&gt;

    season improved the model performance. The NDVI integral did not explain early
    and late potato&lt;br&gt;

    yield variability and only partly explained sugar-beet yield variability. The
    NDVI series of early and&lt;br&gt;

    late potato crops were not sensitive enough to yield affecting weather and soil
    water conditions. We&lt;br&gt;

    found that water-saturated conditions early in the growing season and elevated
    temperatures late&lt;br&gt;

    in the growing season explained a large part of the sugar-beet and late-potato
    yield variability. The&lt;br&gt;

    NDVI integral in combination with monthly precipitation, maximum temperature,
    and root-zone soil&lt;br&gt;

    water depletion during the growing season explained farm-scale sugar beet (R2
    = 0.84, MSE = 48.8)&lt;br&gt;

    and late potato (R2 = 0.56, MSE = 57.3) yield variability well from 2016 to 2018
    in northern Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;'
