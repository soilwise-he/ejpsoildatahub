  title: Soil sampling when examining forests for radioactive contamination
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Forest ecosystems are complex areas in terms of rehabilitation
    of radioactively contaminated areas, so conducting an up-to-date examination of
    these areas for radioactive contamination is relevant. The paper considers the
    improvement of methods of soil sampling for obtaining representative materials
    in the estimation of vertical migration of&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs in
    the soil profile and the level of soil contamination with&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.
    The density of radioactive soil contamination was studied by reducing the number
    of selected samples from 30 to 3 in the layers of 10, 20, and 30&nbsp;cm. The
    results show that when the number of soil samples decreases, the average magnitudes
    of soil contamination with&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs are not significantly
    different within each analyzed layer. It was noted that at sampling in the 10-centimeter
    layer, the studied indicator was 1.3&ndash;1.4&nbsp;times lower than in the layers
    of 20 and 30&nbsp;cm, and there is no difference between the latter. To obtain
    reliable levels of radioactive contamination of the territory, it is necessary
    to perform 10-time repeated sampling in the forest soil layer of 30&nbsp;cm. At
    a decrease in the number of soil samples from 10 to 3, the fluctuation of average
    values of the specific activity of&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs in different
    layers of soil profile is low. To obtain representative magnitudes of&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs
    content in each layer of the soil profile, it is necessary to make various samplings.
    Thus, for 4-time repeated sampling, is sufficient for all layers of forest litter,
    and 6-time repeated sampling is enough for the humus-eluvial horizon. It is necessary
    to perform 8-time repeated sampling for the eluvial and illuvial horizon, and
    10-time repeated sampling for illuvial sand and parent rock. The obtained results
    make it possible to carry out up-to-date examination of forests for radioactive
    contamination based on the updated methodology and using the obtained data on&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs
    migration in forest soils&lt;/p&gt;'
