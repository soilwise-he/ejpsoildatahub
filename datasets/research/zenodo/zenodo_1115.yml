  title: Spatial heterogeneity of soil acidity properties in peatlands of Western
    Siberia
  abstract: 'The formation of significant amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) water-soluble
    organic compounds, which are highly reactive compounds of a non-specific nature,
    is a feature of the biogeocenoses of the North. Soil acidity, which in turn depends
    on LMW organic acids content, regulates the migration ability of compounds in
    landscapes and the bioavailability of nutrients. With an increase in the active
    layer thickness of peat soils in Western Siberia in the course of climate warming,
    new portions of LMW water-soluble organic compounds will enter, which will be
    quickly processed by microorganisms into CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Five
    key sites were considered, located within thawed oligotrophic, frozen mound and
    polygonal bogs. The analysis of zonal patterns of acidity changes in the waters
    of peat soils indicates an increase in the pH in the series: northern taiga&lt;forest
    tundra&lt;southern tundra. A feature of the most acidic soils of the northern
    taiga is the high content of low molecular weight organic acids, the accumulation
    of which is determined by the species diversity of the vegetation cover and high
    humidity. The decrease in the content of acids in the soils of the southern tundra
    is due to changes in climatic conditions and, accordingly, the quality and quantity
    of organic material involved in the processes of mineralization and humification.
    Relationships between the pH of the soil solution and such parameters as the specific
    conductivity, the content of dissolved organic carbon, and the specific UV-absorbency
    (SUVA<sub>245</sub>) were revealed. Comparison of the acidity indices of peat
    soils of the zonal series of the European Northeast with similar ones obtained
    for the study area of Western Siberia showed that, at the same values of actual
    acidity, the exchangeable acidity values of peat soils of Western Siberia are
    slightly lower.'
