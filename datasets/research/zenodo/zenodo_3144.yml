  title: Use of the residues left after harvesting of Cole crops as bio fumigants
    for decreasing the incidence of soil born pest diseases in agriculture.
  abstract: "In crop production, the threats of soilborne pathogens, disease epidemics,\
    \ climate change, high cost of chemical (nematicides and fungicides), development\
    \ of chemical resistance and new disease outbreaks are increasing worldwide. Soil\
    \ borne pathogen and plant-parasite nematodes difficult to manage once they established\
    \ in soil. Many chemical fumigants effectively suppress pathogen, but most of\
    \ the compounds are harmful to the environment. Biofumigants can be an option\
    \ for disrupting disease and nematode life cycle. The use of Cole and other Brassica\
    \ crops residues as biofumigants has emerged as an environment friendly alternative\
    \ to prevention of soil borne pest diseases and chemical soil fumigation treatment.\
    \ \n\nKeywords: Cole crops, fungicides, nematicides, resistance."
