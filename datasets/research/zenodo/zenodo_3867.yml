  title: 'Using soil samples and footwear to improve forensic palynology: A study
    about where a soil sample could best be taken along a transect from parking space
    to dumping site when investigating a crime scene'
  abstract: This study investigates the transfer of soil to shoe soles when a perpetrator
    disposes of a corpse in a forested area. During such an action soil is transferred
    to the shoe soles, but it is unknown which point(s) along the transect transfers
    the most soil to the shoe soles. This information is needed for taking a soil
    sample at a crime scene to make a comparison between the crime scene and the shoes
    which are thought to be linked with the crime. Previous research has mainly been
    focused on case studies while experimental data is lacking. This study will therefore
    focus on collecting experimental data by simulating the dumping of a corpse at
    five different locations. The pollen underneath the boots and the pollen along
    the transect are compared with each other to see where the highest similarity
    between the boots and the transect could be found. The similarity indicates where
    the transfer of soil to the shoe soles is highest and thus where a soil sample
    during investigation of a crime scene should be taken. The point with the highest
    similarity to the boots varies between the locations. This indicates that the
    transfer of soil to shoe soles does not happen at a set point along the transect,
    but depends on different factors, like moisture, ground coverage and compacted
    soil. The locations Heemskerk, IJsselstein and Bosrand showed the highest similarity
    with the points which were the muddiest, had the lowest amount of compacted soil
    or had limited ground coverage. The locations Schaapsallee and Utrechtse Heuvelrug
    showed the highest similarity with the average of the total transect because the
    moisture, ground coverage and compacted soil were comparable throughout the complete
    transect. In addition, the total transect showed a high similarity with the boots
    at every location. However, when the amounts of moisture, ground coverage and
    compacted soil varied along a transect, there was always one point along that
    transect with a higher similarity to the boots than they had with the total transect.
    In conclusions, the point(s) were soil is transferred to shoes are the muddiest
    part, the points with limited ground coverage or the least compacted soil. However,
    if the whole transect shows similarities in these factors, it is best to take
    multiple samples along the transect from which the average could be used.
