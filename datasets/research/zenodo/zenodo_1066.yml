  title: On the presence and detectability of polyphosphates in soil microbial biomass
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphates (PolyP), i.e. phosphate polymers, are commonly\
    \ found in pure cultures of various microorganisms. Although they have been the\
    \ subject of intensive microbiological research in the past, they have never been\
    \ directly studied in species-rich soil microbial communities. So far, there are\
    \ only few studies indirectly suggesting that soil microorganisms build up PolyP\
    \ as a storage for phosphorus (P), and use them when soil P availability decreases.\
    \ We attempted to provide direct evidence for PolyP presence in soil microorganisms,\
    \ and test if the PolyP can be detected in the soil microbial biomass P pool applying\
    \ the standard chloroform-fumigation extraction method. Twelve different soil\
    \ samples were collected along the gradient of forest recovery after the bark\
    \ beetle outbreak in the catchments of two adjacent glacier lakes (Ple\u0161n\xE9\
    \ and \u010Certovo, Bohemian forest, Czech Republic). The presence of PolyP in\
    \ the samples was assessed by staining in a manipulative experiment designed to\
    \ deplete any PolyP present. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and P in the microbial\
    \ biomass were estimated by the chloroform-fumigation extraction method and soil\
    \ slurries of fresh samples stained by the Neisser method. The soils were then\
    \ mixed with sterile sand and supplemented with growth medium without P. The rate\
    \ of growth of microbial biomass was estimated from oxygen consumption during\
    \ one week incubation at dark. After one week, the microbial biomass C, N, and\
    \ the P were estimated again and samples stained. The combination of the incubation\
    \ experiment and staining proved that the soil microorganisms in the collected\
    \ samples contained PolyP and that PolyP were used to achieve maximum growth rate\
    \ under P-limited conditions. The C to N to P ratio increased significantly over\
    \ one week of incubation reflecting the changing PolyP content. To further confirm\
    \ that the fumigation extraction method is sensitive to PolyP content, manufactured\
    \ PolyP was added to all soils at different steps of the fumigation extraction\
    \ method, and its recovery was estimated. Recovery ranged from 80 to 100%. Abiotic\
    \ depolymerisation at acidic conditions required for the correct quantification\
    \ of P-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; using molybdenum-blue method was very likely\
    \ responsible for half of the recovery, the remaining being enzymatic depolymerisation.\
    \ We conclude that PolyP are ubiquitous in soils and affect microbial biomass\
    \ P estimation. The high recovery rate of PolyP around 90% implies that presence\
    \ of PolyP can cause a significant overestimation of the microbial biomass P when\
    \ typical correction factor 0.4 is used.&lt;/p&gt;"
