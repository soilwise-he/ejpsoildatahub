  title: Evaluation of the effect of maize-legume intercropping on soil moisture improvement
    in arid area of Bena-Tsemay district, South omo zone, Southern Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Usually crop failure due to moisture shortage in soils is very
    much common due to high evaporation. Sometimes famers try to combat this problem
    by using mulches of crop residues in the study area. However, this is also highly
    challenged shortage because the crop residues used as feed for animals. Therefore,
    using the advantage and opportunity of cover legumes as an intercrop is the solution
    of the problems simultaneously in addition to their contribution improving soil
    nutrient balance and other many fold benefits. Therefore, this study aimed for
    evaluating the effect of maize-legume covers intercropping on soil moisture improvement
    and crop yield in moisture stress areas of the study area. The entire grain yield
    of maize and legumes, as well as soil moisture data were collected. The result
    on soil moisture revealed that intercropping of maize with cowpea had better soil
    moisture contents during active crop development (15.98%) and after harvest (16.70%)
    in average as compared to the others. The current finding also showed that adopting
    intercropping of maize with cowpea-boosted yield by 5256.24 kg ha-1 maize and
    977.45 kg ha-1 cowpea in average with higher moisture improvement as compare to
    the other treatments. Therefore, intercropping of maize with cowpea is important
    to farmers since it would provide additional crop yield with the same piece of
    land. However, to get considerable changes on soil and water balances, other soil
    physic-chemical properties and crop yields, conducting similar studies in more
    than two years period at permanent field plots is paramount in the future.&lt;/p&gt;'
