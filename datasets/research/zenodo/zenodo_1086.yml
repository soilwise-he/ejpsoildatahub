  title: Soil Salinization May Trigger Mercury Mobilisation from Contaminated Soils
    and Sediment
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Mercury (Hg) contamination of soils is a concerning issue worldwide\
    \ due to its high toxicity and risk to human health. Source of contamination,\
    \ chemical form and environmental conditions affect its mobility and hence bioavailability.\
    \ Contaminated coastal soils, could potentially become hotspots of Hg re-mobilisation,\
    \ because of simultaneous flooding and salinization caused by sea level rise as\
    \ a consequence of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of our work was to\
    \ assess changes in Hg solubility in soils and sediments, with different type\
    \ of Hg contamination, after exposure to salt and flood stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A\
    \ soil contaminated by mining activity (mainly cinnabar-Hg) and a sediment heavily\
    \ contaminated by a chlor-alkali plant (mainly elemental Hg) were collected from\
    \ North-East Italy. Mercury speciation was performed either by Thermal Desorption\
    \ (TD) or by a Sequential Extraction Procedure (SEP) to quantify operationally\
    \ defined binding forms (soluble, exchangeable, bound to Mn or Fe oxides, bound\
    \ to organic matter, non-cinnabar and cinnabar Hg forms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A\
    \ bench top simulation with\_0 to 32.8 g l-1 salt solution was carried out in\
    \ microcosms filled with\_contaminated soil or sediment, to characterize flood\
    \ effects on Hg mobility. Soils were kept submerged for different inundation periods\
    \ (1, 7 and 30 days). After the flooding treatment, a rain event was simulated\
    \ using artificial rain water. Solubilised Hg of each flood and each leaching\
    \ treatment was measured by ICP-MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thermal desorption showed\
    \ the presence of two main forms of Hg: organic bound Hg and HgS. The cinnabar-Hg\
    \ peak was largely prevalent in the mine-contaminated soil, whereas the organic-bound-Hg\
    \ peak was prevalent in the chlor-alkali contaminated sediment. This difference\
    \ was confirmed by the liquid SEP speciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hg mobility increased\
    \ with increasing salinity and flooding time. The effect of salt concentration\
    \ was more pronounced for longer flooding periods. After 1 day of inundation,\
    \ the amount of solubilised Hg was negligible, but after 7 days flooding Hg levels\
    \ in the highest saline solution reached up to 0.9 and 9.3 \xB5g Hg L-1 in the\
    \ soil and in the sediment simulations, respectively. The mobility of Hg increased\
    \ substantially after 30 days, and was about 22 times in the soil (19.8 \xB5g\
    \ Hg L-1) and 10 times in the sediment (89.8 \xB5g Hg L-1) compared to the background\
    \ level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show a potential risk of Hg re-mobilization\
    \ from contaminated coastal soils and sediments as consequence of sea level rise\
    \ and their consequent salinization.&lt;/p&gt;"
