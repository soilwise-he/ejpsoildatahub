  title: A Suite of Models for Producing Synthetic, Small-scale Thermal Imagery of
    Vegetated Soil Surfaces
  abstract: "A high-resolution, computational suite has been constructed to produce\
    \ synthetic \nthermal imagery of vegetated soil surfaces.  Because a soil\u2019\
    s moisture affects its \nthermal response, the model suite must include both moisture\
    \ and energy \nmovement within the soil and plants.  Thus, the suite consists\
    \ of a soil model, \na vegetation model, and a ray-casting model.  The models\
    \ run simultaneously \non a single, parallel or serial computer and communicate\
    \ using sockets.  \n\nThe soil model is a three-dimensional, spatially adaptive,\
    \ continuous Galerkin, \nfinite element model that simulates partially-saturated\
    \ flow and heat transport, \ncoupled to two-dimensional surface water flow.  The\
    \ vegetation model simulates \ninfrared absorption, reflection, and transmission\
    \ by discretized plant leaves and \nstems.  Ray casting provides boundary conditions\
    \ for the soil and vegetation \nthermal models, and produces multi-spectral images\
    \ of energy reflected and \nemitted from the synthetic scene.  Subsurface phase\
    \ change, distributed root \nzone moisture uptake and transpiration, and flow\
    \ through macropores and \ncracks are processes under construction.   \n\nExample\
    \ calculations to be presented include a multi-million-element simulation \nfor\
    \ an arid test site that is only a few meters in its longest dimension.  The models\
    \ \nare driven with meteorological data and are built using material property\
    \ data \ncollected at the field site.  Synthetic images produced are compared\
    \ against those \nfrom thermal cameras.  A long-term goal of this work is to help\
    \ build inversion \nsoftware to estimate ground state information (soil moisture\
    \ and physical property \ndistributions) from airborne imagery."
