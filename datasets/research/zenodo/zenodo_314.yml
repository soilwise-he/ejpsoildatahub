  title: EXPANSIVE SOIL STABILIZATION USING IRON ORE TAILINGS
  abstract: The foundation of the natural world is the soil, which is prevalent in
    many parts of India and has a high silt content, low strength, and weak bearing
    ability. The loads placed on these soils during construction or during the structures
    useful life are too great for them to bear. In India, expansive soil covers 20
    percent of the land. To enhance the functionality of expansive soils, soil stabilization
    is used.In this research work, an attempt has been made to use Iron Ore Tailings
    (IOT) an industrial by-product as stabilizing agent for expansive soil. In this
    study, expansive soil is replaced with IOT from 0% to 30% at 5% interval. It was
    found from the experimental observations that the values of Liquid limit and Plastic
    limit decreased with increase in percentage of IOT. Free swell index shows a total
    decrement of 55% at 30% IOT content. MDD of standard and modified compaction increased
    with higher percentage of IOT whereas the OMC decreased accordingly. CBR values
    of un-soaked condition yielded whereas no penetration resistance was observed
    in soaked condition. Swelling pressure effectively decreased to a total of 50%
    at 30% IOT content. Hence, it can be concluded that IOT will help in improving
    the mechanical properties of expansive soil.
