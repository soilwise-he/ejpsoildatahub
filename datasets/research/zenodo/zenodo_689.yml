  title: DETERMINATION OF THERMAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL IN SOLAR GREENHOUSES
  abstract: <em>In all countries of the world, in particular Uzbekistan, special attention
    has recently been given to the issues of energy and resource conservation, environmental
    protection, and the search for alternative energy sources to replace traditional
    energy resources in the future. At the moment, there is intensive growth in the
    use of renewable energy sources, with solar energy and power plants based on solar
    energy being considered the main developing area. Solar systems can be used primarily
    in the country's southern regions, characterized by favorable climatic conditions,
    abundant sunny days, and high solar radiation intensity.</em> <em>The article
    discusses the study of heavy loamy soils, under the same conditions, the thermal
    conductivity is always lower than that of light and medium loamy soils. Thus,
    it is confirmed by the conducted experiments that the substrate layer 0-30 cm
    accumulates about the same amount of heat, and with increasing humidity, the thermal
    conductivity slowly grows.</em>
