  title: Assessment Of The Potential Risks Associated With The Proposed Use Of Composted
    Waste From The Production Of Bacitracin As A Soil Additive
  abstract: 'Bacitracin is a hexapeptide antibiotic produced by some strains of B.
    licheniformis. It is mainly active against Grampositive bacteria, although many
    differences in susceptibility exist among the bacterial species.<br>

    The Norwegian Food Safety Authority commissioned a risk assessment regarding the
    use of composted waste material from production of bacitracin, as a soil additive.
    The Panel on Biological Hazards concludes that the risks to human health and the
    environment posed by residual bacitracin present in the finished product are minimal.
    As Bacillus licheniformis is considered non-pathogenic the risk posed by this
    bacterium to human health or the environment is very low. It is reasonable to
    assume that during the early composting process horizontal transfer of bacitracin
    and erythromycin resistance genes, from the B. licheniformis producer strain to
    environmental bacteria, will exceed background levels. This is considered to represent
    a low risk to human health and the environment.'
