  title: The Effect of Soil Surface Slope on Splash Distribution under Water Drop
    Impact
  abstract: The effects of down slope steepness on soil splash distribution under
    a water drop impact have been investigated in this study. The equipment used are
    the burette to simulate a water drop, a splash cup filled with sandy soil which
    forms the source area and a splash board to collect the ejected particles. The
    results found in this study have shown that the apparent mass increased with increasing
    downslope angle following a linear regression equation with high coefficient of
    determination. In the same way, the radial soil splash distribution over the distance
    has been analyzed statistically, and an exponential function was the best fit
    of the relationship for the different slope angles. The curves and the regressions
    equations validate the well known FSDF and extend the theory of Van Dijk.
