  title: Variables Controlling for Atterberg Limits of Kota Stone Slurry Dust Stabilized
    Expansive Soil
  abstract: The production rate of industrialization increases the demand for waste
    disposal. The method of disposing waste in soil is one of the conventional methods
    which require a large area of land, but now due to the lack of availability of
    land, this waste is used as a soil stabilizer in the technique of soil stabilization.
    From the civil engineering point of view, the kota stone dust, marble dust, rice
    husk, fly ash, blast furnace slag, foundry sand, glass waste, tiles waste, ceramics
    waste etc. are the commonly waste which are used as a construction materials with
    replacement of conventional materials successfully and also having effective characteristics
    required by a good soil stabilization admixture. In this paper, the reduction
    of this problematic nature of soil by blending of stone quarry waste material
    such as kota stone slurry has been attempted. A number of Consistency Limits (Liquid
    Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index) tests are carried out on Expansive
    soil (Black Cotton Soil) stabilized with various kota stone slurry (KSS) contents.
    The results show that Consistency limits (C<sub>L</sub>) fitting curves were followed
    liner pattern with the increase in KSS and a linear line function has been fitted
    to assess the optimum relationship between C<sub>L</sub> and KSS percentage. It
    is observed that for the relationship among C<sub>L</sub> and KSS, the optimum
    fit could be obtained after applying the slope equal to -0.4 to the KSS content
    (L) parameter. Finally, a unique relationship between C<sub>L</sub> and KSS is
    also established, i.e., C<sub>L</sub> = 86.53-18.64x-0.4k, where k and x represents
    KSS contents and various consistency limits.
