  title: Geotechnical Properties of Lateritic Soil for Sub Base And Base Materials
    in Road Construction in Nyaruguru District, Rwanda
  abstract: "<em>Lateritic soils have wider applications in Rwandan construction industry,\
    \ especially in road-construction projects where they are used as filling materials\
    \ in flexible pavement foundations. This study is aimed on to analyze the quality\
    \ and suitability of the lateritic soils for Sub base and Base materials for road\
    \ construction in Nyaruguru District, Rwanda.</em> <em>This is research utilized\
    \ an experimental study design approach to implement this study. Four sites were\
    \ randomly chosen throughout Nyaruguru district from which disturbed and undisturbed\
    \ lateritic soil samples at a depth of 2 m were collected. The collected samples\
    \ were analyzed with a series of standardized laboratory tests for soil to determine\
    \ their properties and usage in road construction.</em> <em>The findings show\
    \ that particle size distribution of lateritic soils found throughout all sample\
    \ have high quantity of coarse gravelly soil the average is 46.81% apart from\
    \ sample SL3 which had 26.04%, by using USC classification shown that all sites\
    \ are gravelly silt except SL1 which is CL (sand lean clay with gravel). Natural\
    \ moisture content range between 11.38 to 19% and mean value was observed at 15.31%.\
    \ Maximum dry unit weight (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) were found\
    \ to be 2 KN/m3 and 2.43 % respectively. The specific gravity ranges between 2.66\
    \ and 2.93 with an average of 2.77. Liquid limits range between 23.2 to 35.5%,\
    \ plastic limits 15 to 27.1% and plasticity index 6 to 10%. Average cohesion and\
    \ angle of internal friction are 31.5 KN and 55.7\xB0 respectively. The CBR ranges\
    \ from 14.17 to 32.9%. </em> <em>The results shows that lateritic soils from Nyaruguru\
    \ district of Rwanda in area SL1, SL2, SL3 are suitable for sub-grade and SL1\
    \ and SL2 are also suitable for sub-base material since the geotechnical properties\
    \ fairly within the regulatory standards<strong>.</strong></em>"
