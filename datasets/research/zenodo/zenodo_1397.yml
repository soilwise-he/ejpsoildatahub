  title: Effective land preparation for wet seeding on a reclaimed saline soil in
    Korea
  abstract: This article 'Effective land preparation for wet seeding on a reclaimed
    saline soil in Korea' appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series,
    created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each
    other informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific notes
    are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to obtain
    details on the research reported.
