  title: The Impact of Multiple Species Invasion on Soil and Plant Communities Increases
    With Invasive Species Co-occurrence
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Despite increasing evidence indicating that invasive species
    are harming biodiversity, ecological systems and processes, impacts of multiple
    species invasion and their links with changes in plant and soil communities are
    inadequately documented and remain poorly understood. Addressing multiple invaders
    would help to ward against community-wide, synergistic effects, aiding in designing
    more effective control strategies. In this work, correlative relationships are
    examined for potential impacts of three co-occurring invasive plant species, &lt;em&gt;Amorpha
    fruticosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fraxinus pennsylvanica&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Acer
    negundo&lt;/em&gt;, on soil conditions and native plant diversity. The research
    was conducted in riparian ecosystems and included the following treatments: (1)
    co-occurrence of the three invasive plant species, (2) occurrence of a single
    invasive species, and (3) control, i.e., absence of invasive species. Co-occurrence
    of three invasive plant species caused higher direct impact on soil properties,
    soil functioning, and native plant diversity. Soil in mixed plots (those populated
    with all three invaders) contained higher levels of nitrifying bacteria, organic
    matter, nitrogen, and carbon as well as lower carbon to nitrogen ratio as compared
    to single species invaded plots and control plots. Furthermore, native plant diversity
    decreased with invasive plants co-occurrence. Differences in soil conditions and
    lower native plant diversity revealed the interactive potential of multiple invasive
    species in depleting biodiversity and eroding soil functionality, ultimately affecting
    ecological and biogeochemical processes both below and above ground. Our results
    highlight the need to prevent the impact of multispecies invasion, suggesting
    that riparian ecosystems affected by co-occurring invaders should be prioritized
    for invasion monitoring and ecological restoration.&lt;/p&gt;'
