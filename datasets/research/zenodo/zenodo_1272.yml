  title: 'Interactions between agricultural management and soil biodiversity: an overview
    of current knowledge'
  abstract: This book presents a literature review of the soil biodiversity problems
    of the European Farmers and the strategies developed to solve them.<br> The aspects
    considered in this revision book are:<br> - The importance of the soil biodiversity
    in the design of cropping systems.<br> - Crop rotation and its effect over the
    edaphic fauna.<br> - The effect of tillage on the communities that inhabit in
    the cultivated soils.<br> - The ability of soil fauna to regulate the proliferation
    of pathogenic fungi related to certain crop diseases.<br> - Different types of
    bacteria that promote plant growth.<br> - The relationship between soil contamination
    and biodiversity.<br> - The effect of organic and synthetic fertilizers on the
    biodiversity of the edaphic fauna.<br> - The development of alarm systems that
    allow the early detection of pathogens.<br> - The increase in soil quality associated
    with the use of cover crops.<br> - The use of trap crops to reduce the use of
    pesticides while maintaining production and quality. This work was funded by the
    European Commission Horizon 2020 project SoildiverAgro [grant agreement 817819].
