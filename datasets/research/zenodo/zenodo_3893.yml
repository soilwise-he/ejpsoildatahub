  title: Classification Of Soil Aptness To Establish Of Panicum Virgatum In Mississippi
    Using Sensitivity Analysis And Gis
  abstract: 'During the last decade Panicum virgatum, known as

    Switchgrass, has been broadly studied because of its remarkable

    attributes as a substitute pasture and as a functional biofuel source.

    The objective of this investigation was to establish soil suitability for

    Switchgrass in the State of Mississippi. A linear weighted additive

    model was developed to forecast soil suitability. Multicriteria

    analysis and Sensitivity analysis were utilized to adjust and optimize

    the model. The model was fit using seven years of field data

    associated with soils characteristics collected from Natural Resources

    Conservation System - United States Department of Agriculture

    (NRCS-USDA). The best model was selected by correlating

    calculated biomass yield with each model''s soils-based output for

    Switchgrass suitability. Coefficient of determination (r2) was the

    decisive factor used to establish the ''best'' soil suitability model.

    Coefficients associated with the ''best'' model were implemented

    within a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create a map of

    relative soil suitability for Switchgrass in Mississippi. A Geodatabase

    associated with soil parameters was built and is available for future

    Geographic Information System use.'
