  title: 'Dynamic of nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon in an alpine forested catchment:
    atmospheric deposition and soil solution trends'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have reported decreasing trends of acidifying\
    \ and N deposition inputs to forest areas throughout Europe and the USA in recent\
    \ decades. There is a need to assess the responses of the ecosystem to declining\
    \ atmospheric pollution by monitoring the variations of chemical species in the\
    \ various compartments of the forest ecosystem on a long temporal scale. In this\
    \ study, we report on patterns and trends in throughfall deposition concentrations\
    \ of inorganic N, dissolved organic N (DON) and C (DOC) over a 20-year (1995\u2013\
    2015) period in the LTER site -Val Masino (1190 m a.s.l.), a spruce forest, in\
    \ the Central Italian Alps. The same chemical species were studied in the litter\
    \ floor leachates and mineral soil solution, at three different depths (15, 40\
    \ and 70 cm), over a 10-year period (2005\u20132015). Inorganic N concentration\
    \ was drastically reduced as throughfall and litter floor leachates percolated\
    \ through the topsoil, where the measured mean values (2 \xB5eq L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ were much lower than the critical limits established for coniferous stands (14\
    \ \xB5eq L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). The seasonal temperature dependence of throughfall\
    \ DOC and DON concentration suggests that the microbial community living on the\
    \ needles was the main source of dissolved organic matter. Most of DOC and DON\
    \ infiltrating from the litter floor were retained in the mineral soil. The rainfall\
    \ amount was the only climatic factor exerting a control on DOC and N compounds\
    \ in throughfall and forest floor leachates over a decadal period. Concentration\
    \ of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; declined by 50%\
    \ and 26% respectively in throughfall deposition. Trends of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in forest floor leachates and mineral soil solution\
    \ mirrored declining depositions. No trends in both DON and DOC concentration\
    \ and in DOC/DON ratio in soil solutions were observed. These outcomes suggest\
    \ that the declining NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ atmospheric inputs did not influence the dynamic of DON and DOC in the Val Masino\
    \ forest. The results of this study are particularly relevant, as they are based\
    \ on a comprehensive survey of all the main compartments of the forest ecosystem.\
    \ Moreover, this kind of long-term research has rarely been carried out in the\
    \ Alpine region.&lt;/p&gt;"
