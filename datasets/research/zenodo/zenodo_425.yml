  title: Interactive Effects of Soil Salinity and Water Table Depth on Soil Properties
    and Sorghum (Sorghum Bicolor L. Moench) Production
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil salinity and water table are the most prevalent and widespread
    problems limiting crop productivity in irrigated agriculture. Our experiment aims
    to evaluate the effect of soil salinity and water table on some soil properties,
    growth, and yield of sorghum (variety Giza 15) grown along two successive seasons.
    Nine different sites were chosen, representing three levels of soil salinity (i.e.
    ECe &lt; 4, 4-8 and 8-16 dS m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For each salinity level
    three water table were selected (i.e. shallow &asymp; 55 cm, medium &asymp; 80
    cm and deep &asymp; 120 cm). Results revealed that there are main considerable
    effects of salinity and water table on some soil properties. Increasing of salinity
    caused significant decreases in plant growth, weight of 1000 grains (g), protein
    content% and&nbsp; seed yield (t/ha) which decreased by 36.98%, 32.27%, 20.45%,
    29.95 % and 57.46% respectively, when salinity increased from S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;
    to S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, decreasing of water table lead
    to improvement in all mentioned soil properties and plant growth. The results
    indicated that need to maintain low or moderate salinity and deep water table,
    which is essential for producing high sorghum grain yield with satisfactory quality.&lt;/p&gt;'
