  title: Arsenic, Nickel And Leadremoval From Underground Wells By Adsorption On Laterite
    Soil
  abstract: "<strong><em>The pollution by heavy metal in the environment, particularly\
    \ groundwater, constitutes an environmental problem and health in C\xF4te d\u2019\
    Ivoire. Among methods used for removal heavy metals, adsorption by natural absorbent\
    \ such as a laterite is effective and cheap when compared to other methods. So,\
    \ this study evaluates the laterite reactor performance for effective removal\
    \ of heavy metals viz., arsenic (As), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) from real-life\
    \ groundwater. And adsorption of heavy metals was performed with laterite of different\
    \ particle sizes, viz. coarse grain size of laterite (LRCOG) and laterite granules\
    \ (LRG). The results obtained showed that the percentages of removal of heavy\
    \ metal are higher than the size of the laterite. As, Ni and Pb removal are 98.3\
    \ \xB1 0.4%, 99.2 \xB1 0.2% and 96.1 \xB1 1.1% respectively in LRCOG effluents.\
    \ With the laterite in form of granules, percentage removal were of 98.6 \xB1\
    \ 0.3% for As that of the Ni is of 99.7 \xB1 0.2% and 97.9 \xB1 0.5 % for Pb.\
    \ The adsorption of heavy metal on the two types of laterite particle size is\
    \ in the same order of effectiveness: Ni\u02C3As\u02C3Pb</em>.</strong>"
