  title: Effect of Farmyard Manure Application on Yield and Soil Fertility in Rice-Wheat
    Rotation
  abstract: This article 'Effect of Farmyard Manure Application on Yield and Soil
    Fertility in Rice-Wheat Rotation' appeared in the International Rice Research
    Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite
    communication among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology
    for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists
    keep each other informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific
    notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to
    obtain details on the research reported.
