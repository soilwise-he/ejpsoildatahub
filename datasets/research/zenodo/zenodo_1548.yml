  title: Effect of Lime and Organic Matter Additions on Inorganic N-Transformation
    in Soil
  abstract: Depaitment of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra
    Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani-741 235<strong> </strong> <em>Manuscript received
    1 September 1982, revised 4 September 1984, accepted 18 January 1985</em> Comparatively
    higher amount of clay-fixed ammonium and lower amount of exchangeable ammonium
    were observed in the limed over the uniimed soil. Whereas, much lower amount of
    clay-fixed ammonium was observed in the starch added limed than in the corresponding
    unlimed soil. Irrespective of liming, magnitude of fixed ammonium in the starch
    added soil was much less than either the rice straw or no organic matter treated
    soil. It is suggested that the heterotrophic microbes utilised a considerable
    amount of fixed ammonium from the soil resulting a decrease in its amount under
    limed condition.
