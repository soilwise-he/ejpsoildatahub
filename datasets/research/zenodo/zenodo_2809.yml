  title: How will forecasted warming and drought affect soil respiration in savannah
    ecosystems? The role of tree canopy and grazing legacy
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil respiration (R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the most
    important carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, and it is considered as a keystone
    in predicting ecosystem functioning. Changes in climate and land use may alter
    R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, triggering feedbacks between R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and
    other ecosystem components. Different factors might simultaneously alter R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;,
    but the consequences of the interactive effects for ecosystems functioning remain
    poorly understood. Here, the impact of the expected changes in climate were analysed
    in a factorial field study over two consecutive years in a Mediterranean savannah
    ecosystem. We assessed how the interaction of changes in climate with grazing
    legacy and habitat structure influences R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. We simulated
    different climate scenarios (ambient, drier, warmer, and drier and warmer conditions)
    forecasted for the study area at three adjacent sites with different grazing legacies
    (high, medium, and low) and for the two most important habitat types (open grasslands
    and under tree canopy). We also considered other factors that could affect R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;,
    such as soil organic C, microbial biomass or net primary productivity, unravelling
    the direct and indirect effects of the factors controlling R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;over
    time by using structural-equation models (SEMs). Overall, R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;was
    higher under tree canopy than in open grasslands, and high grazing intensity tended
    to alter R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;differently through seasons. Warming scenario
    consistently increased R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, while drought reduced it (especially
    in moist seasons), with a moderate increase of R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;resulting
    from the combination of warming and drought. Tree canopy modulated the impact
    of climate on R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. The SEM analyses identified soil moisture,
    temperature, grazing legacy and canopy as the main factors controlling R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;,
    although they presented seasonal variations in the size and direction of their
    effects. Thus, the projected changes in climate can deeply alter ecosystem functioning
    of carbon sequestration, although their impact can be modulated by canopy cover
    and management activities.&lt;/p&gt;'
