  title: "Reliability of Soil and Ground Improvement Techniques on Peaty Clay Soil\
    \ \u2013 A Review"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Various ground improvement methods have evolved in the last
    decade, these methods seek to improve the shear strength parameters of the soil
    and thus increase the bearing capacity. This paper, presents the reliability of
    the results of improvement techniques on Peaty clay soil, in various locations
    at a 1m depth, using the Unconfined Compressive strength test UCS and the California
    Bearing Ratio test CBR . The major materials used where Chemicals such as Calcium
    Oxide, Calcium Hydroxide, Calcium Chloride, Cement, Aluminum Hydroxide and Sodium
    Silicate and Geo textiles woven soaked, non woven soaked, woven un soaked and
    non woven un soaked for a curing period of 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. Amongst
    the different methods of soil improvement, the use of chemical additives for soil
    stabilization to increase soil strength parameters and loading capacity was found
    to be more reliable. In addition, the above mentioned chemicals increased the
    shear strength of the soil and controls shrinkage swell properties of the soil,
    hence, a reliable technique in improving soil properties. The use of geo textile
    was also found to be a reliable improvement technique because it generates strength
    improvement. Akpila, S. B. | Jaja, G. W. T. &quot;Reliability of Soil and Ground
