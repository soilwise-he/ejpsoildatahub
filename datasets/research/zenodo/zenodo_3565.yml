  title: Evaluation Of Tension Capacity Of Pile (Case Study In Sandy Soil)
  abstract: 'High building constructions are increasing in south

    beaches of the Caspian Sea because of tourist attractions and limitation of residential
    areas. According to saturated alluvial fields transfer of load from high structures
    to the soil by piles is inevitable.

    In spite of most of these piles are under compression forces, tension piles are
    used in special conditions. Few studies have been conducted

    because of the limited use of these piles. Tension capacity of openended pipe
    piles in full scale was tested in this study. The length of the bored piles was
    420 up to 480 cm and all were in 120 cm

    diameter. The results of testing 7 piles were compared with the results of relations
    given by researches.'
