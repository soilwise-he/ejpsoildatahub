  title: Evaluation Of Soil Fertility Agricultural Areas In The Central-Tuva Depression
  abstract: "In the article, the fertility of a soil cover of the agricultural territory\
    \ of Tuva is considered. The structure of agricultural grounds of the region where\
    \ the share of an arable land makes 5% is considered. The main share of an arable\
    \ land is in Central Tuva basin. More than 60% of acreage in the republic are\
    \ concentrated in the central part of the region (Tandinsky, Kaa\u2013Hemsky,\
    \ Pius\u2013Hemsky and Sut-Holsky areas). The reasons for reduction of arable\
    \ land during the considered period are analysed. The maintenance of a humus in\
    \ an arable layer of zone soils is defined. Chestnut soils have the low maintenance\
    \ of a humus, chernozem soils \u2014 an average. For the last 35 years in soils\
    \ of an arable land of Tuva, the maintenance of a humus almost by 1,3 times has\
    \ decreased. It is revealed that during this period in arable soils process of\
    \ a degasification continues. Soil index of aerosols of Tuva very low. The annual\
    \ deficiency of a humus in soils of agricultural use is 845 kg/hectare. It is\
    \ established that organic fertilizers have a positive effect on the increase\
    \ in fertility of aerosols (desiderata, manure). The Tributary on green fertilizer\
    \ leaves the crop residue and root remains in a number of 6,3 t/hectare, peas\
    \ \u2014 5,0 t/hectare, and the greatest number of organic substance comes to\
    \ the soil with manure (12 t/hectare)."
