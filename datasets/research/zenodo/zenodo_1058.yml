  title: Chemical Soil Properties of Four Suburban Farms in Santiago de Cuba
  abstract: '<strong>Context: </strong>Soil is an important resource and it is the
    basis for agricultural forestry exploitation. The chemical properties are linked
    to nutrient availability. Proper research of the soil chemical nature indicators
    is needed to understand soil fertility. <strong>Aim: </strong>To evaluate the
    behavior of some chemical properties of the soil on four suburban farms in Santiago
    de Cuba. <strong>Methods: </strong>The soil was dug to collect samples from every
    soil horizon. After identification, the samples were taken to the laboratories
    of Oriente Geomining Company. The contents of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), magnesium
    (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), aluminum (Al<sup>3+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), and potassium
    (K<sup>+</sup>) were determined, along with the cationic ratios, the pH, the effective
    cationic exchange capacity (CICe), base saturation percentage (V), the saturation
    associated with CICe, and the organic matter (M.O.) <strong>Results: </strong>The
    Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> contents underwent a variable
    behavior, whereas Al<sup>3+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> behaved similarly, in all
    the cases above the soil permissibility limits. The pH was the least variable
    property, above 7, the V value in all the cases surpassed 85%, and CICe was above
    50 cmol.Kg<sup>-1</sup>. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/MG<sup>2+</sup> showed a favorable
    balance, Na<sup>+</sup> saturation was high, and the O.M. content was generally
    low. <strong>Conclusions: </strong>The chemical properties of the farm soils analyzed
    were a constraining factor to the development of production. Despite the potential
    fertility and proper nutrient contents, the ratios between the elements makes
    them so fixed in the soil in forms that cannot be assimilated by the crops.'
