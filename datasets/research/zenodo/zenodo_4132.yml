  title: "Mineral Nitrogen Retention, Nitrogen Availability And Plant Growth In The\
    \ Soil Influenced By Addition Of Organic And Mineral Fertilizers \u2013 Lysimetric\
    \ Experiment"
  abstract: "Compost can influence soil fertility and plant health. At the same time\
    \ compost can play an important role in the nitrogen cycle and it can influence\
    \ leaching of mineral nitrogen from soil to underground water.\n\nThis paper deals\
    \ with the influence of compost addition and mineral nitrogen fertilizer on leaching\
    \ of mineral nitrogen, nitrogen availability in microbial biomass and plant biomass\
    \ production in the lysimetric experiment. Twenty one lysimeters were filed with\
    \ topsoil and subsoil collected in the area of protection zone of underground\
    \ source of drinking water - B\u0159ezov\xE1 nad Svitavou. The highest leaching\
    \ of mineral nitrogen was detected in the variant fertilized only mineral nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer (624.58 mg m<sup>-2</sup>), the lowest leaching was recorded in the\
    \ variant with high addition of compost (315.51 mg m<sup>-2</sup>). On the other\
    \ hand, losses of mineral nitrogen are not in connection with the losses of available\
    \ form of nitrogen in microbial biomass. Because lost of mineral nitrogen was\
    \ detected in variant with the least change in the availability of N in microbial\
    \ biomass.\n\nThe leaching of mineral nitrogen, yields as well as the results\
    \ concerning nitrogen availability from the first year of long term experiment\
    \ suggest that compost can positive influence the leaching of nitrogen into underground\
    \ water."
