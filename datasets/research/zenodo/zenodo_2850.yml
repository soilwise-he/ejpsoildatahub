  title: Opposing effects of floral visitors and soil conditions on the determinants
    of competitive outcomes maintain species diversity in heterogeneous landscapes
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Theory argues that both soil conditions and aboveground trophic\
    \ interactions have equivalent potential to limit or promote plant diversity.\
    \ However, it remains unexplored how they jointly modify the niche differences\
    \ stabilising species coexistence and the average fitness differences driving\
    \ competitive dominance. We conducted a field study in Mediterranean annual grasslands\
    \ to parameterise population models of six competing plant species. Spatially\
    \ explicit floral visitor assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterised\
    \ for each species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species population\
    \ dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect changes in competitive\
    \ responses. Although the magnitude and sign of these changes were species\u2010\
    specific, floral visitors promoted coexistence at neighbourhood scales, while\
    \ soil salinity did so over larger scales by changing the superior competitors&rsquo;\
    \ identity. Our results show how below and aboveground interactions maintain diversity\
    \ in heterogeneous landscapes through their opposing effects on the determinants\
    \ of competitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;"
