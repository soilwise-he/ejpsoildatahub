  title: 'EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SOIL EROSION: A REPORT'
  abstract: Climate change refers to the changing Earths climatic system lasting from
    over a few decades to millions of years. The formation of soil is a complex and
    a long process involving the multifarious interaction of the number of forces
    viz relief, climate, parent material, organisms all acting over time. Climate
    is one of the most important factors affecting the formation of soil with important
    implications for their development, use and management perspective with reference
    to soil structure, stability, topsoil water holding capacity, nutrient availability
    and erosion. Assuming constant inputs of carbon to soils from vegetation, different
    estimate predicts that expected changes in temperature, precipitation and evaporation
    will cause significant change in organic matter turnover and CO<sub>2</sub> dynamics.
    In conclusion, increased productivity would generally lead to greater inputs of
    carbon to soil, thus increasing organic matter in soil.
