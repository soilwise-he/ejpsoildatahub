  title: Soil Stabilization by using Lime
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Lime is a calcium- containing inorganic mineral in which carbonates,
    oxides, and hydroxides predominate. In the strict sense of the term, lime is calcium
    oxide or calcium hydroxide. It is also the name of the natural mineral (native
    lime) CaO which occurs as a product of coal seam fires and in altered limestone
    xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The word lime originates with its earliest use as
    building mortar and has the sense of sticking or adhering. These materials are
    still used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including
    limestone product cement, concrete, mortar) as chemical feedstocks and for sugar
    refining, among other uses. Lime industries and the use of many of the resulting
    products date from prehistoric times in both the old world and the new world.
    Lime is used extensively for waste water treatment with ferrous sulphate made
    to observe the effectiveness of stabilizing agent lime in improving various engineering
    properties of soil like liquid lime, plastic limit, plasticity index Black cotton
    soil is a highly clayey soil. In general, all lime treated fine-grained soil exhibit
    decrease plasticity, improved workability and reduce volume change characteristics.
    However, not all soil exhibit improved strength characteristics. It should be
    emphasized that the properties of soil lime mixtures are dependent on many variables.
    Soil type, lime type, lime percentage and curing conditions (time, temperature)
    It has been observed that CBR values increased with lime content, for black cotton
    soil. It is observed that value increased significantly after addition of lime
    content. The stabilized soil can be used as subgrade, sub base and base course
    without aggregate. The test result indicates that lime may be used to save natural
    resources like aggregate and murum&lt;/p&gt;'
