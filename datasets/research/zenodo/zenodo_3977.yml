  title: Improvement of Black Soybean Performances with Application of Bio-Nano Orthosilicic
    Acid on Acid Dry Land Soil
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br> Soybean is one of the major food commodities\
    \ in Indonesia, but the production<br> of soybean itself is still low in the last\
    \ five years. As an effort to fulfill the needs of<br> domestic soybean, marginal\
    \ land soil could be utilized for black soybean, however its<br> challenge is\
    \ generally infertile soils. One of marginal land soil that can be used is acid<br>\
    \ dry land (ADL) soil characterized by low organic matter content and pH value.\
    \ The<br> objective of this study was to determine the effect of application of\
    \ bio\u2010nano\u2010silica in the<br> form orthosilicic acid (OSA) in acid dry\
    \ land soil on : (i) black soybean vegetative<br> growth and (ii) black soybean\
    \ yield. The research was conducted in Natar area, South<br> Lampung, in July\u2010\
    October 2017, by using a randomized block design with three<br> replicates. Bio\u2010\
    nano OSA was applied at 0, 2, 4, and 6 L/ha, whereas single N, P, and K<br> fertilizers\
    \ were given at 0, 50, 75, and 100% of recommended rate on a 100 m2 plot size<br>\
    \ each, with control plot and farmer\u2019s standard practice plot (100% N, P,\
    \ and K + 2ton/ha<br> of organic matter). Bio\u2010nano OSA was prepared from\
    \ a 325\u2010mesh quartz sand using<br> acid base solution extraction method and\
    \ contained 5% H4SiO4 with 18 nm particle size<br> applied in combination with\
    \ selected Si\u2010solubilizing microorganism, i.e. Aeromonas<br> punctata, Burkholderia\
    \ cenocepacia, B. vietnamiensis, and Aspergillus niger. The results<br> indicated\
    \ that the application of bio\u2010nano OSA at 4 L/ha was able to save NPK fertilizer<br>\
    \ dosages up to 50% fertilizer and improved both vegetative and yield performances\
    \ of<br> Detam\u20101 black soybean variety on Ultisols of Natar."
