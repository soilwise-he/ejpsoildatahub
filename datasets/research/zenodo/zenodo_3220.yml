  title: Calculation Of The Climatic Indicator For The Electronic Map Of Soil-Ecological
    Estimation Of The Western Siberia Taiga Zone Lands (In The Borders Of The Nizhnevartovsk
    District).
  abstract: "The article is devoted to the methodological substantiation of the creation\
    \ of an attributive block and an electronic map of soil\u2013ecological assessment\
    \ of lands within the Nizhnevartovsk region. The stages and methods of creating\
    \ an attributive database and a digital map of soil\u2013ecological assessment\
    \ are described. The soil\u2013ecological assessment was carried out for the taiga\
    \ zone of Western Siberia, the construction of an attributive block of soil formation\
    \ factors is the most important component of the digital soil mapping database,\
    \ reflects the soil indices of own research and analyzed archival climatic data\
    \ from the GISmeteo portal for Nizhnevartovsk. The results obtained in the course\
    \ of the work can be taken into account when solving design and land management\
    \ tasks, in agro\u2013industrial production, the development of integrated schemes\
    \ for spatial planning, as well as addressing issues of rational land use."
