  title: Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor Node for IoT in Agriculture and Home
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Growing food for nine billion people is a challenge we will
    face in near future. Digital technologies hold a great promise to increase efficiency
    and use resources effectively. In this paper we present a low-power and scalable
    IoT-based architecture for home farmers and scientific purposes that enables to
    verify the environmental impact on plants developments by monitoring the soil
    moisture and temperature. The measured values are transmitted via Bluetooth Low
    Energy (BLE) to a gateway, e.g., a smartphone running the gateway app, to a cloud
    platform that stores and processes the data. This data is useful to give home
    farmers vital information, e.g., when to water a plant or when the plant is prune
    to get infected by a disease. This information is of great importance because
    it helps to decrease crop failures and thus farm more efficient. The hardware
    and software architecture presented is scalable&lt;br&gt;

    and designed to consume low power. Experiments show that it is possible to create
    a high-spatial resolution by putting many sensor nodes on a small area, in order
    to help research to measure micro-climate.&lt;/p&gt;'
