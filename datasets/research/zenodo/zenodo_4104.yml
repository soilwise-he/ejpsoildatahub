  title: Estimatethe Concentration Of Heavy Metals In Soil By Using  Trigonometric
    Cubic B-Spline Method And Its Application In Baghdad, Iraq
  abstract: "The aims of this paper, is to estimate the concentration of heavy metals\
    \ such cadmium, copper, nickel,lead, and zincin soilby using trigonometric cubic\
    \ B-spline collocation method. In this work the usual finite difference scheme\
    \ is applied to discretize the time derivative. Trigonometric cubic B-spline basis\
    \ functions are used as aninterpolating function in the space dimension.Whereas\
    \ the result is the concentration of heavy metals. This method is also suggested\
    \ to estimate the concentration of heavy metals such cadmium, copper, nickel,\
    \ lead, and zinc in soil of Baghdad city, Iraq. Thus we can estimate the contamination\
    \ in soil by heavy metals. The result showed that the proposed method can successfully\
    \ estimate the concentration of heavy metals in soilfor any depth.\n\n \n\nKeywords:\
    \ Trigonometric cubic B-spline basis functions, Cubic trigonometric B-spline collocation\
    \ method Soil contamination, Heavy metals, Soil property."
