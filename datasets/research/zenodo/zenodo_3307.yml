  title: Thermal Technologies Applications For Soil Remediation
  abstract: This paper discusses the importance of having a good initial characterization
    of soil samples when thermal desorption has to be applied to polluted soils for
    the removal of contaminants. Particular attention has to be devoted on the desorption
    kinetics of the samples to identify the gases evolved during the heating, and
    contaminant degradation pathways. In this study, two samples coming from different
    points of the same contaminated site were considered. The samples are much different
    from each other. Moreover, the presence of high initial quantity of heavy hydrocarbons
    strongly affected the performance of thermal desorption, resulting in formation
    of dangerous intermediates. Analytical techniques such TGA (Thermogravimetric
    Analysis), DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass)
    provided a good support to give correct indication for field application.
