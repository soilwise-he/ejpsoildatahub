  title: The Comparison Of Some Soil Quality Indexes In Different Land Uses Of Ghareh
    Aghaj Watershed Of Semirom, Isfahan, Iran
  abstract: 'Land use change, if not based on proper scientific

    investigation affects other physical, chemical, and biological

    properties of soil and leading to increased destruction and erosion. It

    was imperative to study the effects of changing rangelands to

    farmlands on some Soil quality indexes. Undisturbed soil samples

    were collected from the depths of 0-10 and 10-30 centimeter in

    pasture with good vegetation cover(GP), pasture with medium

    vegetation cover(MP), abandoned dry land farming(ADF) and

    degraded dry land farming(DDF) land uses in Ghareh Aghaj

    watershed of Isfahan province. The results revealed that organic

    matter(OM), cation exchange capacity(CEC) and available

    potassium(AK) decreasing in the depth of 0-10 centimeter were 66.6,

    38.8 and 70 percent and in the depth of 10-30 centimeter were 58,

    61.4 and 83.5 percent respectively in DDF comparison with GP.

    Concerning to the results, it seems that land use change can decrease

    soil quality and increase soil degradation and lead in undesirable

    consequences.'
