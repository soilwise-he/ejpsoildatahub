  title: 'Zero-Tillage Effects on Durum Wheat Productivity and Soil-Related Variables
    in Future Climate Scenarios: A Modeling Analysis'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Adoption of zero-tillage practices with residue retention in
    field crops has been introduced as an alternative soil-management technique to
    counteract the resource degradation and high production costs derived from intensive
    tillage. In this sense, the biophysical models are valuable tools to evaluate
    and design the most suitable soil-management technique in view of future climate
    variability. The aim of this study was to use the ARMOSA process-based crop model
    to perform an assessment of tillage (T) and no-tillage (No-T) practices of durum-wheat-cropping
    systems in the Campania region (South of Italy) under current and future climate
    scenarios. First, the model was calibrated using measurements of soil water content
    at different depths, leaf area index, and aboveground biomass in the T and No-T
    treatments during the 2013&ndash;2014 season. Then, the model was further applied
    in the T and No-T treatments to future climate data for 2020&ndash;2100 that was
    generated by the COSMO-CLM model using the RCP4.5 and 8.5 paths. Results of the
    calibration depicted that the model can accurately simulate the soil-crop-related
    variables of both soil-management treatments, and thus can be applied to identify
    the most appropriate conservation agricultural practices in the durum-wheat system.
    The simulation of soil water content at different depths resulted in small relative
    root mean square errors (RRMSE &lt; 15%) and an acceptable Pearson&rsquo;s correlation
    coefficient (r &gt; 0.51); and the goodness-of-fit indicators for simulated LAI
    and AGB resulted in acceptable RRMSE (RRMSE &lt; 28%), and high r (r &gt; 0.84)
    in both soil-management treatments. Future climate simulations showed that No-T
    management will deliver 10% more wheat yield than the T, with an annual average
    0.31% year&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;increase of soil organic carbon,
    and an increase of 3.80% year&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;for N uptake,
    which can diminish the N leaching. These results suggest that No-T could be implemented
    as a more resilient management for farming system in view of climate uncertainty
    and scarcity of resources. Therefore, these findings support the potential of
    the ARMOSA model to evaluate the soil-crop response of the durum-wheat system
    under different management conditions and to design appropriate soil-management
    practices for current and future climate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;'
