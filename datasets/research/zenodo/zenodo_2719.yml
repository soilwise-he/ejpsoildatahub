  title: Assessment of Soil Properties for Flood Vulnerability Zones in Parts of Obio/Akpor
    Local Government Area, Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "This study is aimed at assessing soil properties on flood sensitive areas\
    \ in parts of Obio-Akpor Local Government Area, Port Harcourt Metropolis, Rivers\
    \ State, Nigeria. Field studies involved soil sampling while laboratory analysis\
    \ involved particle size distribution, moisture content determination and hydraulic\
    \ conductivity estimation. Geotechnical analysis revealed that the soils predominantly\
    \ composed of silty clay, fine sandy silty clay and silty clayey sands. On average,\
    \ moisture content and permeability are 27% and 2.8x10-6 cm/sec, and 20.41% and\
    \ 1.3x10-3 cm/sec in Rumuigbo and Ozuoba areas, respectively. The soil properties\
    \ were not significantly different from those obtained from one of the control\
    \ sites. Although the soil characteristics at the control site and flood prone\
    \ areas were similar, flooding does not occur at control sites because they are\
    \ located at a higher topography compared with the flood prone areas located on\
    \ a shallow topography. These results are confirmed by the high annual rainfall\
    \ (2198.73 mm/hr on average) that occurs on average round the year in Rivers State.\
    \ The buildings in these flood prone areas were constructed with concrete and\
    \ blocks which are susceptible to cracking and failure when constantly immersed\
    \ in water for prolonged time. It is therefore recommended that large sloping\
    \ gutters be constructed within strategic places in the area in order to properly\
    \ transport water to the nearby rivers and ensure that dumpsites around flood\
    \ prone areas are evacuated to prevent contaminated water from recharging the\
    \ aquifer. \xA9 International Journal of Ground Sediment &amp; Water, \xA9Sun\
