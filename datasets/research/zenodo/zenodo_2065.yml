  title: Influence Of The Sugar-Loving Ant, Camponotus Compressus (Fabricius, 1787)
    On Soil Physico-Chemical Characteristics
  abstract: <strong>The present study focuses on the physico-chemical characteristics
    of the nest rim debris soil of a common, abundant, plant-visiting ant, <em>Camponotus
    compressus</em></strong> <strong>(Fabricius, 1787)</strong><strong>. The results
    reveal that the colonies influence the nutrient content and the texture of the
    debris soil. The nest debris had significantly higher proportion of large-sized
    soil particles, along with higher total N, P, NO<sub>3</sub>-N, and moisture content
    but lower concentrations of total C and NH<sub>4</sub>-N as compared to the control
    soil. <em>Camponotus compressus</em> nests annually contributed about 3.1361 Kg
    of C, 1.5482 Kg of N, 0.05853 Kg of P, 0.14457 Kg of NO<sub>3</sub>-N and 0.1744
    Kg of NH<sub>4</sub>-N per hectare via the debris soil of the long-lived primary
    nests. The short-lived satellite nests contributed, 1.7868 Kg of C, 0.7955 Kg
    of N, 0.0318 Kg of P, 0.0559 Kg NO<sub>3</sub>-N and 0.09623 Kg of NH<sub>4</sub>-N
    per hectare, annually. Thus, the activities of <em>C.</em> <em>compressus</em>
    colonies contribute to soil nutrient enhancement, alter the soil particle size
    distribution, shift the soil pH towards neutral and through their frequent satellite
    nest construction activities and enhance soil porosity.  Since <em>C.</em> <em>compressus</em>
    is abundant in a variety of ecosystems including annual cropping systems, its
    nesting activities are suggested to enhance ecosystem productivity.</strong>
