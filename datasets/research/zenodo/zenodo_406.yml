  title: SOIL HEALTH CHECKUP FOR BETTER CROP PRODUCTIVITY
  abstract: Healthy soils produce healthy crops that in turn nourish people and animals.
    It is the foundation of the food system. Soil testing is a well recognized scientific
    method for quick characterization of the soil fertility status and prediction
    of crop nutrient requirement which are lost through improper use of fertilizers,
    continuous cropping, erosion, leaching, volatilization, denitrification and fixation.
    Soil Health Card (SHC) is a Government of Indias scheme which apart from giving
    the health index of soil &amp; also indicates fertilizer recommendations and soil
    amendment required for the farm. Knowing the fertility status of soil before sowing
    of crop will lead to proper usage &amp; dosage of appropriate fertilizer, thus
    maintaining the essential nutrients profile &amp; OC status for optimal crop productivity.
