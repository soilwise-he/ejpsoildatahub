  title: "Can We Use Satellite-Based Soil-Moisture Products at High Resolution to\
    \ Investigate Land-Use Differences and Land\u2013Atmosphere Interactions? A Case\
    \ Study in the Savanna"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The use of soil moisture (SM) measurements from satellites has
    grown in recent years, fostering the development of new products at high resolution.
    This opens the possibility of using them for certain applications that were normally
    carried out using in situ data. We investigated this hypothesis through two main
    analyses using two high-resolution satellite-based soil moisture (SBSM) products
    that combined microwave with thermal and optical data: (1) The Disaggregation
    based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) and, (2) The Soil Moisture
    Ocean Salinity-Barcelona Expert Center (SMOS-BEC Level 4). We used these products
    to analyse the SM differences among pixels with contrasting vegetation. This was
    done through the comparison of the SM measurements from satellites and the measurements
    simulated with a simple antecedent precipitation index (API) model, which did
    not account for the surface characteristics. Subsequently, the deviation of the
    SM from satellite with respect to the API model (bias) was analysed and compared
    for contrasting land use categories. We hypothesised that the differences in the
    biases of the varied categories could provide information regarding the water
    retention capacity associated with each type of vegetation. From the satellite
    measurements, we determined how the SM depended on the tree cover, i.e., the denser
    the tree cover, the higher the SM. However, in winter periods with light rain
    events, the tree canopy could dampen the moistening of the soil through interception
    and conducted higher SM in the open areas. This evolution of the SM differences
    that depended on the characteristics of each season was observed both from satellite
    and from in situ measurements taken beneath a tree and in grass on the savanna
    landscape. The agreement between both types of measurements highlighted the potential
    of the SBSM products to investigate the SM of each type of vegetation. We found
    that the results were clearer for DISPATCH, whose data was not smoothed spatially
    as it was in SMOS-BEC. We also tested whether the relationships between SM and
    evapotranspiration could be investigated using satellite data. The answer to this
    question was also positive but required removing the unrealistic high-frequency
    SM oscillations from the satellite data using a low pass filter. This improved
    the performance scores of the products and the agreement with the results from
    the in situ data. These results demonstrated the possibility of using SM data
    from satellites to substitute ground measurements for the study of land&ndash;atmosphere
    interactions, which encourages efforts to improve the quality and resolution of
    these measurements.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
