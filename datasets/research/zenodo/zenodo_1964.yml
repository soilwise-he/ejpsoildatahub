  title: 'Bearing Capacity of Isolated Square Skirted Foundation on Cohesionless Soil:
    An Experimental and Analytical Study'
  abstract: "Skirted foundations are being used increasingly for foundations of offshore\
    \ structures, the popular name of that foundations is bucket foundations. The\
    \ provision of skirts on the periphery of shallow foundation will result in increasing\
    \ confinement of soil and hence improvement in state of stress as well as soil\
    \ structure interaction. The present paper describes study of model square skirted\
    \ foundation for axial loads in cohesionless soils. The parameters like aspect\
    \ ratio of skirt (skirt length), skirt angle \u03B1, depth of placement of foundation\
    \ are considered in experiments and compared with model plane footing without\
    \ skirts. Bearing capacity of the model foundations were carried out by stress\
    \ controlled plate load test. Results shows considerable increase in bearing capacity\
    \ because of provision of skirts, hence skirted foundations is suitable for on\
    \ shore structures also. The governing mechanism for the behaviour of skirted\
    \ foundations is explained."
