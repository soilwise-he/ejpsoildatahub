  title: Influence of organic fertilizers on changes in soil properties under open
    and protected cultivation practices
  abstract: An experiment conducted to evaluate the influence of different organic
    manure on soil properties under glasshouse and open field condition at Khumaltar,
    Lalitpur during 2017-2018 showed insignificant results on major soil properties
    by the application of different organic manure under open and protected environmental
    condition at varying sampling days. The experiment was laid out in Complete Randomized
    Design (CRD) with three replications and six treatments viz. Vermicompost (VC)
    @ 10:1 gkg-1 of soil (T1), FYM @ 10:1 gkg-1 of soil (T2), Poultry Manure (PM)
    @ 10:1 gkg-1 of soil (T3), Safal Kishan (SK) @ 10:1 gkg-1 of soil (T4), Nepalese
    Organic Fertilizer (NOF) @ 10:1 gkg-1 of soil (T5) and Control (T6). Application
    of poultry manure and Safal kisan under glasshouse condition recorded higher organic
    matter (6.40 %) at 90 days and application of poultry manure under open condition
    at 30 days recorded higher total Nitrogen Content (0.53%). Application of vermicompost
    and poultry manure under open condition at 60 days have highest available Phosphorous
    content (381 kgha-1), whereas application of poultry manure under open condition
    at 60 days was observed having highest available potassium content (782 kgha-1)
    in the soil.
