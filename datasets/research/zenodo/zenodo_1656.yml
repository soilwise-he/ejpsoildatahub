  title: Optimization of bio-surfactant production by Azo-rhizobium strain isolated
    from oil-contaminated soil
  abstract: "Bio-surfactants are amphiphilic molecules possessing both hydrophilic\
    \ and hydrophobic moieties. They are surface active agents that are produced extracellularly\
    \ or as a part of the cell membrane by bacteria, yeast, and fungi. In the present\
    \ study, the screening and optimization of bio-surfactant production were carried\
    \ out using oil-contaminated soil sample. The cultural, morphological and biochemical\
    \ tests as well as 16s rRNA analysis identified the most efficient bio-surfactant\
    \ producer as <em>Azorhizobium</em> strain. The preliminary screening of bio-surfactant\
    \ production was done with the help of oil displacement test, drop collapse test\
    \ and observed hemolysis on superimposed blood agar plates. Optimization studies\
    \ revealed that 2% inoculum size of test strain (1.0 O.D 530 nm) can be exploited\
    \ for bio-surfactant production using 2% coconut oil and ammonium nitrate with\
    \ a C: N ratio of 20:1 in MSM medium (pH 8.5) and incubation conditions of 30\
    \ \u02DAC for 96 h. The crude yield of bio-surfactant produced was estimated as\
    \ 2.5 g/L. Further purification of crude bio-surfactant was carried out using\
    \ acid hydrolysis and rotary vacuum evaporator. The bio-surfactant thus obtained\
    \ successfully reduced the surface tension of the medium from 59 mN/m to 38 mN/m\
    \ with E<sub>24 </sub>60%. The characterization studies of the purified bio-surfactant\
    \ carried out by FTIR analysis confirmed it to be lipopolysaccharide type of bio-surfactant.\
    \ Thus our current study suggests useful application of bio-surfactant producing\
    \ bacterial strain that may be helpful in the petroleum industry for the purpose\
    \ of recovery of petroleum and other oils from oily sludge, cleaning of oil storage\
    \ tanks and bioremediation of oil-contaminated sites."
