  title: The influence of fertilizers on the behavior of fluoride fractions in the
    alkaline soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;It has been established that fluoride bioavailability in the soil is
    defined by the form which it exists rather than the amount of total fluoride.
    In the soil, fluoride exist in different fractions such as water soluble (Ws-F),
    Exchangeable (Ex-F), bound to iron/manganese (Fe/Mn-F), organic matter bound (Or-F),
    and the residual (Res-F). All of these fractions are bioavailable however to different
    extents in an order Ws-F&gt;Ex-F&gt;Fe/Mn-F&gt;Or-F&gt;Res-F. Agricultural practices
    such as fertilizer application alters the behavior of these fractions which further
    affects fluoride bioavailability in the soil. This study investigated the influence
    of the three commonly used fertilizers (Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Urea, and
    cow-manure) on the bioavailability of soil fluoride in an alkaline soil. The soil
    was mixed with either one of the fertilizers then incubated for a period of five
    months. All three fertilizers increased the amount of Ws-F by 7.8 &plusmn; 0.6,
    4.1 &plusmn; 0.2, 9.6 &plusmn; 1.1 mg/kg and Fe/Mn-F by 2.24 &plusmn; 0.3, 0.44
    &plusmn; 0.2, and 2.1 &plusmn; 0.2 mg/kg, for DAP, Urea, and manure amendments,
    respectively, but had no impact on the amount of Or-F. All three fertilizers were
    observed to enhance the bioavailability of fluoride in the soil by increasing
    the amount of Ws-F. The fertilizers could have increased the bioavailability of
    fluoride in the soil directly or indirectly through alteration of pH and the soil
    elemental composition. The three fertilizers might not be suitable for use in
    fluoride contaminated alkaline soils as they accelerate fluoride release and hence
    bioavailability in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
