  title: Comparative Analysis of Some Geotechnical Properties of Decomposed Solid
    Waste and Natural Soil Site for Foundation Engineering
  abstract: Optimization of landfills as a result of increasing population and demand
    for infrastructural development has necessitated intensified investigation among
    engineers. Examining the engineering properties of soils from these landfills
    is of great concern. This paper presented the bearing capacity of soils from dump
    sites of municipal solid wastes and natural soil using their shear strength parameters
    obtained from direct shear tests, after preliminary tests had been carried out
    to determine index properties of the soil samples. Samples were obtained at 1m,
    1.5m, 2m, 2.5m and 3m depth from Jettu site in Edo State, Nigeria. The maximum
    and least cohesion values were observed to be 24kN/m2 and 17kN/m2, 15kN/m2 and
    5kN/m2; and the maximum angles of internal-friction were 22oC and 24oC, while
    the least internal friction angles were 6oC and 9oC for NS and SWSS samples respectively,
    which denotes that the samples are fine soils with good shear strength and can
    serve as reliable structural foundation materials
