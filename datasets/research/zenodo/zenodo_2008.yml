  title: Method validation and fungicide residue analysis of grain, straw and soil
    substrates in rice ecosystem
  abstract: Rice (Oryzae sativa) is an important, nutritional staple food for majority
    of the global population. Non-judicious and widespread use of fungicides by farmers
    had lead to environmental contamination posing serious threat to human and animal
    health, thus resulting in rejection of Indian rice consignments by the European
    Union and the USA. Hence fungicides effective against sheath blight of rice under
    field conditions were analyzed for their residue content in substrates like paddy
    grains, straw and soil. Calibration curve was plotted and linearity of the method
    was established with a Correlation Coefficient range from 0.9992 to 0.9999 for
    all the six fungicides. Results showed that all the fungicides had recoveries
    between the range of 70-120% in all the substrates at three fortification levels.
    Hence it can be concluded that this analytical method was suitable for residue
    analysis of these fungicides in different rice matrices. When the treated samples
    were analyzed, residue content was noticed but most of them showed Below Limit
    of Detection (BLOD) except few recorded Below Limit of Quantification (BLOQ).
    It means that even though the residues were detected for few compounds, they were
    unable to be quantified. Hence, these fungicides are a good fit for management
    of sheath blight of rice with no residual toxicity.
