  title: Examination Of The Water And Nutrient Utilization Of Maize Hybrids On Chernozem
    Soil
  abstract: "The research was set up on chernozem soil at the L\xE1t\xF3k\xE9p AGTC\
    \ M\xC9K research area of the University of Debrecen in Hungary. We examined the\
    \ yield, the yield production per 1kg NPK fertilizer and the water and nutrient\
    \ utilization of hybrid PR37N01 and PR37M81 in 2013. We found that PR37N01 produced\
    \ the most yield at the level of N<sub>120</sub>+P (17,476kg ha<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ while PR37M81 reached the highest yield at level N<sub>150</sub>+PK (16,754kg\
    \ ha<sup>-1</sup>). Studies related to yield production per 1kg NPK indicated\
    \ that the best results were achieved at level N<sub>30</sub>+PK compared to the\
    \ control treatment. Yield production per 1kg NPK was17.6kg kg<sup>-1</sup> by\
    \ P37N01 and 44.2kg kg<sup>-1</sup> by PR37M81. By comparing the water utilization\
    \ of hybrids we found that the worst water utilization results were reached in\
    \ the control treatment (PR37N01: 26.2kg mm<sup>-1</sup>, PR37M81: 19.5kg mm<sup>-1</sup>).\
    \ The best water utilization values were produced at level N<sub>120</sub>+PK\
    \ in the case of hybrid PR37N01 (32.1kg mm<sup>-1</sup>) and at N<sub>150</sub>+PK\
    \ in the case of hybrid PR37M81 (30.8kg mm<sup>-1</sup>). We established the values\
    \ of the nutrient reaction and the fertilizer optimum of hybrids. We discovered\
    \ a strong relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied and the yield\
    \ produced (r<sup>2</sup>= 0.8228\u20130.9515). The best nutrient response was\
    \ induced by hybrid PR37N01, while the weakest results were reached by hybrid\
    \ PR37M81."
