  title: 'Soil Evangelization: Learning From School Cocoyam Project in Southeast Nigeria'
  abstract: "Soil evangelization, an awareness campaign to attract youths to study\
    \ soil science and address soil fertility challenges to sustainable crop production\
    \ was extended to two primary and two secondary schools, respectively, in Southeast\
    \ Nigeria, participating in school cocoyam project (SCP), under the aegis of cocoyam\
    \ re-birth initiative of the National Root Crops Research Institute, Umudike.\
    \ The aim was to develop the capacity of the youths for soil fertility recapitalization\
    \ and very rapid multiplication of cocoyam. The approach involved participatory\
    \ result demonstration of Gocken Rapid Multiplication Technology using micro cormels\
    \ and micro setts of \u2264 7 g of cocoyam, planted on a 5 m x 4 m plot in each\
    \ location at 50,000 plants/ha. Organic and inorganic fertilizers were applied.\
    \ Results showed that there were 14.2. 50.0, 55.8, 48.5 and 58.3 % improvements\
    \ in soil pH, total N, organic matter and exchangeable K, respectively, over the\
    \ initial soil nutrient status. Total corm + cormel yields ranged from 14.5 \u2013\
    \ 19.7 t/ha. The highest significant (p = \u2264 0.05) yield (19.7 t/ha) was obtained\
    \ at Okposi while the lowest yield (14.5 t/ha) was obtained at Abua Kingdom. Seed\
    \ harvest multiplication ratio (SHMR) ranged from 25 \u2013 35. It was concluded\
    \ that the SCP is a proven strategy to promote soil evangelization and cocoyam\
    \ production."
