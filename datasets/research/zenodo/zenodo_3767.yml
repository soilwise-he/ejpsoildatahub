  title: The Effect of Sewage Sludge Applied to Vetch + Barley Mixture on Some Soil
    Properties
  abstract: Abstract This study was carried out to determine the effect of sewage
    sludge applied to vetch + barley mixture on some soil properties. The research
    was conducted in a randomized complete block design in four replications in the
    experimental fields of Ege University, Faculty of Agriculture in Bornova for two
    years in 2015 and 2016. In research beside control and mineral fertilizer 10,
    20 and 30 t ha-1 treated sludge was applied into the soil. In trial pH, EC, organic
    matter and calcitic lime were investigated. Although the application affected
    pH and salinity in both years, organic matter was affected in the first year of
    study. Applications had no affect on calcitic lime. As a result of study, it is
    seen that sewage sludge applications decreased pH and increased organic matter
    and soil salinity.
