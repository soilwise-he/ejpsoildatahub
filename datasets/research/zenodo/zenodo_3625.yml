  title: WASTE LATERITIC SOIL-LIME-PERSEAMACRANTHA INTERACTION STUDIES FOR OPTIMISATION
    OF THEIR PROPORTIONS
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong> The weathering of laterite occurs in tropical\
    \ or subtropical areas. In lateritic soil about 20\u201330% of the soil waste\
    \ produced during quarrying operations using cutting equipment to recover laterite\
    \ stones must be properly disposed of in the conventional construction blocks\
    \ manufacturing process. Stabilization of lateritic making use of environmentally\
    \ friendly raw materials including lime, and Persea macrantha tree bark extract.\
    \ The application of Persea macrantha in soil stabilization is highlighted in\
    \ this research."
