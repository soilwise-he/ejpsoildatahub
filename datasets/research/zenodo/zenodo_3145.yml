  title: Community metabarcoding reveals the relative role of environmental filtering
    and spatial processes in metacommunity dynamics of soil microarthropods across
    a mosaic of montane forests
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Disentangling the relative role of environmental filtering and
    spatial processes in driving metacommunity structure across mountainous regions
    remains challenging, as the way we quantify spatial connectivity in topographically
    and environmentally heterogeneous landscapes can influence our perception of which
    process predominates. More empirical data sets are required to account for taxon-
    and context-dependency, but relevant research in understudied areas is often compromised
    by the taxonomic impediment. Here we used haplotype-level community DNA metabarcoding,
    enabled by stringent filtering of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), to characterize
    metacommunity structure of soil microarthropod assemblages across a mosaic of
    five forest habitats on the Troodos mountain range in Cyprus. We found similar
    &beta; diversity patterns at ASV and species (OTU, operational taxonomic unit)
    levels, which pointed to a primary role of habitat filtering resulting in the
    existence of largely distinct metacommunities linked to different forest types.
    Within-habitat turnover was correlated to topoclimatic heterogeneity, again emphasizing
    the role of environmental filtering. However, when integrating landscape matrix
    information for the highly fragmented&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Quercus alnifolia&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;habitat,
    we also detected a major role of spatial isolation determined by patch connectivity,
    indicating that stochastic and niche-based processes synergistically govern community
    assembly. Alpha diversity patterns varied between ASV and OTU levels, with OTU
    richness decreasing with elevation and ASV richness following a longitudinal gradient,
    potentially reflecting a decline of genetic diversity eastwards due to historical
    pressures. Our study demonstrates the utility of haplotype-level community metabarcoding
    for characterizing metacommunity structure of complex assemblages and improving
    our understanding of biodiversity dynamics across mountainous landscapes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;'
