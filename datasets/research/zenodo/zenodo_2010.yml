  title: Photometric Determination of Trace Amount of Nitrate in Soil and Plant Samples
    with Sulphosalicylic Acid
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, University of Burdwan, Burdwan-713 104<br> <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 30 January 1984, accepted 8 November 1984</em> Sulfosalicylic acid\
    \ gives a better sensitivity for the determination of nitrate in comparison to\
    \ phenol-disulphonic acid. The sensitivity of the present method is 0.012 <em>\xB5\
    </em>g<em> </em>nitrate cm<sup>-2</sup>. Beer's law is obeyed over the range 0.12\
    \ -16.30 ppm with r.s.d.\xB1 0.12%. Tolerance limits, interferences and removal\
    \ of different foreign ions have been studied. The method was employed for the\
    \ analysis of nitrate in various soil and plant samples. The nitration product\
    \ of sulphosalicylic acid has been isolated and characterised."
