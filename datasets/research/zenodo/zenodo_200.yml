  title: SOIL CONSERVATION TILLAGE IN CROP PRODUCTION
  abstract: "In our region most classical authors held that the primary aim of cultivating\
    \ soil was to meet crops requirements. In the late 19th century rendering the\
    \ soil\u2019s fertile layer suitable for crop growing was considered to provide\
    \ a good standing place for plants. The word suitable usually applied to the soil\
    \ physical state, its favourably loose structure that was to be developed to the\
    \ required depth. However, it was recognised by some authors back in the late\
    \ 1800s already, that creating soil condition assumed to be required by plants\
    \ may even damage the soil, what with the frequent traffic involved in the process.\
    \ In other words, taking a crop oriented approach will rather do damage than good.\
    \ In a regime of tillage focusing on conservation the need for protecting the\
    \ soil is not subordinated to crops demands. Primarily importance is to create\
    \ a soil condition required by crops takes a lot less energy and causes much less\
    \ mechanical damage in a soil whose good structure and condition has been carefully\
    \ preserved. In the second decade of the new millennium the primary goal of tillage\
    \ is to create and maintain favourable interaction between soil conservation and\
    \ cropping. The aim of soil conservation and environmental protection should realise\
    \ depending on the effectiveness of the EU and national soil conservation endeavours\
    \ and efforts and its duration should be determined by the extent to which such\
    \ practices are adopted across the farming community."
