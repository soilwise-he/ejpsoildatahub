  title: Arduino Based Soil Monitoring System for Suitability of Rice Plantation
  abstract: '<em>In the past few years, technology has grown to the summit. The use
    of computers and electronic devices has been applied in almost every aspect of
    human life. It has thus led to the idea of the soil monitoring system. This paper
    is about soil monitoring system for suitability of rice plantation which would
    use a smartphone and a web application to enable the farmers to get information
    about their field for suitability of rice plantation from a remote location. The
    system has three components: an Arduino microcontroller and other sensors to collect
    site data, an ethernet shield to transfer collected data to the web database,
    a web server to handle the obtained data and a web client and a smartphone to
    get the valuable information from the processed data. The paper focuses on the
    features and design of the proposed system.</em>'
