  title: Computation of total soil organic carbon stock and its standard deviation
    from layered soils
  abstract: To assess carbon sequestration in the agricultural and natural systems,
    it is usually required to report soil organic carbon (SOC) as mass per unit area
    (Mg ha-1) for a single soil layer (e.g., the 0-0.3 m ploughing layer). However,
    if the SOC data are reported as relative concentration (g kg-1 or %), it is required
    to compute the SOC stock and its standard deviation (SD) for a given layer as
    the product of SOC concentration and bulk density (BD). For a proper computation,
    it is required to consider that these two variables are correlated. Moreover,
    if the data are already reported as SOC stock for multiple sub-layers (e.g., 0-0.15
    m, 0.15-0.3 m) it is necessary to compute the SOC stock and its SD for a single
    soil layer (e.g., 0-0.3 m). The correlation between stocks values from adjacent
    and non-adjacent soil sub-layers must be accounted to compute the SD of the single
    soil layer.
