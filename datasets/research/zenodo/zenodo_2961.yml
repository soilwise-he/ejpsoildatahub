  title: Screening of RIL mapping population derived from the rice variety- Rasi,
    for low soil phosphorous tolerance and bacterial leaf blight resistance
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT A rice cultivar, Rasi showed greater tolerance to low soil phosphorous
    (P) when tested under acutely P-deficient plot at ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice
    Research (ICAR-IIRR), Hyderabad. Interestingly, Rasi was also devoid of the popular
    known QTL- Pup1 and is expected to be a novel source for low P tolerance gene(s)/QTLs.
    In the present study, an effort was made to develop breeding lines in the genetic
    background of an elite, bacterial blight (BLB) resistant, fine-grain type rice
    variety- Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) for tolerance to low soil phosphorus (P)
    by using Rasi, as the donor variety. Crosses were carried out and a set of 214
    Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed using single seed decent method.
    The developed RILs were then screened of which, 149 and 131 RILs showed excellent
    tolerance to low soil P and resistance to BLB respectively in Kharif 2019. Two
    RILs (RI-134 and RI-172) were identified and selected which showed tolerance to
    low soil P and BLB possessing medium slender grain type and were high yielding.
    These breeding lines identified can serve as potential donors, which can significantly
    reduce the application of phosphatic fertilizers, reducing cost of cultivation
    and increasing farmers'' profits. Keywords: BLB, Improved Samba Mashuri, Low phosphorous
    tolerance, Rasi, Rice, RIL'
