  title: "Silva Nova \u2013 Restoring soil biology and soil functions to gain multiple\
    \ benefits in new forests"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Afforestation is proposed as one of the most effective climate
    solutions for carbon sequestration. As a majority of threatened species are linked
    to forests, afforestation can also contribute to mitigate the biodiversity crisis.
    There is however a caveat: the agricultural legacy (high nutrient availability,
    altered soil biota structure and function) of new forests constrains the development
    of forest-adapted species, affects tree growth and stability, and delays environmental
    benefits from afforestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that inoculation
    of former arable land with soil (including microbiome, fauna and seeds/rhizomes
    of understory vegetation) from old forests along with targeted tree species mixtures
    will improve productivity and more rapidly restore forest-adapted communities.
    This will ultimately result in diverse, stable and resilient multifunctional forests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
    will test this hypothesis and develop applied inoculation methods by: i) exploring
    soil biota and benchmarking biodiversity in existing afforestation research Chronosequence
    platforms (chronosequences and sites with increasing distance to other forests);
    ii) conducting inoculation experiments in mesocosms to measure seedling performance
    and, above- and belowground linkages; iii) establishing field-scale inoculation
    experiments in new and existing afforestations to test short- and long-term inoculation
    success on forest productivity, biodiversity and soil functioning at the ecosystem
    scale; iv) incorporating the landscape context into guidelines and tools for spatially
    explicit prioritization of areas for assisted dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    aims are to resolve barriers for successful restoration and develop landscape-scale
    afforestation strategies that optimize productivity and biodiversity for the planning
    and implementation of green infrastructure; and produce basic knowledge on the
    tree, understory vegetation, soil fauna and microbiome nexus and its effect on
    forest productivity, biodiversity and soil functions (N-retention, C-sequestration,
    methane uptake).&lt;/p&gt;'
