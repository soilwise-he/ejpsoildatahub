  title: Effect of biochar application on selected soil properties in Southwestern
    Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the effect of biochar on dispersible
    clay and soil chemical properties. The treatments consisted of four rates of milled
    biochar (0, 450, 900 and 1344 kg/ha) arranged in a Completely Randomized Design
    with four replicates. Surface (0-15 cm depth) soil of Iwo (Sandy loam) and Egbeda
    (Loamy sand) soil series were collected from the Teaching and Research Farm, Obafemi
    Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. 1 kg of each soil sample was thoroughly
    mixed with milled biochar at different rate and maintained at field moisture capacity
    for a period of 12 weeks in the screen house. Soil particle size distribution,
    bulk density, dispersible clay, soil pH, soil organic carbon and available phosphorous
    were determined. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance; Duncan&rsquo;s
    New Multiple Range Test was used to separate significant means at p &le; 0.05.
    It was revealed from the results that biochar addition at rate 450 and 1344 kg/ha
    appeared to be more beneficial and adequately improved soil pH, organic carbon
    and available phosphorous. Biochar at 900 kg/ha significantly reduced dispersible
    clay. It was concluded that short term biochar amendment did not improve soil
    quality of loamy sand.&lt;/p&gt;'
