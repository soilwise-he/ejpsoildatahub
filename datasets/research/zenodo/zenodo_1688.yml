  title: AGGREGATION STATUS OF FOUR NIGERIAN SOIL CLASSES TESTED UNDER DIF-FERENT
    WATER SOAKING TIME
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> The effect of soil texture and time of soaking
    on aggregate stability of four major soil textural classes in southeast, Nigeria
    was evaluated. Both the wet and dry sieving techniques were used for the study.
    Result findings indicated mean weight diameter (MWD) of clay loam texture to be
    significantly lowest in wet sieving compared to other texture classes. Period
    of soaking showed non-significant effect with all the indices used. Mean weight
    diameter dry (MWDD) correlated with mean weight diameter wet (MWDW), degree of
    aggregation (DA) and state of aggregation (SA), negatively at time 0, 30, 60,
    90 and 120 minutes respectively. The correlation was significant at P &lt; 0.05
    with MWDW and DA at times 0 minutes. At time 30 minutes, it was significant at
    P &lt; 0.05 with DA, while at time 90 minutes it was significant with MWDW. At
    time 120 minutes MWDD correlated significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with MWDW, DA and
    SA. These results showed that the period of soaking had some contributions to
    the stability of soil aggregates especially with the trend in the correlation
    matrix between MWD dry and MWD wet, DA and SA.
