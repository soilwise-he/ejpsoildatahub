  title: Comparison of ESLRM, MSLM and USLE Soil Loss Models in Imo River Basin in
    Eastern Nigeria
  abstract: '<em>The models Mechanized Soil Loss Model (MSLM) and Empirical Soil Loss
    Regression Model (ESLRM) were compared in line with USLE on average gully erosion
    sites in Imo River Basin in Eastern Nigeria. MSLM was based on the shear stress
    of the soil with equations of gully, rill and interrill erosions were incorporated
    into the model. While ESLRM was a regression analysis with the following parameters:
    rainfall intensity, slope of catchment, duration of rainfall, bulk density of
    soil, catchment area, organic matter and clay content. The models were applied
    in estimating soil loss in the average sub-catchment and compared with soil loss
    estimated from Universal Soil Loss Equation USLE. On the average sub-catchment
    in Imo river basin has the same values on the following parameters; slope S<sub>o</sub>,
    density </em><em>r</em><em>, catchment area A, organic content O and clay content
    C as 3.945%, 19.73kN/m<sup>3</sup>, 1374100m<sup>2</sup>, 24.97% and 11.25% respectively
    while rainfall intensity and duration varies from January to December. The minimum
    value of rainfall intensity is 0.85510836mm/min and Maximum value of 37.5069723mm/min
    for the month of December and September respectively. The duration was also varying
    from January to December depend on the climatic record. The comparison of the
    models was done by plotting MSLM and USLE model against ESLRM and they gave a
    linear soil loss equation with coefficient of determinations R<sup>2</sup> of
    0.863 and 0.911 respectively. Their R<sup>2</sup> percentage error was approximately
    5%. Then plotting the models against months of the year yield a sum total amount
    of soil loss in ton/km<sup>2</sup>/year on ESLRM, MSLM and USLE produced 120.784,
    146.4176 and 129.8045 respectively with their R<sup>2</sup> as 0.935, 0.982 and
    0.986 in their polynomial of six order while the area of the average sub-catchment
    and SCS unit runoff are the same. Considering the R<sup>2</sup> USLE has the perfect
    relation followed by MSLM and ESLRM which has irregular shape of true natural
    occurrence of soil loss and is highly recommended</em><em>.</em>'
