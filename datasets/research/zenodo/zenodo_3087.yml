  title: Effect of Application of Gypsum and Farmyard Manure on Rice (Oryza sativa
    L.) Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Saline sodic soil at Amibara, Ethiopia
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> Abundance of soil with saline sodic property
    in Amibara irrigated farms is becoming a threat to crop productivity. As part
    of the solution to such problem soils, combine application of gypsum and farmyard
    manure has not been investigated well in the area. Therefore study was conducted
    at Worer Agricultural Research Center using rice as a test crop to evaluate Effect
    of GYP and FYM on nitrogen use efficiency of rice. Factorial combinations with
    three rates of FYM (0, 10 and 20 t ha-1) and five rates of gypsum (0%, 25%, 50%,
    75%, 100% GR) were laid out in randomized complete complete block design with
    three replications. Composite surface soil samples before experiment and from
    each treatment after harvest were collected for laboratory analysis. Concerning
    nutrient use efficiency indices agronomic efficiency, agro physiological efficiency
    and apparent recovery efficiency, physiological efficiency and Nitrogen Harvest
    index of nitrogen were significantly(P&lt;0.05) affected by the interaction Effect
    of gypsum and farmyard manure. From the results it could be concluded that the
    combined use of GYP and FYM can ameliorate the adverse impact of ESP and exchangeable
    sodium in saline sodic soil and application of 20 t ha-1 FYM+ 75 % GR enhance
    grain yield and nutrient use efficiency of upland rice grown on saline sodic soil
    of Amibara district. <strong>Key words:</strong> Farmyard manure, Gypsum, Nitrogen,
