  title: A New Era Under Soil Based Probiotics for Anti-Pruritic Combat Among Cats
    with Feline Atopic Skin Syndrome
  abstract: "Present research was conducted at the University of Aydin Adnan Menderes,\
    \ Faculty of Veterinary. In a total of 10 cats with pruritic dermatoses were allocated,\
    \ classified [Feline atopic skin syndrome (FaSs)] and adapted to the retrospective\
    \ case controlled study on the basis of Polycheck in vitro Allergy Test, clinical\
    \ signs, dermatoscopic and cytological examination. No prior drug prescription,\
    \ nor immunosuppressive treatment were evident, which was an inclusion criteria.\
    \ Complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and endocrine panels were all deemed\
    \ available on days 0 and 21 for all cats involved. The Feline Dermatitis Extent\
    \ and Severity Index (FeDESI) and a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) were deemed\
    \ available as relevant prognostic parameters. A three strain invoving soil-based\
    \ probiotic used via rectal route significantly decreased FEDESI and VAS pruritus\
    \ scores after 10 days of rectal use. Pre-treament day 0 FEDESI scores (median\
    \ \xB1 SD) (106.3 \xB1 41.38), were significantly higher than scores on day 10\
    \ (15.3 \xB1 10.53) switching the severity of the disease to mild status in all\
    \ cases. Furthermore, day 0 VAS pruritus scores were 7.4 \xB1 1.78 (mean \xB1\
    \ SD) (prior to treatment), whereas owner VAS pruritus score was decreased to\
    \ 1.3 \xB1 1.06 (mean \xB1 SD) significantly (p=0.005). It should not be unwise\
    \ to draw preliminary conclusion that 3 chained soil-based Bacillus probiotic\
    \ was capable of short term cure for FaSs. Bacillus probiotics with safety usage\
    \ should be added to therapeutical armamentarium of FaSs."
