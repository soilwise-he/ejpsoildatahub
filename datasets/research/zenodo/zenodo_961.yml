  title: Biochemical characterization of antibiotic producing actinomycetes isolated
    from tobacco contaminated soil
  abstract: Isolation of antibiotic producing actinomycetes is useful in identifying
    the compounds responsible for antibacterial<br> activity. The aim of this study
    was to explore the biochemical characterization of antibiotic producing<br> actinomycetes
    and to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the actinomycetes against Staphylococcus
    aureus. In this<br> particular study starch casein agar was used to isolate actinomycetes
    from tobacco contaminated soil in Zimbabwe.<br> Four different colonies were identified
    based on morphology. The different colored colonies observed were pink,<br> white,
    off-white and green. The colonies were further classified under microscope using
    iodine crystal. White<br> colonies showed rod shaped cells with no external features,
    off-white colonies had non-branched sporulating<br> mycelium whereas green colonies
    exhibited sporulating mycelium with vegetative features and pink colonies were<br>
    spherical shaped cells with no external features. All of the four colonies were
    gram positive and were positive for<br> the catalase test. The four different
    colonies were also positive for the lipase test whereas only the white, off-white<br>
    and green colonies were positive for the methyl red test. Zones of inhibition
    were observed in well diffusion assays<br> for antibacterial tests of these actinomycetes
    (green, white, off-white and pink colonies) against S. aureus. Thus,<br> this
    study shows that some actinomycetes have antibacterial activity and may therefore
    be used as sources of<br> antibacterial agents.<br>
