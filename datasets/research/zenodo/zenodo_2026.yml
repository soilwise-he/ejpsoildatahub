  title: Study on Spatial Variability of Soil Properties in an Agrarian Reform Settlement
    in Chapadinha, Brazil
  abstract: "The study of soil chemical and physical properties variability is important\
    \ for suitable management practices. Land use without adequate planning leads\
    \ to soil impoverishment and low crop yield, which results in a decline in the\
    \ socioeconomic and technological level of the rural population. The aim of this\
    \ study was to evaluate the spatial variability of soil properties in the Malhada\
    \ do Meio settlement to subsidize soil use planning. The settlement is located\
    \ in Chapadinha, MA, Brazil, and has an area of 630.86 ha. The vegetation is seasonal\
    \ submontane deciduous forest and steppe savanna. The geology is formed of sandstones\
    \ and siltstones of the <em>Itapecuru</em> Formation and by colluvial and alluvial\
    \ deposits. The relief consists of hills with rounded and flat tops with an average\
    \ altitude of 67 m, and frequently covered over by ferruginous duricrusts. A total\
    \ of 183 georeferenced soil samples were collected at the depth of 0.00-0.20 m\
    \ in <em>Plintossolos</em> , <em>Neossolo</em> and <em>Gleissolo</em>. The following\
    \ chemical variables were analyzed: pH(CaCl<sub>2</sub>), H+Al, Al, SB, V, CEC,\
    \ P, K, OM, Ca, Mg, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;\
    \ along with particle size variables: clay, silt, and sand. Descriptive statistical\
    \ and geostatistical analyses were carried out. The coefficient of variation (CV)\
    \ was high for most of the variables, with the exception of pH with a low CV,\
    \ and of sand with a medium CV. The models fitted to the experimental semivariograms\
    \ of these variables were the exponential and the spherical. The range values\
    \ were from 999 m to 3,690 m. For the variables pH(CaCl<sub>2</sub>), SB, and\
    \ clay, there are three specific areas for land use planning. The central part\
    \ of the area (zone III), where the <em>Plintossolos P\xE9tricos</em> and <em>Neossolos\
    \ Fl\xFAvicos</em> occur, is the most suitable for crops due to higher macronutrient\
    \ content, organic matter and pH. Zones I and II are indicated for environmental\
    \ preservation. This study defined homogeneous areas of the management of high\
    \ and low levels of soil fertility."
