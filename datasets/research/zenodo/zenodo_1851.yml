  title: "Characterising the coincidence of soil moisture \u2013 precipitation extremes\
    \ as a possible precursor to European floods"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Studies around the world have shown that increases in extreme
    precipitation are not directly resulting in reported instances of flooding. Despite
    the evidence that antecedent soil moisture conditions play a significant role
    in regulating the runoff response during extreme storm events, fewer works have
    tried to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such coupled interactions.
    In the present work, we aim to improve our understanding of the dominant spatiotemporal
    patterns of soil moisture (SM) &ndash; precipitation (P) dependence over Europe.
    Using an event-based, non-parametric Event Coincidence Analysis (ECA) approach,
    we first quantified the probability of SM preceding P by the precursor coincidence
    rate. We also examined the statistical precursor relationship between SM-P joint
    episodes and reported annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence
    rate. The results show that seasonality&nbsp;is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal
    dynamics of SM-P coupling over Europe. The conditional precursor coincidence rates
    are in line with previous flood hazard studies over Europe and show the importance
    of considering such diverse interdependencies in flood risk mitigation. Our work
    has implications for understanding the occurrence of preconditioned compound events
    worldwide and provides a vital starting point for characterising the major processes
    that need to be accounted for in comprehensive state of the art flood risk assessment
    studies.&lt;/p&gt;'
