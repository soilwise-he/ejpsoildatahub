  title: Physico-Chemical Parameters Of Organic Manure, Soil And Impact Of Organic
    Manure And Npk Fertilizer On Seed Germination Of Soybean And Wheat
  abstract: <strong><em>In order to investigate the comparative analysis of physico-chemical
    parameters of experimental soil (black cotton soil), vermicompost, farmyard manure
    and their impact on seed germination, the study was conducted by using Randomized
    block design (RBD) with three replications at the Department of Botany Govt. Madhav
    Science P.G. College Ujjain, M.P. The various physico-chemical parameters (pH,
    electric conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc,
    copper, iron, and manganese) and seed germination of soybean and wheat were studied
    in the experiment. The results revealed that pH (7.14), electric conductivity
    (1.84 ds/m), organic carbon (198.53 g/kg), nitrogen (246.57 kg/ha), phosphorus
    (55.24 kg/ha), potassium (438.52 kg/ha), zinc (320.13 ppm), copper (289.34 ppm),
    iron (239.34 ppm) and manganese (248.37 ppm) were found more efficient in vermicompost
    followed by farmyard manure and soil. The results also revealed that seed germination
    percentage of soybean was found highest (91%) by using 20% vermicompost followed
    by 20% farmyard manure (86%), 200 gm NPK (73%) treatment, control (69%) and seed
    germination in wheat was maximum (93%) in 20% vermicompost treatment followed
    by 20% farmyard manure (87%), 200 gm NPK (74%) and minimum (70%) in control. The
    study concluded that vermicompost is nutrient rich and most efficient organic
    manure than farmyard manure and NPK fertilizer for the better growth and sustainable
    agriculture of soybean.</em></strong>
