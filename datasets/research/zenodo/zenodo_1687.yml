  title: Antimicrobial compounds of one Streptomyces celluloflavus strain isolated
    from Can Gio mangrove soil, Vietnam
  abstract: "Marine actinobacteria have emerged as a well-known potential source of\
    \ secondary metabolites which possess useful properties in many fields including\
    \ medical and agricultural applications. The aim of this research was investigated\
    \ the antimicrobial compounds of marine Streptomyces celluloflavus isolated from\
    \ mangrove soil samples taken in Can Gio mangrove soil (Can Gio district), Ho\
    \ Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Herein agar-well diffusion method was employed to measure\
    \ antimicrobial activity of the culturing medium extract against four pathogenic\
    \ bacteria strains. The compound harvested were then analysed by GC-MS method.\
    \ Thirty-one bioactive secondary metabolism compounds were identified in the ethyl-acetate\
    \ \u2013 hexane extract of <em>Streptomyces celluloflavus</em>. The identification\
    \ of these bioactive secondary metabolites compounds is based on the peak area,\
    \ retention time, molecular weight, molecular formula, and antimicrobial actions.\
    \ GC-MS analysis result revealed the presence of the 7 major components including\
    \ 2-pentanone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl, Cycloheptasiloxane, tetradecamethyl, Cyclododecane,\
    \ 1,1,1,3,5,7,7,7-Octamethyl-3,5-bis(trimethylsiloxy)tetrasiloxane, Benzoic acid,\
    \ 2-hydroxy-, 1-methylethyl ester, 1-Hexadecene and Heptasiloxane, hexadecamethyl\
    \ . Therefore, it could be deduced that the remedial potential of mangrove soil\
    \ Streptomyces celluloflavus based on plentiful compounds existing in the extract\
    \ was highly expected."
