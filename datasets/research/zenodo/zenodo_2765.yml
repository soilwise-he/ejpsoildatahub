  title: COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE GROWTH RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION POTENTIAL OF PANICUM
    MAXIMUM AND AXONOPUS COMPRESSUS IN LEAD CONTAMINATED SOIL
  abstract: "The global problem concerning contamination of the environment as a consequence\
    \ of heavy metals is on the increase. Soil contamination by heavy metals is a\
    \ worldwide problem, therefore effective remediation approaches are necessary.\
    \ Some plants can absorb these toxic metals and help to clean them up from the\
    \ soil and sediment. This fact may be useful for developing rational forms of\
    \ environmental safety management and innovative technology which more efficiently\
    \ clean soils and improve their ecological condition with for agriculture. Phytoremediation\
    \ is known as an eco-friendly and cost-effective way of reducing pollutants from\
    \ the soil. Therefore, the present experiment was undertaken to investigate the\
    \ comparative potential of two grasses, <em>Panicum maximum</em> and <em>Axonopus\
    \ compressus</em> to bioremediate lead polluted soils. In addition, the impact\
    \ of Pb on the antioxidant defense system of the plants was studied. Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\
    \ salts were mixed with soil at various concentrations 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg,\
    \ 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg in triplicates and control experiment was also setup.\
    \ After 4 months, the plants were removed and their parts (root, shoot and leaf)\
    \ separated. They were analysed for morphological, biochemical parameters and\
    \ Pb concentration. Soil samples were also analyzed for Pb. The root length of\
    \ both <em>P. maximum</em> and <em>A. compressus</em> generally decreased as the\
    \ concentration of Pb in the soil increased. The least shoot length inhibition\
    \ of <em>A. compressus</em> was 7.13 % (5 mg/kg) while the highest shoot length\
    \ inhibition was 36.29 % (40 mg/kg). The least shoot length inhibition of <em>P.\
    \ maximum</em> was 10.51 % exposed to 5 mg/kg and the highest shoot length inhibition\
    \ was 42.46 % (40 mg/kg). There was more significant reduction of the heavy metals\
    \ in vegetated soils for both <em>P. maximum</em> and <em>A. compressus</em> at\
    \ the end of the study compared to the to the heavy metals in the soils at the\
    \ beginning of the study (p &lt; 0.05). <em>A. compressus</em> is a better removal\
    \ of Pb than <em>P. maximum</em>, however, it was not significant. Glutathione\
    \ (GSH) levels varied significantly (p \u2264 0.05) with respect to concentration\
    \ of heavy metals as well as different part of the plants. <em>A. compressus</em>\
    \ has more effects on the Glutathione activities than <em>P. maximum</em>. Pb\
    \ caused a decrease in the metallothionein level (10.11 %) in <em>P. maximum</em>\
    \ while <em>A. compressus</em> metallothionein level increased by 116.10 % in\
    \ 5 % treatment."
