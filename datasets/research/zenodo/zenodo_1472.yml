  title: Phytoremediation potential of Dilang-aso (Pseudelephantopus spicatus (Juss.)
    Rohr) in lead-contaminated soil
  abstract: 'This study investigated <em>Pseudelephantopus spicatus</em>, a member
    of the family Asteraceae that has not yet been explored in terms of its phytoremediation
    potential. This study utilized two pot experiments: (1) plant tolerance to lead
    (Pb)-contaminated soil, and (2) plant mechanism for Pb uptake. For the plant tolerance
    experiment, plants were exposed to different lead concentrations, and the shoot
    length, width of the largest leaf, and number of leaves were recorded. For the
    Pb uptake experiment, <em>P. spicatus</em> plants were transplanted in polyethylene
    bags containing 1 kg of 500 ppm Pb-treated soil, and were observed every five
    days for 30 days. Results showed that <em>P. spicatus</em> plants in Pb-treated
    soil had significantly shorter shoot length, smaller width of largest leaf, and
    reduced number of leaves, as compared to the control treatment. The Pb uptake
    of <em>P. spicatus</em> also increased with longer exposure time. However higher
    Pb concentration was still observed in the soil (218.57 ppm) compared to the Pb
    concentration in roots (29.49 ppm) and shoot (17.07 ppm). Thus, the <em>P. spicatus</em>
    plant demonstrated tolerance as a Pb excluder, and may not be a good candidate
    for phytoremediation. However, other studies may investigate whether the phytoremediation
    potential of <em>P. spicatus</em> can be improved by observing the effects of
    different Pb concentrations, higher time intervals, or the use of chelating agents
    and fertilizers<br>'
