  title: Effect of Tillage Implement Type and Depth of Ploughing on Field Performance
    Parameters in Vertisol Clay Soil of Gezira Scheme (Sudan)
  abstract: Abstract This study was conducted during 2017 in Gezira scheme which is
    characterized by heavy vertisol clay soil. The objective of the study was to evaluate
    the field performance (effective field capacity "EFC", field efficiency "FE",
    draft, fuel consumption and drawbar power) of three tillage implements (Chisel
    Plough "CP", Moldboard Plough "MP" and Disc Plough "DP"), at three soil depths
    (10, 20 and 30 cm). A split plot design with three replications was used in the
    experiment. The results showed that CP recorded the highest EFC and FE at all
    depths. The highest EFC (1.11 ha/h) for the CP was recorded at 10 cm depth while
    the lowest one (0.42 ha/h) was recorded by the DP at 30 cm depth. The CP also
    recorded the highest FE at all depths (70%, 67% and 65% at 10, 20 and 30 cm; respectively)
    as compared to the other tillage implements. The highest draft values (15.0, 17.5
    and 20.0 kN) were recorded by the MP at 10, 20 and 30 cm depth respectively; as
    compared to that of CP, 9.0, 11.0 and 13.3 and for the DP as7.0, 10.6, and 12.4
    kN, for the same depth in sequence. Due to its high draft, the MP required the
    highest drawbar power, 28.6 kW at 30 cm depth. Low values of fuel consumption
    rate were recorded for the CP as 2.4, 3.4.0 and 4.5 l/ha as compared to 3.8, 4.9
    and 5.9 l/ha; and 4.6, 5.8 and 6.8 l/ha for the DP and MP respectively at the
    three depth in sequence.
