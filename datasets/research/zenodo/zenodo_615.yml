  title: Harnessing AI Technologies for Efficient Soil and Water Management
  abstract: "Sustainable global economic growth is based primarily on agriculture.\
    \ With the continued growth of the human population, pressure on the farming systems\
    \ will intensify, data-intensive methods are used in precision farming and agricultural\
    \ technology. Recent scientific areas that have emerged and are now referred to\
    \ as \"digital agriculture,\" to increase agricultural productivity while reducing\
    \ environmental impacts. Today's agricultural operations generate data from a\
    \ variety of sensors, which helps to improve decision-making by providing a better\
    \ understanding of both the process (data from machinery) and the operating environment\
    \ (the interaction between crop, soil, and weather conditions). In the 20th century,\
    \ advancements in information technology led to the arrival of artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and the subsequent vision of machines driven by AI. A global source of\
    \ current information on crop health, soil conditions, and water availability\
    \ for agricultural production fields is provided by the passive SMO (Social media\
    \ optimization) and other microwave satellite sensors, which register signals\
    \ that radiate from the Earth's surface. This passive microwave technology finds\
    \ solutions for irrigation issues and waterlogging during the dark and through\
    \ clouds. Water damage to crops and other vegetation can be very expensive and\
    \ should be prevented. Soil moisture and AI water data are urgently required for\
    \ hydrological studies and data is vital for improving which will contribute to\
    \ furthering our knowledge of the Earth's water cycle, and will improve climate,\
    \ weather, and extreme-event forecasting. These are current trends in water distribution,\
    \ irrigation management using different Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, wastewater\
    \ recycling, and rainwater harvesting. The information gathered for these uses\
    \ is exclusive and varies in kind. Applying a model or algorithm that can be used\
    \ to provide solutions for all of these applications is therefore desperately\
    \ needed. An intelligent water management system can be designed for sustainable\
    \ water use from natural resources with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ and Deep Learning (DL) techniques combined with an Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ framework.\_"
