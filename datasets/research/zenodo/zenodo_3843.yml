  title: Support Vector Regression For Retrieval Of Soil Moisture Using Bistatic Scatterometer
    Data At X-Band
  abstract: 'An approach was evaluated for the retrieval of soil

    moisture of bare soil surface using bistatic scatterometer data in the

    angular range of 200 to 700 at VV- and HH- polarization. The

    microwave data was acquired by specially designed X-band (10

    GHz) bistatic scatterometer. The linear regression analysis was done

    between scattering coefficients and soil moisture content to select the

    suitable incidence angle for retrieval of soil moisture content. The 250

    incidence angle was found more suitable. The support vector

    regression analysis was used to approximate the function described

    by the input output relationship between the scattering coefficient and

    corresponding measured values of the soil moisture content. The

    performance of support vector regression algorithm was evaluated by

    comparing the observed and the estimated soil moisture content by

    statistical performance indices %Bias, root mean squared error

    (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The values of %Bias,

    root mean squared error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency

    (NSE) were found 2.9451, 1.0986 and 0.9214 respectively at HHpolarization.

    At VV- polarization, the values of %Bias, root mean

    squared error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were

    found 3.6186, 0.9373 and 0.9428 respectively.'
