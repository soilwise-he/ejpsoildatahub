  title: 'The Vital Role of Insects in Soil Health: Guardians of Earth''s Living Cradle'
  abstract: "Soil, often referred to as the \"skin of the Earth,\" is a complex and\
    \ dynamic ecosystem that sustains life in myriad ways. Beneath its surface lies\
    \ a bustling world of microorganisms, plant roots, and, crucially, insects. This\
    \ article delves into the indispensable role of insects in maintaining soil health,\
    \ exploring their diverse functions and the symbiotic relationships that make\
    \ them the unsung heroes of our terrestrial environments. Soil residing insect\
    \ diversity, distribution and richness are determined by several factors such\
    \ which includes organic matter content, soil features, cover vegetation, soil\
    \ disturbance (mechanical soil tillage), fire, and pollution. Moreover, the diverse\
    \ taxa respond in a different way to a variety of prevailing environmental factors.\
    \ Some groups are more sensitive and their population fluctuates with slight changes\
    \ in degree of features available to their surroundings, while others are profuse\
    \ and more able to react to soil degradation. In addition, different species belonging\
    \ to the same taxonomic group can respond differently. As it is known, the Acari\
    \ and Collembola are the two major groups which are generally considered in soil\
    \ quality evaluation approach. Some other groups, such as Coleoptera, Diptera\
    \ and Araneae, are often elaborate in studies aimed to estimate soil health/quality/degradation/pollution,\
    \ while other groups, usually Symphyla, Pauropoda, Pseudoscorpionida and others,\
    \ are normally little discussed in soil quality monitoring or conferred together\
    \ with other soil arthropods taxa.\_"
