  title: Effect Of Integrated Nutrient Management On Some Soil Properties In Mango
    Orchard
  abstract: Mango orchard soils of Uttar Pradesh are generally poor in essential soil
    nutrients and low fertility had impacted productivity as well as fruit quality.
    Integrated nutrient management with different organic and inorganic substrates
    may be a boon to improvement in soil processes and thereby productivity of the
    orchards. Results from an experiment on integrated nutrient management for mango
    orchard indicated improvement in soil properties. Improvement in soil organic
    carbon (SOC) content (0.45%) during four years of experimentation was recorded
    over the initial level of 0.21%. Soil moisture retention improved with organic
    mulching. Microbial activity in the form of dehydrogenase activity was also enhanced
    by integration of organics particularly vermicompost. Positive effect of different
    nutrient sources on availability of NPK and DTPA-extractable micronutrients were
    also revealed. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service
    in June, 2017 before shutting down.
