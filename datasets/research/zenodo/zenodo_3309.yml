  title: Dynamic Soil Structure Interaction In Buildings
  abstract: Since the evolution of computational tools and simulation software, there
    has been considerable increase in research on Soil Structure Interaction (SSI)
    to decrease the computational time and increase accuracy in the results. To aid
    the designer with a proper understanding of the response of structure in different
    soil types, the presented paper compares the deformation, shear stress, acceleration
    and other parameters of multi-storey building for a specific input ground motion
    using Response-spectrum Analysis (RSA) method. The response of all the models
    of different heights have been compared in different soil types. Finite Element
    Simulation software, ANSYS, has been used for all the computational purposes.
    Overall, higher response is observed with SSI, while it increases with decreasing
    stiffness of soil.
