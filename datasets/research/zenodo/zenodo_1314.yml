  title: Estimation and Mapping of Soil Properties Based on Multi-Source Data Fusion
  abstract: 'Recent advances in remote and proximal sensing technologies provide a
    valuable source of information for enriching our geo-datasets, which are necessary
    for soil management and the precision application of farming input resources.
    This is because of the advantages of these modern technologies in that they provide
    a high sampling density enabling the exploration of the within-field spatial and
    temporal variability of soil characteristics, and being fast and cost-effective,
    compared to the traditional laboratory analysis methods. However, soils are complex
    in nature, and measurements of key soil properties or processes in soils might
    not be achievable by the use of a single sensor. This necessitates innovative
    solutions beyond the single-sensor approach, which should be implementable not
    only under laboratory conditions but in situ in either stationary or on-line measurement
    modes. In the past few years, several studies on the implementation of multi-sensor
    (remote and proximal) and data fusion approaches in soil science have been reported
    in the literature, although this research area is still at its early stages of
    development. The aim of such integration is twofold: (1) improves the detection
    accuracy of a soil property or a list of soil properties, and (2) improves the
    quality of soil maps, management zone maps and the resulting decision support
    for variable rate applications in precision agriculture. The integration of different
    data layers has greatly benefited many other applications in agriculture and environmental
    soil modeling that require more extensive temporal and spatial information than
    that contained in any individual dataset provided by a single sensor. At the same
    time, the major progress that has been made in different aspects of digital soil
    mapping (DSM) make DSM more mature and operable than ever before. The integration
    of multi-sensor source data fusion with the DSM technique is foreseen to provide
    a better understanding of soil processes and enable a more accurate estimation
    of soil properties at various spatial and temporal scales. It will also provide
    new insights into processes occurring in soils and sources of variabilities linked
    to soil dynamics in different scenarios of land management practices, precision
    agriculture, environmental pollution, and climate change.'
