  title: Color moment and gray level co-occurrence matrix in classification of soil
    organic matter for patchouli plantation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Patchouli is one of the essential plants that have the most
    potential and widely cultivated in Indonesia. Patchouli is greedily absorbing
    soil nutrients and organic matter. Therefore, the selection of soil with high
    organic matter will maximize the patchouli&rsquo;s productivity. This paper aims
    to facilitate soil&rsquo;s organic matter identification by classifying soil image
    based on the combination of color and texture features. The color feature extraction
    was done using the Color Moments method and the texture feature was done using
    Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. The selection of features was performed
    to obtain the best combination of color and texture features. The selected features
    then was used as input of classification by using Modified K-Nearest Neighbor
    (MKNN). The samples of soil that used as data were taken from several districts
    in Blitar, East Java province. The testing result of this research showed the
    highest accuracy of 93,33% by using 180 training data, and also particular color
    and texture feature combination.&lt;/p&gt;'
