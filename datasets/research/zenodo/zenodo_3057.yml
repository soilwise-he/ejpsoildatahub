  title: 'High-resolution digital mapping of soil organic carbon in permafrost terrain
    using machine learning: a case study in a sub-Arctic peatland environment'
  abstract: "Soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in northern peatlands and\npermafrost-affected\
    \ soils are key components in the global carbon cycle. This\narticle quantifies\
    \ SOC stocks in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland\nenvironment in the discontinuous\
    \ permafrost zone in Abisko, northern Sweden.\nFour machine-learning techniques\
    \ are evaluated for SOC quantification:\nmultiple linear regression, artificial\
    \ neural networks, support vector\nmachine and random forest. The random forest\
    \ model performed best and was\nused to predict SOC for several depth increments\
    \ at a spatial resolution of\n1\u202Fm (1\xD71\u202Fm). A high-resolution (1\u202F\
    m) land cover classification\ngenerated for this study is the most relevant predictive\
    \ variable. The\nlandscape mean SOC storage (0\u2013150\u202Fcm) is estimated\
    \ to be\n8.3\u202F\xB1\u202F8.0\u202Fkg\u202FC\u202Fm&lt;sup&gt;\u22122&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ and the SOC stored in the top meter\n(0\u2013100\u202Fcm) to be 7.7\u202F\xB1\
    \u202F6.2\u202Fkg\u202FC\u202Fm&lt;sup&gt;\u22122&lt;/sup&gt;. The predictive\
    \ modeling\nhighlights the relative importance of wetland areas and in particular\
    \ peat\nplateaus for the landscape's SOC storage. The total SOC was also predicted\
    \ at\nreduced spatial resolutions of 2, 10, 30, 100, 250 and 1000\u202Fm and shows\
    \ a\nsignificant drop in land cover class detail and a tendency to underestimate\n\
    the SOC at resolutions \u2009&gt;\u2009\u202F30\u202Fm. This is associated with\
    \ the occurrence of\nmany small-scale wetlands forming local hot-spots of SOC\
    \ storage that are\nomitted at coarse resolutions. Sharp transitions in SOC storage\
    \ associated\nwith land cover and permafrost distribution are the most challenging\n\
    methodological aspect. However, in this study, at local, regional and\ncircum-Arctic\
    \ scales, the main factor limiting robust SOC mapping efforts is\nthe scarcity\
    \ of soil pedon data from across the entire environmental space.\nFor the Abisko\
    \ region, past SOC and permafrost dynamics indicate that most of\nthe SOC is barely\
    \ 2000\_years old and very dynamic. Future research needs to\ninvestigate the\
    \ geomorphic response of permafrost degradation and the fate of\nSOC across all\
    \ landscape compartments in post-permafrost landscapes."
