  title: HYGIENIC AND ECOLOGICAL SAFETY OF SOIL IN THE CONDITIONS OF UZBEKISTAN
  abstract: "Recently, the problem of environmental protection and public health in\
    \ most countries, including Uzbekistan,has become particularly significant \_\
    due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture, population growth, and\
    \ the increased impact of adverse natural and anthropological factors.One of the\
    \ consequences of these negative factors is pollution of the environment,especially\
    \ the soil, \_\_by harmful chemicals and microorganisms, which have a detrimental\
    \ impact on the\_ population\u2019s health.Therefore , when conducting scientific\
    \ research of an ecological and sanitary-hygienic nature and organizing soil protection,\
    \ it is necessary to use common approaches and methodological techniques developed\
    \ by science and approved by state sanitary supervision bodies."
