  title: 'Biochar as a Versatile and Beneficial Soil Amendment: Recent Approaches'
  abstract: Biochar is a promising and viable fertilizer carrier for microbial fertilizers
    due to its porosity (Wang et al., 2023). Biochar is a type of charcoal produced
    in the slow pyrolysis of organic materials, such as agricultural waste (Aziz et
    al., 2023). Pyrolysis, the method used to create biochar, is the conversion of
    organic materials into a stable form of carbon that can survive in soil for a
    very long time (hundreds to thousands of years). Recently, a co-pyrolysis technique
    for improving sewage sludge biochar's performance and immobilizing heavy metals
    was presented (Fan et al., 2023; He et al., 2023). When organic matter is heated
    in the absence of oxygen, it can break down into its constituent components without
    catching fire, resulting in the development of biochar. In order to create biochar,
    which may be used as a soil amendment to enhance soil health and fertility, a
    variety of organic waste products, including agricultural waste, forestry residue,
    and sewage sludge, are employed in the production process. Contrary to conventional
    charcoal, which is largely used as fuel, biochar is applied to soil as a soil
    supplement to increase soil fertility and production (Khedulkar et al., 2023).
    This enables it to absorb carbon from the air, lowering the concentration of greenhouse
    gases and lessening the effects of climate change.
