  title: Correlation Between The Sowing Date And The Yield Of Maize On Chernozem Soil,
    In Connection With The Leaf Area Index And The Photosynthesis
  abstract: 'Our sowing date experiment took place in the

    Demonstration Garden of Institution of Plant Sciences, Centre for

    Agricultural Sciences of University of Debrecen, in 2012-2014. The

    paper contains data of test year 2014. Our purpose, besides several

    other examinations, was to observe how sowing date influences the

    leaf area index and the activity of photosynthesis of maize hybrids,

    and how those factors affect fruiting. In the experiment we monitored

    the change of the leaf area index and the photosynthesis of hybrids

    with four different growing seasons. The results obtained confirm

    that not only the environmental and agricultural factors in the

    growing season have effect on the yield, but also other factors like

    the leaf area index and the photosynthesis are determinative

    parameters, and all those factors together, modifying the effects of

    each other, develop average yields.'
