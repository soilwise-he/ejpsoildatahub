  title: Developing A Model Based On Image Processing For Soil Slope Stability Assessment
  abstract: Slope stability is one of the most sophisticated and challenging problems
    for all mining and geotechnical engineeringdisciplines. In recent decades, substantial
    progress in the knowledge and practice concerning slope analysis has been made.
    Surface failure is both a natural and artificial phenomenon, with littleinformation
    about the mechanismsbehind suchfailure. The importance of slope stability analysis
    has increased because of a significant increase in the frequency and consequence
    of natural hazards. Therehas been a gradual increase in the power of computers
    and significant progress has been made in the development of specialised software
    based on various methods ofslope stability analysis under dynamic and static conditions.
    Based on the importance of uncertainty in slope stability analysis, an increasing
    role for image processing techniques is ensured. Image processing techniques are
    crucial for both regional and site-specific studies focusing on slope stability
    analysis. The presentstudyemploys one of the most popular image processing techniques,
    partial image velocimetry, to undertake slope stability investigations.
