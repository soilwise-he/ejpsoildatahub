  title: Review on Rooting and Shooting Growth Performance of Populus Alba in Hydroponic
    Soil Cultures
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; In a greenhouse soil
    and hydroponic media experiment was carried out with plastic bottles to examine
    the effects of biochar, azolla, and moss as growth media components on root and
    shooting development performance in tiny cuttings of populous plants. Root installations
    were observed using the cutting length, cutting thickness, and cutting ages. The
    information showed that certain modifications and root media had a major impact
    on the populus establishment. The number of roots, length of roots, number of
    leaves, shoot height, and rooting percentage of the rooted mini-cuttings were
    also measured. Out of all the supplements and rooting media, moss (25 mg L-1)
    outperformed water in the current study in terms of rooting percent (100%), number
    of roots (16.33), and root formation&lt;/p&gt;'
