  title: Laboratory Experiments on Soil Stabilization to Enhance Strength Parameters
    for Road Pavement
  abstract: 'Clay soils can cause significant distress in road construction due to
    their low strength. Stabilizing such soil improve with binder agents prior to
    the geotechnical works can significantly its performance and ensure safety and
    stability of roads while exploitation. This research envisaged the use of five
    different binders (lime, energy fly ash, bio fly ash, slag, cement) as an additive
    stabilizing agents to improve the strength parameters of soil as required in engineering
    industry standards. The variations of strength was assessed using measurements
    of P-wave velocity of the elastic waves propagating through soil specimens stabilized
    by different combination of binders. Measurements were performed on 28 th day
    of soil treatment. The best effects of added binders were noted in the following
    combinations: cement / energy fly ash / bio fly ash (P-waves &gt;3100 m/s), followed
    by combination lime / energy fly ash / GGBFS (P-waves &gt;2800 m/s) and cement
    / lime / energy fly ash (P-waves &gt;2700 m/s). Adding lime is effective due to
    its fixation and chemical bond with particles. The study contributes to the industrial
    tests on soil strength for constructing roadbed.'
