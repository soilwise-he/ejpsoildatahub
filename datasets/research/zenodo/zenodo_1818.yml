  title: 'Accumulation of heavy metals in soil: sources, toxicity, health impacts,
    and remediation by earthworms'
  abstract: "Heavy metals pose serious threats to both individuals and the environment,\
    \ and there is growing global concern over potentially harmful elements. Heavy\
    \ metal contamination can have a significant impact on the soil ecosystem's functioning.\
    \ This requires convenient, efficient, and beneficial remediation approaches.\
    \ The \u201Cecosystem engineer\u201D, earthworms, can modify and enhance soil\
    \ quality. The ability of earthworms to bioaccumulate metals in substantial amounts\
    \ in their tissues makes them potentially beneficial as an ecological indicator\
    \ of soil pollution. Vermiremediation is a new discipline of research in which\
    \ earthworms are used to detoxify organically contaminated soils. Earthworms have\
    \ an influential metabolic system, and their gut bacteria and chloragocyte cells\
    \ play a significant role in their tendency to valorize and detoxify heavy metals.\
    \ Remediation by earthworms can be considered sustainable, efficient, and ecologically\
    \ beneficial. The present review provides a wide range of information on earthworms'\
    \ appropriateness as prospective species for bioremediation and detoxification\
    \ of toxic metal-contaminated soil to mitigate human health and environmental\
    \ problems."
