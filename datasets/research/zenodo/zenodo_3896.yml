  title: The Utilisation Of Two Types Of Fly Ashes Used As Cement Replacement In Soft
    Soil Stabilisation
  abstract: "This study represents the results of an experimental work using two types\
    \ of fly ashes as a cement replacement in soft soil stabilisation. The fly ashes\
    \ (FA1 and FA2) used in this study are by-products resulting from an incineration\
    \ processes between 800 and 1200 \u02DAC. The stabilised soil in this study was\
    \ an intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content.\
    \ The experimental works were initially conducted on soil treated with different\
    \ percentages of FA1 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15%) to identify the optimum FA1 content.\
    \ Then FA1 was chemically activated by FA2 which has high alkalinity by blending\
    \ the optimum content of FA1 with different portions of FA2. The improvement levels\
    \ were evaluated dependent on the results obtained from consistency limits and\
    \ compaction tests along with the results of unconfined compressive strength (UCS)\
    \ tests which were conducted on specimens of soil treated with FA1 and FA2 and\
    \ exposed to different periods of curing (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days). The results\
    \ indicated that the FA1 and FA2 used in this study effectively improved the physical\
    \ and geotechnical properties of the soft soil where the index of plasticity (IP)\
    \ was decreased significantly from 21 to 13.17 with 12% of FA1; however, there\
    \ was a slight increase in IP with the use of FA2. Meanwhile, 12% of FA1 was identified\
    \ as the optimum percentage improving the UCS of stabilised soil significantly.\
    \ Furthermore, FA2 was found effective as a chemical activator to FA1 where the\
    \ UCS was improved significantly after using FA2."
