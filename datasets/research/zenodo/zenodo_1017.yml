  title: Experimental Investigation Of Properties Of Dumped Soil By Adding Steel Slag
  abstract: 'Illegal dumping of construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste is amajor
    source of waste soil and underground water pollution According to European Commission
    (2010), C&amp;Dwaste amounts to about 35% of the total waste generatedEurope-wide.
    C&amp;D waste dumped on bare ground, in forests andin scenic areas, also causes
