  title: Study on soil characteristics and water infiltration rates
  abstract: "Soil infiltration refers to the soil\u2019s ability to allow water movement\
    \ into and through the soil profile. It allows the soil to temporarily store water\
    \ (soil moisture content), making it available for uptake by plants and soil organisms.\
    \ The infiltration rate can be restricted by poor management. Under these conditions,\
    \ the water does not readily enter the soil and it moves down slope as runoff\
    \ or ponds on the surface, where it evaporates. Thus, less water is stored in\
    \ the soil for plant growth, and plant production decreases, resulting in less\
    \ organic matter in the soil and weakened soil structure and soil texture that\
    \ can further decrease the infiltration rate. Runoff can cause soil erosion and\
    \ the formation of gullies. It also carries nutrients and organic matter, which,\
    \ together with sediment, reduce water quality in streams, rivers, and lakes.\
    \ Excessive runoff can cause flooding, erode stream banks, and damage roads. Runoff\
    \ from adjacent slopes can saturate soils in low areas or can create ponded areas,\
    \ thus killing upland plants. The soil and vegetation properties that currently\
    \ limit infiltration and the potential for increasing the infiltration rate must\
    \ be considered in any management plan. This paper investigates the influence\
    \ of water in the soil and its influencing factors to be studied."
