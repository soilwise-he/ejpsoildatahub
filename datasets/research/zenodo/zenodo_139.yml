  title: Soil engineering properties and stabilization of Purulia soil by chemical
    treatment (with calcium salts)
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, Kalyani University, Kalyani-741 235, India<br>\
    \ <em>E-mail</em> : sujitclahiri@ yahoo.com<br> Soil Mechanics Section, River\
    \ Research Institute, W.B., P.O. HRRI, Nadia, India<br> <em>Manuscript received\
    \ 13 September 2004, revised 5 April 2005, accepted 25 April 2005</em> The soil\
    \ index and engineering properties like the specific gravity, grain-size, liquid\
    \ limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), compaction characteristics, compression index\
    \ (Cd, etc. of Purulia soils were studied. The soil characteristics and their\
    \ engineering properties (stabilization) can he considerably improved and strengthened\
    \ through addition of chemicals. A systematic investigation on soil stabilization\
    \ by CaCl<sub>2</sub> and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> to a Purulia soil was carried out.\
    \ The effect of added chemicals on the engineering properties was examined to\
    \ derive useful inferences on stabilization of \xB7the given soils by chemicals.\
    \ Efforts have been made to oiler physico chemical explanation on soil stabilization."
