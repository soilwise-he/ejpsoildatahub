  title: Prediction Of Soil Hydraulic Conductivity From Particle-Size Distribution
  abstract: 'Hydraulic conductivity is one parameter important for predicting the
    movement of water and contaminants dissolved in the water through the soil. The
    hydraulic conductivity is measured on soil samples in the lab and sometimes tests
    carried out in the field. The hydraulic conductivity has been related to soil
    particle diameter by a number of investigators. In this study, 25 set of soil
    samples with sand texture. The results show approximately success in predicting
    hydraulic conductivity from particle diameters data. The following relationship
    obtained from multiple linear regressions on data (R2 = 0.52): Where d10, d50
    and d60, are the soil particle diameter (mm) that 10%, 50% and 60% of all soil
    particles are finer (smaller) by weight and Ks, saturated hydraulic conductivity
    is expressed in m/day. The results of regression analysis showed that d10 play
    a more significant role with respect to Ks, saturated hydraulic conductivity (m/day),
    and has been named as the effective parameter in Ks calculation.'
