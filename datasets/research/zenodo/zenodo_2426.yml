  title: Effects of Soil Amendment on Foliar Disease of Different Cultivars of Groundnut
    (Arachis hypogae) In Owerri, Nigeria
  abstract: <em>Effect of soil amendment on foliar disease of different cultivars
    of groundnut (Arachis hypogae) in Owerri, Nigeria. This experiment was carried
    out at Teaching and Research Farm, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo
    State, Nigeria to identify options in cultivar as well as manure types which farmers
    could adopt in order to control or reduce the effect of foliar diseases of groundnut.
    Four different groundnut cultivars namely Samnut 21, Samnut 22, Samnut 23 and
    one local cultivar from Akure together with different manure types namely Poultry
    manure ten (10) tons/ha, Compost manure ten (10) tons/ha, NPK fertilizer three
    hundred (300) kg/ha and zero manure (Control) were used for the study. Split plot
    design was used in which groundnut cultivars and soil amendment constituted main
    plots and sub plots respectively. Data were collected on disease incidence and
    severity weekly beginning from four to eight weeks after treatment applications.
    Among the four cultivars, Samnut 22 had the least mean value for disease incidence
    of 15.6, 13.8, and 18.0, at 4, 6, and 8 weeks after planting respectively while
    Akure local had the highest mean value for disease incidence and severity of 25.8,
    30.9, 40.1 and 1.0, 1.9, 3.3 at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after planting respectively.
    The application of Poultry manure had the least mean value of disease incidence
    and severity of 8.0, 9.2, 11.9 and 0.4, 1.4, 0.8 at 4, 6, and 8 weeks after planting
    respectively. Zero soil amendment (Control) had the highest mean value for disease
    incidence and severity of 31.9, 36.1, 46.9 and 1.8, 2.7, 3.4 at 4, 6, and 8 weeks
    after planting respectively. Application of poultry manure best suppressed leaf
    spot disease of groundnut. Samnut 22 consistently showed the least mean value
    for disease incidence and ranked second in mean for disease severity. This makes
    it most preferred to other cultivars in disease incidence as well as disease severity.
    Planting of Samnut 22 together with application of poultry manure reduced foliar
    disease of groundnut significantly.</em>
