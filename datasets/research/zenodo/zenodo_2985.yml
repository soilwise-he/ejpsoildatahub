  title: Isolation of Bacillus thuringiensis strains from Saudi Arabia soil and study
    of their potential efficiency against the lepidopteran pest Ephestia kuehniella
  abstract: Insect pests represent a major threat to food crops and human health,
    and therefore have to be combated in several ways, including chemical methods.
    However, researchers demonstrated that these molecules are dangerous for the farmers,
    consumers and the environment in general. For this reason, scientists permanently
    searched environment friendly alternatives such as the use of the bacterium <em>Bacillus
    thuringiensis</em> classified as one of the best insect pathogens. This microorganism
    is known by its ability to produce two types of insecticidal proteins, Vegetative
    insecticidal proteins (Vip) and delta-endotoxins produced during vegetative and
    sporulation stages of growth, respectively. In the present study, 15 <em>B. thuringiensis</em>
    strains were isolated from soil collected from different regions in Saudi Arabia
    (Al Baha, Jeddah, Khulis and Yanbu). <em>B. thuringiensis</em> isolates were then
    classified according to the shape of their parasporal crystals identified under
    microscope and proteins content of these crystals. Delta-endotoxins efficiency
    of the different isolates was investigated and promising strains were identified
    as very active. After 5 days-treatment, <em>B. thuringiensis </em>isolates 14
    and 7 killed <em>Ephestia kuehniella</em> larvae with low LC<sub>50</sub> of about
    59.18 and 65.67 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The results described in the
    present study proved that the new <em>B. thuringiensis</em> isolates could be
    of a great interest in the control of lepidopteran pests by using their delta-endotoxins
    in bioinsecticide formulations.
