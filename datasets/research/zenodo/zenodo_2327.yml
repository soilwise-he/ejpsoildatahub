  title: The Effect Of Soil Moisture Content On The Energy Requirement And Fuel Consumption
    Of The Machinery Unit
  abstract: "The field experiment was conducted in one of college of agricultural\
    \ fields \u2013 university of Baghdad \u2013 Abu ghraib for 2016 in a silty clay\
    \ loam soil study power and fuel consumption requirement s , two types of tractors\
    \ and three types of plows were used as a machinery unit , this study design by\
    \ a spilt plot under randomize complete block design with three replicates and\
    \ tasted by the average less significant  different with level of probability\
    \ ( 0.05 ) , the main factor was use two level of soil moisture content ( 18 \u2013\
    \ 20 % ) and ( 14 \u2013 16 % ) , the secondary factor was use three type of plow\
    \ ( moldboard , chisel and sweep ) , The research includes the study of fuel consumption\
    \ ( L/hr ) , specific fuel consumption ( L/hr.hp ) , drawbar pull ( kn ) and specific\
    \ energy ( hp/m<sup>3</sup> ) .\n\n \n\nThe results showed that the soil moisture\
    \ content ( 14 \u2013 16 % ) having less fuel consumption ( 8.36 L/hr ) and less\
    \ specific fuel consumption ( 0.221 L/hr.hp ) and less drawbar pull ( 8.99 kn\
    \ ) and less specific energy ( 1.027 hp/m<sup>3</sup> ) , the sweep plow having\
    \ a less fuel consumption ( 8.75 L/hr ) and less specific fuel consumption ( 0.233\
    \ L/hr.hp ) and less drawbar pull ( 9.07 kn ) and less specific energy ( 0.887\
    \ hp/m<sup>3</sup> ) , the interaction between the soil moisture content ( 14\
    \ \u2013 16 % ) and sweep plow having a less fuel consumption ( 7.11 L/hr ) and\
    \ less specific fuel consumption ( 0.186 L/hr.hp ) and less drawbar pull ( 7.9\
    \ kn ) and less specific energy ( 0.844 hp/m<sup>3</sup> ) ."
