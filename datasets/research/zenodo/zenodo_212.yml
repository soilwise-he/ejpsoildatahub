  title: New Developments In Proximal Soil Sensing
  abstract: This presentation provides an overview of contemporary developments in
    the field of proximal soil sensing (PSS) as it relates to precision agriculture.
    The ultimate goal of PSS is to enable low-cost acquisition of accurate information
    on spatial and temporal changes in soil properties across a landscape. Proximal
    sensing systems rely on gathering signals from transducers placed in contact,
    or less than 2 m away, from the target. Knowing and understanding the heterogeneity
    of soil properties helps farmers and other land managers optimize their decision-making
    process to develop profitable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly operations.
    The emphasis will be placed on recent efforts in sensor fusion, when sensors that
    measure different physical phenomena are integrated in a single platform and/or
    data acquisition process. The recent development of the on-the-spot soil analyser
    will be used as an example. Under this framework, several sensing methods will
    be discussed in more detail. These include digital microscopy, soil gas analysis,
    visible, near-infrared, mid-infrared, gamma-ray as well as laser-induced breakdown
    spectroscopy, capacitance and apparent electrical conductivity, and ion-selective
    membranes. Despite their various limitations, these sensing techniques, together
    with field topography mapping, have been successfully deployed to rapidly determine
    an array of important physical, chemical and biological soil properties. The recently
    developed neighbourhood search analysis software has been used to numerically
    integrate multiple geospatial data layers and produce field areas representing
    different sensor measurement combinations as well as locating the most informative
    calibration sites. The presentation will review several alternative approaches
    to process PSS data to generate thematic soil maps suitable for site-specific
    management of seed, lime, fertilizer and other soil amendments.
