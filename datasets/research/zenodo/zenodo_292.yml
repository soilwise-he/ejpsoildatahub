  title: Collecting gas samples for greenhouse gas analysis and soil and lysimeter
    samples for nitrogen availability in soil
  abstract: This SOP provides practical instructions for installing equipment to sample
    greenhouse gases, soil and soil pore-space water in field experiment for combinable
    crops. Data from sample analyses, in combination with agronomic data, provides
    an assessment of nitrogen and carbon flows within crops at fixed time points and
    could be used to, for instance, examine the effects of conventional farming methods
    <em>vs.</em> sustainable farming methods. This methodology uses standard gas collection
    chambers, lysimeters and sampling methods, that could allow other institutes to
    develop gas sampling capability and produce results that are comparable with data
    collected in other projects using this method.
