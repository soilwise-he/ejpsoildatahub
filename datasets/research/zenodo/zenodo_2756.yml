  title: Effect of Land-Use Management Systems on Coupled Hydraulic Mechanical Soil
    Processes Defining the Climate-Food-Energy-Water Nexus
  abstract: "Soils are the most critical life-supporting compartments of the biosphere.\
    \ They provide<br>\nnumerous ecosystem services such as habitat for biodiversity,\
    \ water and nutrients, as well as<br>\nproducing food, feed, fiber and energy.\
    \ Soils undergo intense and irreversible changes due to<br>\na non-site adjusted\
    \ land management and improper application of machinery and techniques<br>\nin\
    \ its broadest sense. In combination with the growing population (until 2050 we\
    \ will have<br>\napprox. 9 Billion people) the urgent need for a more reliable\
    \ dataset of soil properties and soil<br>\nfunctions gains in importance in order\
    \ to even prepare more reliable models for various<br>\nrequests. The mechanical\
    \ strength \u2013 the precompression stress - as the result of geo-, pedoand<br>\n\
    anthropogenic long-term processes - can be defined as the basis for quantifying\
    \ the<br>\nrigidity boundary. It distinguishes between the recompression stress\
    \ (i.e. elastic, rigid<br>\nproperties) and the virgin compression stress range\
    \ where plastic deformation including<br>\nirreversible changes of properties\
    \ and functions occur. The changes in the hydraulic or<br>\npneumatic functions\
    \ like hydraulic or air conductivity, the pore size distribution primarily all<br>\n\
    occur in the virgin compression stress range, The same is also true for redox\
    \ reactions and the<br>\nbiological activity (respiration) in soils but also carbon\
    \ sequestration potential is also linked<br>\nwith the precompression stress value.\
    \ Thus, a more precise definition and following of sitespecific<br>\nfunctionality\
    \ differences, which may exclude or concentrate certain land use or<br>\nmanagement\
    \ forms are needed, in order to optimize yield, soil protection and a sustainable<br>\n\
    land use management considering the limited site specific resilience at the same\
    \ moment."
