  title: Slope aspect and altitude effect on selected soil organic matter characteristics
    in Beskid Mountains forest soils
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;In the era of dynamic climate change, it is important to have\
    \ knowledge on the interactions between climatic factors and processes occurring\
    \ in the soil environment. The present study aimed to determine how slope aspect\
    \ and altitude above sea level influence&nbsp;carbon and nitrogen accumulation\
    \ and dehydrogenases activity of forest soils. The study was conducted in the\
    \ Beskid \u017Bywiecki in the south-facing part of Poland. Soils of the same texture,\
    \ with similar vegetation species composition, in different altitude variants\
    \ (600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m above sea level) and different north-facing and south-facing\
    \ slope aspect were selected for the study. For each height and slope aspect variant,\
    \ samples were collected from the surface horizons of soils for further analyses.\
    \ The basic chemical properties and dehydrogenases activity of the soil samples\
    \ were determined. Carbon and nitrogen stocks in the surface horizons of the soils\
    \ were calculated. The analyses confirmed the influence of location conditions\
    \ on the carbon and nitrogen stocks in mountain forest soils. The stock of carbon\
    \ and nitrogen increased with the height up to 1000 m a.s.l. In the&lt;br&gt;\n\
    soils at the highest altitude, the reserve of carbon and nitrogen decreased regardless\
    \ of the slope aspect variant. There were no statistically significant differences\
    \ in carbon and nitrogen stocks between slope aspect variant. The highest dehydrogenases\
    \ activity was associated with the organic horizons of the soils at the lowest\
    \ altitude in height gradient. In our study, higher dehydrogenases activity was\
    \ observed in the north-facing slope soils, and this finding can be explained\
    \ by more stable thermal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;"
