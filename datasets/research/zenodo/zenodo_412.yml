  title: Mapping Soil Properties with Fixed Rank Kriging of Proximally Sensed Soil
    Data Fused with Sentinel-2 Biophysical Parameter
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil surveys with line-scanning platforms appear to have great
    advantages over the&lt;br&gt;

    traditional methods used to collect soil information for the development of field-scale
    soil mapping&lt;br&gt;

    and applications. These carry VNIR (visible and near infrared) spectrometers and
    have been used&lt;br&gt;

    in recent years extensively for the assessment of soil fertility at the field
    scale, and the delineation&lt;br&gt;

    of site-specific management zones (MZ). A challenging feature of VNIR applications
    in precision&lt;br&gt;

    agriculture (PA) is the massiveness of the derived datasets that contain point
    predictions of soil&lt;br&gt;

    properties, and the interpolation techniques involved in incorporating these data
    into site-specific&lt;br&gt;

    management plans. In this study, fixed-rank kriging (FRK) geostatistical interpolation,
    which is a&lt;br&gt;

    flexible, non-stationary spatial interpolation method especially suited to handling
    huge datasets,&lt;br&gt;

    was applied to massive VNIR soil scanner data for the production of useful, smooth
    interpolated&lt;br&gt;

    maps, appropriate for the delineation of site-specific MZ maps. Moreover, auxiliary
    Sentinel-2 databased&lt;br&gt;

    biophysical parameters NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and fAPAR
    (fraction of&lt;br&gt;

    photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy) were included as covariates
    to improve&lt;br&gt;

    the filtering performance of the interpolator and the ability to generate uniform
    patterns of spatial&lt;br&gt;

    variation from which it is easier to receive a meaningful interpretation in PA
    applications. Results&lt;br&gt;

    from the VNIR prediction dataset obtained from a pivot-irrigated field in Albacete,
    southeastern&lt;br&gt;

    Spain, during 2019, have shown that FRK variants outperform ordinary kriging in
    terms of filtering&lt;br&gt;

    capacity, by doubling the noise removal metrics while keeping the computation
    cost reasonably low.&lt;br&gt;

    Such features, along with the capacity to handle a large volume of spatial information,
    nominate the&lt;br&gt;

    method as ideal for PA applications with massive proximal and remote sensing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;'
