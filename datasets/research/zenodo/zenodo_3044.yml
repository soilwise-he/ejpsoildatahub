  title: Spatial segregation of the biological soil crust microbiome around its foundational
    cyanobacterium, Microcoleus vaginatus, and the formation of a nitrogen-fixing
    cyanosphere
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Biological soil crusts\
    \ (biocrusts) are a key component of arid land ecosystems, where they render critical\
    \ services such as soil surface stabilization and nutrient fertilization. The\
    \ bundle-forming, filamentous, non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Microcoleus\
    \ vaginatus&lt;/i&gt; is a pioneer primary producer, often the dominant member\
    \ of the biocrust microbiome, and the main source of leaked organic carbon. We\
    \ hypothesized that, by analogy to the rhizosphere of plant roots, &lt;i&gt;M.\
    \ vaginatus&lt;/i&gt; may shape the microbial populations of heterotrophs around\
    \ it, forming a specialized cyanosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:\
    \ &lt;/strong&gt;By physically isolating bundles of &lt;i&gt;M. vaginatus&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ from biocrusts, we were able to study the composition of the microbial populations\
    \ attached to it, in comparison to the bulk soil crust microbiome by means of\
    \ high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. We did this in two &lt;i&gt;M. vaginatus&lt;/i&gt;-dominated\
    \ biocrust from distinct desert biomes. We found that a small, selected subset\
    \ of OTUs was significantly enriched in close proximity to &lt;i&gt;M. vaginatus&lt;/i&gt;.\
    \ Furthermore, we also found that a majority of bacteria (corresponding to some\
    \ two thirds of the reads) were significantly more abundant away from this cyanobacterium.\
    \ Phylogenetic placements suggest that all typical members of the cyanosphere\
    \ were copiotrophs and that many were diazotrophs (Additional\_file\_1: Tables\
    \ S2 and S3). Nitrogen fixation genes were in fact orders of magnitude more abundant\
    \ in this cyanosphere than in the bulk biocrust soil as assessed by qPCR. By contrary,\
    \ competition for light, CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; and low organic carbon concentrations\
    \ defined at least a part of the OTUs segregating from the cyanobacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:\
    \ &lt;/strong&gt;We showed that &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaginatus&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ acts as a significant spatial organizer of the biocrust microbiome. On the one\
    \ hand, it possesses a compositionally differentiated cyanosphere that concentrates\
    \ the nitrogen-fixing function. We propose that a mutualism based on C for N exchange\
    \ between &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaginatus&lt;/i&gt; and copiotrophic\
    \ diazotrophs helps sustains this cyanosphere and that this consortium constitutes\
    \ the true pioneer community enabling the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils.\
    \ On the other hand, a large number of biocrust community members segregate away\
    \ from the vicinity of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaginatus&lt;/i&gt;, potentially\
    \ through competition for light or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or because of a\
    \ preference for oligotrophy.&lt;/p&gt;"
