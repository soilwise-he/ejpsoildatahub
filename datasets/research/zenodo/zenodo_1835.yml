  title: Georeferenced tractor wheel slip data for prediction of spatial variability
    in soil physical properties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The upcoming technological breakthrough in the cropping system
    will offer a more detailed insight into soil-to-plant, man-to-soil, and man-to-plant
    impacts, thus improving the forecasting and ensuring more efficient in-field management.
    This study presents various on-the-go sensing procedures which were conducted
    in order to evaluate the quality of spatial estimations of soil physical properties
    such as soil compaction, soil moisture content, bulk density and texture. Standard
    statistical tools showed high positive correlations between soil specific resistance
    and soil compaction (R2 = .75), soil electromagnetic conductivity and moisture
    content (R2 = .72) and tractor wheel slip and soil compaction (R2 = .64). Variogram
    modeling of spatial autocorrelation gave the highest prediction error for tillage
    resistance (9.85%), followed by cone index (4.49%), moisture content (3.7%), bulk
    density (1.39%), clay + silt content (.98%), soil electromagnetic conductivity
    (.95%) and the least error was obtained for tractor wheel slip (.58%). The Central
    Composite Design (CCD) analysis confirmed significant contribution of soil compaction
    in the modeling of the specific soil resistance and tractor wheel slip, while
    soil moisture content and fine particle (clay + silt) content had a major impact
    on soil electromagnetic conductivity measurement. Soil bulk density had considerable
    importance in CCD modeling of tractor wheel slip.&lt;/p&gt;'
