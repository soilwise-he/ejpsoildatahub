  title: Effects of Soil Profile on the Transient Performance of Substation Grounding
    System
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Lightning transient characteristic of the grounding grid is
    fundamental for optimum performance of lightning protection of a substation. In
    order to design an appropriate grounding system for such substation, it is important
    to study its transient characteristics because the high impulse current is significantly
    different compared to power frequency current. In this paper, substation grounding
    grid model was developed using CDEGS software to analyze the grid transient performance
    in terms of ground potential rise (GPR), touch voltage and step voltage when the
    grounding system is struck by a lightning impulse current. Several parameters,
    such as lightning current amplitude, feed point and the number of sub-grid, were
    altered to study their relationship with the transient performance. The maximum
    transient GPR, touch voltage, and step voltage increase as the lightning current
    amplitude increase. The maximum transient GPR and step voltage are the highest
    at the corner of the grounding grid while the maximum touch voltage is the highest
    at the centre of the grounding grid. In addition, the maximum transient GPR and
    step voltage decrease when the number of sub-grid increases. In contrast, the
    touch voltage slightly increases as the number of sub-grid increases. The maximum
    transient GPR, and step voltage are the highest at the 2-layer and the lowest
    at the uniform soil or single-layer soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
