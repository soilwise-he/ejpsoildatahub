  title: Variability of soil enzyme activities and vegetation succession following
    boreal forest surface soil transfer to an artificial hill
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;A landfill site in southern Finland was converted into urban\
    \ green space by covering it with a layer of fresh forest humus transferred from\
    \ nearby construction sites. The aim was to develop the 70 m high artificial hill\
    \ into a recreational area with high biodiversity of flora and fauna. Forest humus\
    \ was used as a source of organic matter, plant roots, seeds, soil fauna and microorganisms\
    \ in order to enable rapid regeneration of diverse vegetation and soil biological\
    \ functions. In this study we report the results of three years of monitoring\
    \ of soil enzyme activity and plant species compositional patterns. Monthly soil\
    \ samples were taken each year between June and September from four sites on the\
    \ hill and from two standing reference forests using three replicate plots. Activities\
    \ of 10 different enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM) content, moisture, pH and\
    \ temperature of the surface layer were monitored. Abundances of vascular plant\
    \ species were surveyed on the same four hill sites between late May and early\
    \ September, three times a season in 2004 and 2005. Although the addition of organic\
    \ soil considerably increased soil enzyme activities (per dw), the activities\
    \ at the covered hill sites were far lower than in the reference forests. Temporal\
    \ changes and differences between sites were analysed in more detail per soil\
    \ organic matter (SOM) in order to reveal differences in the quality of SOM. All\
    \ the sites had a characteristic enzyme activity pattern and two hill sites showed\
    \ clear temporal changes. The enzyme activities in uncovered topsoil increased,\
    \ whereas the activities at the covered Middle site decreased, when compared with\
    \ other sites at the same time. The different trend between Middle and North sites\
    \ in enzyme activities may reflect differences in humus material transferred to\
    \ these sites, but difference in the succession of vegetation affects enzyme activities\
    \ strongly. Middle yielded higher \u03B2-sitosterol content in 2004, as an indication\
    \ of more intense plant impact. All reclaimed sites had characteristic plant species\
    \ assemblages and parallel temporal changes, reflecting vegetation succession,\
    \ occurred across all the sites. Rapid growth of vegetation on the covered sites\
    \ restored the rhizosphere and contributed to the persistence of microbial activity.\
    \ We suggest that transferring the surface soil humus layer is a useful approach\
    \ for ensuring the outcome of habitat restoration and complementary habitat creation\
    \ especially in situations where the source soil areas would otherwise be lost.&lt;/p&gt;"
