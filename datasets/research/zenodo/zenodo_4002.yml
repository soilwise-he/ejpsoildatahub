  title: Analysis of heavy metals (Pb and Cd) in soil, peach fruit and its accumulation
    in human blood
  abstract: "<strong>\u201C\u201D</strong> IJAAR welcome all of you to submit your\
    \ research paper for publication in the field of <strong><em>Agriculture, Agronomy,\
    \ Horticulture</em></strong> etc. Please submit your manuscripts via <strong><em>Online\

    Heavy metals are among the most hazardous substance present in the environment.\
    \ Their presence in soil results in contamination of plants and consequently the\
    \ food we obtain form plants. Consumption of contaminated food (fruits and vegetables)\
    \ is the major cause of toxic metals transfer into human body. Cadmium (Cd) and\
    \ lead (Pb) are among the most toxic heavy metals and cause serious health problem\
    \ in humans. The current study was conducted to evaluate the concentration of\
    \ cadmium in soil, peach fruit and human blood. Soil was collected from peach\
    \ gardens and blood samples were taken from individuals. Blood samples were taken\
    \ at two stages; before and after consumption of peaches. The obtained result\
    \ showed that concentration of Cd in soil exceed the World Health Organization\
    \ (WHO) standard limit while Pb concentration in soil was recorded within safe\
    \ limit. Concentration of Pb and Cd in peach fruit exceed the safe limit while\
    \ its seed contain lower concentration of the metals. The concentration of Cd\
    \ and Pb in blood sample before treatment were (1.86 ppm) and (5.95 ppm) respectively.\
    \ While the concentration of Cd and Pb in blood sample after treatment was (1.88\
    \ ppm) and (6.00 ppm) respectively. After treatment of peach, increase in the\
    \ concentration of Cd and Pb was found in blood sample. Further investigation\
    \ is suggested to find the effect of toxic metals like Cd and Pb on human physiology\
    \ and biochemistry.\n\n<strong><em>International Journal of Agronomy and Agricultural\
