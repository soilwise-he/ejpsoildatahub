  title: THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF BLACK SOLDIER FLYMAGGOT MEDIUM ENRICHED DOMESTIC
    FOOD WASTE FOR ORGANIC SOIL
  abstract: Green economy is a concern in the world of agriculture through environmentally
    sound cultivation techniques. One of the biggest environmental issues in the living
    economy is wasted food waste. A reliable organic decomposer is the maggot black
    soldier fly. This study aims to provide answers related to the media potential
    of BSF maggots enriched with home food waste in terms of nutrition. A total of
    3 groups of BSF maggot media formulas consisting of A (75:25) group, B (50:50)
    group and C (25:75 group). The mixture in the media includes wheat bran and food
    waste The media is then given a fly attractant so that BSF will lay eggs there.
    The media is waited for 2 months and then observed again after 1 month of cultivation
    and the media is taken to measure nutrient levels including protein, carbohydrate,
    lipid, water and ash levels through proximate tests. The data was statistically
    analysed One Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test with p<0.05. The results showed
    that BSF maggots were easier to grow in formula B (50:50) than the other 2 groups.
    The nutritional value of the media with formula B (50:50) was significantly better
    than the other 2 groups. This study concluded that the 50:50 formula between wheat
    bran and food waste is the best formula for maggot growth with high media nutrients.
    This media can be used as organic soil to support agriculture in the green economy
    era.
