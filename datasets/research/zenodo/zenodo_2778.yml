  title: 'An innovative procedure for monitoring the change in soil seismic response
    by InSAR data: application to the Mexico City subsidence'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;We developed an empirical procedure to evaluate the effect of\
    \ the ground subsidence on the spatial and temporal seismic response of soils.\
    \ The proposed method exploits the capabilities of the spaceborne SAR Interferometry\
    \ technique to detect and map the ground subsidence with unprecedented spatial\
    \ and tem- poral coverage. The information provided by satellites is combined\
    \ with a-priori geological/geotechnical information to assess the soil compaction\
    \ and the shortening of the soil vibration periods. The procedure was applied\
    \ to estimate the shortening of the soil resonant period of Mexico City between\
    \ 2005 and 2013. The results show that in approximately nine years the ground\
    \ surface has subsided by approxi- mately 0.5\u20133.5 m and the soil resonant\
    \ period has decreased by approximately 0.1\u20130.4 s. The obtained results,\
    \ validated with field measurements, highlight the effectiveness of the proposed\
    \ procedure for the continuous monitoring of the soil resonant periods. The estimated\
    \ change in resonant period on Mexico City has a great impact on the response\
    \ spectra used for design, it is then necessary to update the map of the soil\
    \ resonant period in order to account for the change of dynamic properties of\
    \ soils caused by subsidence.&lt;/p&gt;"
