  title: Stabilization Of Sub Grade Soil By Using Foundry Sand Waste
  abstract: "Due to various construction development projects undertaken all over\
    \ the world there is a substantial increase in the production of waste materials\
    \ like concrete, fly ash, plastic, rice husk, foundry sand etc. which create disposal\
    \ problems. Foundry waste sand is produced in large quantity in foundry industries\
    \ and is disposed in open land. Therefore use of foundry waste sand in foundation\
    \ of buildings and in road constructions to improve bearing capacity of soil and\
    \ to reduce the area of open land needed for its disposal and to preserve environment\
    \ through resource conservation.Soil is a base of a structure which supports the\
    \ structure from beneath and distributes the load effectively. The present study\
    \ deals with  stabilization of soil by using foundry waste sand in different proportion\
    \ in original soil. In this study laboratory tests such as Atterberg\u2019s Limit\
    \ Test, Direct Shear Test and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) Test were carried\
    \ out for both modified and unmodified soil. The results show that Maximum Dry\
    \ Density and CBR values were improved after addition of foundry waste sand to\
    \ the soil"
