  title: Comparative Study On Soil Tillage Using Rotary Tiller And Power Harrow
  abstract: Farmers try to reduce steps of soil preparation by using subsoiler and
    then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and
    a power harrow which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore,
    this study was conducted to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller
    and a power harrow applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the
    rotary tiller and the power harrow had negative slip, indicating that they generated
    force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to
    lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the power harrow.
    Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for
    two equipment types were significantly different. However, no significant differences
    were found for the forward speeds, slips, drawbar pulls and drawbar powers. Comparative
    analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power
    to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar
    power to working area and soil pulverization.
