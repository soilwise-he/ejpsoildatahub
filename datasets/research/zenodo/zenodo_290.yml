  title: EFFECT OF BIOCHAR ON SOIL N, P, K CONTENT, PH, ENZYME ACTIVITY AND SOIL WATER
    HOLDING CAPACITY
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> In this study, the effect of biochar samples
    prepared on the basis of chicken manure and household waste on the amount of macro-elements,
    pH values, the activity of enzymes, and total moisture holding capacity of soybean-planted
    soils were studied. It was determined that biochar samples have a positive effect
    on the general condition of the soil.
