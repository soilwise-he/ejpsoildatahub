  title: Sliding Joints And Soil-Structure Interaction
  abstract: 'Use of a sliding joint is an effective method to

    decrease the stress in foundation structure where there is a horizontal

    deformation of subsoil (areas afflicted with underground mining) or

    horizontal deformation of a foundation structure (pre-stressed

    foundations, creep, shrinkage, temperature deformation). A

    convenient material for a sliding joint is a bitumen asphalt belt.

    Experiments for different types of bitumen belts were undertaken at

    the Faculty of Civil Engineering - VSB Technical University of

    Ostrava in 2008. This year an extension of the 2008 experiments is in

    progress and the shear resistance of a slide joint is being tested as a

    function of temperature in a temperature controlled room. In this

    paper experimental results of temperature dependant shear resistance

    are presented. The result of the experiments should be the sliding

    joint shear resistance as a function of deformation velocity and

    temperature. This relationship is used for numerical analysis of

    stress/strain relation between foundation structure and subsoil. Using

    a rheological slide joint could lead to a decrease of the reinforcement

    amount, and contribute to higher reliability of foundation structure

    and thus enable design of more durable and sustainable building

    structures.'
