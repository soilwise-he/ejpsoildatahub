  title: Studies on the Possibility of Using Zinc-EDTA Chelate as a Combined Micronutrient
    Fertilizer and Soil Iron Mobilizer
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture,\
    \ Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, West Bengal. <em>Manuscript received\
    \ 12 August 1974 ; revised 30 December 1975 ; accepted 30 March 1976.</em> Two\
    \ alluvial soils of West Bengal were incubated for different lengths of time separately\
    \ with starch, EDTA and Zn-EDTA, the equilibrium \\(p\\)H values were measured\
    \ and relative quantities of iron going into the solution phase were determined.\
    \ Amongst the above reagents only EDTA (di sodium salt) has been found to depress\
    \ the soil \\(p\\)H to a marked extent. In case of starch or Zn\xADEDTA, a trend\
    \ towards increasing the \\(p\\)H was noticed; especially, in the soil characterized\
    \ by a wider C:N ratio (Harm-soil). The initial rate of mobilization of iron was\
    \ very high when EDTA was used but the micronutrient element was released at a\
    \ more or less constant rate through\xADout the incubation period when Zn-EDTA\
    \ was employed. Starch is apparently more effective than Zn-EDTA as a soil iron\
    \ mobilizer in Harin-soil. In the other soil (Rana-soil), however, the following\
    \ general order of efficiency was observed: EDTA&gt; Zn-EDTA&gt; starch. It has\
    \ been sugges\xADted that Zn-EDTA chelate may be used quite effectively as a combined\
    \ zinc fertilizer and soil iron mobilizer."
