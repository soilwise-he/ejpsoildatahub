  title: Hazards Assessment Of Radon Exhalation Rate And Radium Content In The Soil
    Samples In Iraqi Kurdistan Using Passive And Active Detecting Methods
  abstract: 'This study aims to assess the environmental hazards

    from radon exhalation rate in the soil samples in selected locations in

    Iraqi Kurdistan, using passive (CR-39NTDs) and active (RAD7)

    detecting method. Radon concentration, effective radium content and

    radon exhalation rate were estimated in soil samples that collected at

    the depth level of 30 cm inside 124 houses. The results show that the

    emanation rate for radon gas was variation from location to other,

    depending on the geological formation. Most health risks come from

    emanation of radon and its daughter due to its contribution for indoor

    radon, so the results showed that there is a linear relationship

    between the ratio of soil and indoor radon concentration (CSoil Rn222/

    Cindoor Rn222) and the effective radium content in soil samples. The

    results show that radon concentration has high and low values in

    Hajyawa city and Er. Tyrawa Qr, respectively. A comparison

    between our results with that mentioned in international reports was

    done.'
