  title: Effect Of Creeffect Of Creep Rate On Behavior Of Clay - Cement Soil.Ep Rate
    On Behavior Of Clay - Cement Soil
  abstract: This research is to investigate the time- dependent behavior of a clayey
    soil-cement. The traixial compression test was utilized throughout the test programs
    under the unconsolidated undrained condition. The undrained condition represents
    the controlling drainage condition in which a creep failure may occur. The undrained
    creep behavior of soil-cement was investigated. In addition to the cement content,
    three various stress-strength levels were examined. The creep time relation, effect
    of stress level on creep, effect of cement content on creep, creep rate, and the
    effect of creep on strength was studied thoroughly. Test results showed that creep
    strain increases with logarithm of time and stress level increase but decreases
    as the cement content increase. Also, increase in strength and modulus of elasticity
    augment after creep but, was affected by increase in cement content. In the other
    side, this research shows a particular stress level below which soil-cement sample
    will not fail; this is termed the critical stress level. Little increase in critical
    stress level was found with increase in cement content. Finally linear relationship
    appears between logarithmic of creep rate and time, the slope of this relationship
    was found to be independent of stress level. Creep strain decrease rapidly with
    logarithmic of creep rate for specimen of 0% and 4% cement content while insignificant
    changes in creep properties occurred in specimens with 8% and 12% cement content.
