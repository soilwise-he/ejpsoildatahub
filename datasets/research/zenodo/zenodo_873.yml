  title: Internet of things based automated agriculture system for irrigating soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This work describes the design of an internet of things (IoT)-based
    prototype system for outdoor agriculture farmland that employs low-cost sensors
    for detecting basic agriculture parameters such as soil moisture level, air temperature,
    and air humidity to irrigate the farmland automatically and manually while tracing
    the water volume. Therefore, since the water requirement varies according to plant
    type and plant growth stages, this research focuses on a feature where user can
    adjust the soil moisture level from software according to the plant type and age
    stages so that a suitable moisture level can be maintained for plants. Apart from
    that, the system also has a feature to adjust the temperature threshold limit
    from the application software so that when the temperature sensor value exceeds
    the respective threshold limits, it sprinkles the water for a limited time so
    that plants are not damaged due to overheating. Google sheets is used for cloud
    storage, and Wi-Fi is used to send data to the cloud using the HTTP protocol.
    The Blynk application software is used to monitor and control purposes.&lt;/p&gt;'
