  title: 'Influence of Soil Ph and Microbes on Mineral Solubility and Plant Nutrition:
    A Review'
  abstract: "<em>Soil pH is one of the essential vital features that increases or\
    \ decreases the nutrient availability in soil. The lower pH lessens the secondary\
    \ macronutrient availability while higher pH limits the available micronutrient\
    \ in soil. Furthermore, the pesticides efficiency, use of organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers sources to soil also required proper pH for maximum utilization\
    \ by plants. Therefore, soil pH is termed as \"principal soil indicator\" that\
    \ affect the biogeochemical cycles and has broader effects on the soil microbial\
    \ community. Mineral approaches used to alter the soil pH had demonstrated drawbacks\
    \ that it is too difficult to change. That\u2019s why alteration in rhizospheric\
    \ pH can be a practical approach. Hence, a microbial-breeding technique such as\
    \ genome replication of microbes may be a suitable approach to alter rhizospheric\
    \ pH. It might be possible that microbes genetic product releases too much acidic\
    \ or basic compounds that increase or decrease the pH of rhizosphere. Greater\
    \ exploitation of microbes in this respect would be essential to pursue, as they\
    \ have the ability to resolve several stresses in a more sustainable manner. In\
    \ order to breed the microbes selectively for optimal nutritional interactions\
    \ with plants, the genetic components of different traits must first be practiced.</em>"
