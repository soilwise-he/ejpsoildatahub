  title: Sustainable soil management in cereal-based systems; Coapplication of PGPR
    and organic fertilizers for improving crop productivity
  abstract: An upsurge in food demand due to increasing human population is coupled
    with intensification of agricultural production. In intensive agriculture/cereal
    production systems, higher inputs of mineral fertilizers have resulted in persistent
    decrease in soil fertility and release of greenhouse gasses (i.e. CO2, N2O, CH4).
    To address these issues; organic fertilizers and plant growth promoting bacteria
    (PGPR) offer reliable solution by their contribution in improving soil fertility
    and nutrient availability, thus reducing chemical fertilizers' application. In
    order to obtain high crop production under sustainable and ecofriendly management
    system, the present study combined the use of PGPR and organic fertilizers with
    reduced application of chemical fertilizers. For this, efficient PGPR were selected
    based on their different plant growth promoting traits (i.e. IAA production, P
    solubilization etc.). In seed germination assay, bacterial inoculated seedlings
    showed significant increase in root length and vigor index as compared to uninoculated
    control. In microcosmic study, application of PGPR consortium showed substantial
    increase in availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in comparison to control.
    Furthermore; under net house conditions, the co-application of PGPR consortia
    along with different organic amendments resulted in significant increase in plant
    physiological (SPAD chlorophyll readings) and growth parameters (root length,
    shoot length, plant fresh weight, dry weight and grain yield) in pots. Principal
    component analysis was used to analyze the response of co-application of PGPR
    and organic amendments on yield parameters (i.e. plant height, grain weight, number
    of tillers) of rice grown in field trials and pots. Application of reduced dose
    of chemical fertilizers along with organic fertilizers (i.e. Phosphorus Pool,
    Bio Power) and PGPR also showed positive correlation to the enhanced growth, yield
    and NP content in field trials. Conclusively, the integrated application of PGPR
    and organic fertilizers is an eco-friendly approach for sustainable soil management
    and improved/enhanced rice production with reduced dosage of chemical fertilizers.
