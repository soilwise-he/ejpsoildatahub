  title: SOIL WORMS POPULATION IN VARIOUS LITTLE QUALITY (C, N, C / N, LIGNIN, AND
    POLYPHENOL) (CASE STUDY ON AGROFORESTRY LAND IN KELIMUTU NATIONAL PARK, ENDE REGENCYINDONESIA)
  abstract: 'The agricultural business that is applied to the agroforestry system
    in Kelimutu National Park causes differences in the quality of organic matter
    of plants and earthworm populations, which have consequences for soil environmental
    services. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the earthworm population and
    the quality of plant organic matter in various agroforestry systems, intensive
    agriculture, and secondary forests. Sampling of organic matter from plants and
    earthworms was carried out in January - July 2016 (in the rainy season) in Agroforestry
    land: Clove (AF - CK), Cocoa (AF - KK), Candlenut (AF - KM), Coffee (AF - KM)
    ) compared to intensive agricultural land (monoculture vegetable crops) and secondary
    forests (SPL-HS), with 3 times repetition. Variables observed were in addition
    to the number of earthworms found and biomass worms (monolith sampling), also
    observed the quality of plant organic matter (C (Walkley and black), N (Kjeldahl),
    Lignin, and Polyphenol (Goering and Van Soest)) (Quadrants). The survey results
    show that the population of earthworms in SPL-AF is as low as the population in
    SPL-HS, an average of 3 m-2, while in the SPL-PI the average is only 0.24 m-2.
    Earthworm biomass in AF is about 69% smaller than worms found in SPL-HS; average
    earthworm biomass in SPL-AF 15 gm-2 while in SPL-HS an average of 47 gm-2; and
    the smallest worm biomass found in SPL-PI averaging around 2.3 gm-2. The average
    quality of organic matter of C-org plants in all SSTs was 38% to 50%, the highest
    C-org content of AF-CK, AF-KP and SPL-HS were significantly different (p 0.05),
    the average is 1.36% and 41.13%, respectively. The C / N ratio in AF - CK and
    HS is the same at an average of 52.78% or 58 times higher than AF - KK, AF - KM,
    and AF - KP, the average is 31.11% The polyphenolic levels of different plant
    organic matter significant (p 2% will slow decay'
