  title: "GIS Mapping of Large Soil Groups, Current Land Use, Soil Depths and Slopes,\
    \ Erosian in K\u0131r\u015Fehir Province of Turkey"
  abstract: "Abstract This study was conducted within the scope of the spatial evaluation\
    \ of the current land uses, large soil groups, soil depth and slope distributions\
    \ and soil erosion data in K\u0131r\u015Fehir province of Turkey. In the study,\
    \ digital soil maps produced by the Abolished General Directorate of Rural Services\
    \ in Turkey were used. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) (Arc GIS 10.3.1)\
    \ software was used for the spatial evaluation of soil data in the study. According\
    \ to the spatial analysis results; Dry marginal agricultural areas with 2857.7\
    \ km2 constitute a large part of the current land use of K\u0131r\u015Fehir Province.\
    \ This area covers 44% of the total. When the large soil groups of K\u0131r\u015F\
    ehir province are examined, brown soils constitute a large part of the region.\
    \ It has been determined that brown soils correspond to 2710.4 km2 area and 41%\
    \ of the existing area. The soil depth structure has been observed to be generally\
    \ medium depth soils. Medium deep soils have an area of 2052.1 km2 and constitute\
    \ 31% of the total area. As for the soil slope class, it was seen that a large\
    \ part of the region was between the 2nd degree slope group (7-12%) and the 3rd\
    \ degree slope group (13-20%). When the soil erosion degree was examined, it was\
    \ seen that a large part of the region had 2nd degree erosion. Soils with 2nd\
    \ degree erosion group constitute an area of 2294.3 km2 (35%). Sharing the digital\
    \ land use data obtained in the study will provide significant contributions to\
    \ the investor organizations that will invest in the region and contribute to\
    \ agricultural production."
