  title: THE EFFECT OF BOKASHI AND THEIR INCUBATION PERIOD ON SOME CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
    OF ULTISOLS SOIL
  abstract: "The objectives of the research were: to determine some of the chemical\
    \ properties of bokashi (swiftletpoop, banana peels, and tea dregs) and to determine\
    \ the effect of giving different types of bokashi and their incubation time on\
    \ some of the chemical properties of Ultisols soil. This research was conducted\
    \ from February \u2013 to March 2021 in the Jl. Talang Sari. Samarinda. East Kalimantan\
    \ and analysis of bokashi fertilizer and soil was carried out at the Soil Laboratory,\
    \ Faculty of Agriculture, Mulawarman University, Samarinda. The research treatments\
    \ consisted of: without giving bokashi (p0), giving swiftletpoop bokashi (p1),\
    \ giving banana peel bokashi (p2), and giving tea dregs bokashi (p3) where each\
    \ bokashi type treatment was incubated for 2 weeks and 4 weeks. . The research\
    \ activities included: (1) making swiftletpoop bokashi, banana peel bokashi, and\
    \ tea dregs bokashi, (2) Ultisol soil media preparation and treatment of bokashi\
    \ types (swiftletpoop bokashi, banana peel waste, and tea dregs waste) and incubation\
    \ for 2 and 4 weeks, (3) analysis of some chemical properties of bokashi fertilizer,\
    \ and (4) analysis of soil after incubation for each type of bokashi fertilizer\
    \ treatment. The results showed that: (1) bokashi fertilizer incubated for 4 weeks\
    \ in Ultisols soil resulted in higher soil pH, C-organic content, N-total, available\
    \ P and available K and higher C/N ratio compared to the incubation period. for\
    \ 2 weeks; (2) Application of bokashi fertilizer on Ultisols soil increased soil\
    \ pH, C-organic content, N-total, available P and available K and C/N ratio of\
    \ Ultisols soil compared to no bokashi fertilizer; and (3) Application of bokashi\
    \ fertilizer with swiftletpoop resulted in the highest total organic C and N,\
    \ application of banana peel bokashi fertilizer resulted in the highest soil pH\
    \ and available P, while tea dregs bokashi application resulted in the highest\
    \ C/N ratio."
