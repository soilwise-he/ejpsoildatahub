  abstract: In this article talk about, on the basis of the integration of Sciences
    in the formation of ecological culture of youth, the implementation of the creative
    reduction to the solution of today's problems. In the process of coordination
    and harmonization of interaction and interaction of nature and society with the
    current period, where the development of Science and technology is accelerated,
    such environmental problems arise, they are interpreted as the actual problems

    but they arose under the influence of anthropogen factor-human activity.
