  title: 'Towards a Canary Islands barcode database for soil biodiversity: revealing
    cryptic and unrecorded mite species diversity within insular soils'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil arthropod diversity contributes to a high proportion of
    the total biodiversity on Earth. However, most soil arthropods are still undescribed,
    hindering our understanding of soil functioning and global biodiversity estimations.
    Inventorying soil arthropods using conventional taxonomical approaches is particularly
    difficult and costly due to the great species richness, abundance and local-scale
    heterogeneity of mesofauna communities and the poor taxonomic background knowledge
    of most lineages. To alleviate this situation, we have designed and implemented
    a molecular barcoding framework adapted to soil fauna. This pipeline includes
    different steps, starting with a morphology-based selection of specimens which
    are imaged. Then, DNA is extracted non-destructively. Both images and voucher
    specimens are used to assign a taxonomic identification, based on morphology that
    is further checked for consistency with molecular information. Using this procedure,
    we studied 239 specimens of mites from the Canary Islands including representatives
    of Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes, of which we recovered barcode
    sequences for 168 specimens that were morphologically identified to 49 species,
    with nine specimens that could only be identified at the genus or family levels.
    Multiple species delimitation analyses were run to compare molecular delimitations
    with morphological identifications, including ASAP, mlPTP, BINs and 3% and 8%
    genetic distance thresholds. Additionally, a species-level search was carried
    out at the Biodiversity Databank of the Canary Islands (BIOTA) to evaluate the
    number of species in our dataset that were not previously recorded in the archipelago.
    In parallel, a sequence-level search of our sequences was performed against BOLD
    Systems. Our results reveal that multiple morphologically identified species correspond
    to different molecular lineages, which points to significant levels of unknown
    cryptic diversity within the archipelago. In addition, we evidenced that multiple
    species in our dataset constituted new records for the Canary Islands fauna and
    that the information for these lineages within online genetic repositories is
    very incomplete. Our study represents the first systematic effort to catalogue
    the soil arthropod mesofauna of the Canary Islands and establishes the basis for
    the Canary Islands Soil Biodiversity barcode database. This resource will constitute
    a step forward in the knowledge of these arthropods in a region of special interest.&lt;/p&gt;'
