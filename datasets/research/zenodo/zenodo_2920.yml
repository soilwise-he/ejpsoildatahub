  title: Effects of drought stress on early seedling growth and ecophysiology of beans,
    pepper, tomato and watermelon grown in screenhouse-potted soil
  abstract: "With changing rainfall patterns, deforestation and degradation of arable\
    \ land, freshwater resources for irrigation are reducing, increasing the potential\
    \ for drought stress on crops. The aim of this research was to study the growth\
    \ and ecophysiological responses of beans, pepper, tomato and watermelon potted\
    \ and grown in screenhouse under varied irrigation, for 14 days. There were three\
    \ treatments: zero irrigation after seedling establishment, 0.1 L/pot/week, 0.2\
    \ L/pot/week and 0.3 L/pot/week respectively, each pot with three plants, in a\
    \ completely randomized design with 3 replicates. Growth and ecophysiological\
    \ measurements were recorded for the first three weeks of growth. ANOVA and Pearson\
    \ Correlation were conducted, with significance at \u03B1 0.05. Plants with zero\
    \ irrigation had the least growth in all parameters measured; growth was stimulated\
    \ by irrigation, with a threshold at 0.2 L/week (corresponding to 2200 mm, the\
    \ mean annual rainfall for the region) for pepper, tomato and watermelon seedlings.\
    \ Biomass accumulation in all species increased with irrigation but WUE decreased.\
    \ The quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry of beans and watermelon\
    \ increased to 0.8 as irrigation increased, while pepper and tomato remained low\
    \ in all treatments, indicating stress. These results show that early seedling\
    \ stages are sensitive to drought; however, beans and watermelon seedlings were\
    \ more resistant to soil moisture deficit than tomato and pepper seedlings. Early\
    \ farm management should consider appropriate irrigation volumes for better and\
    \ more vigorous crops in the field. This is essential in a future where irrigation\
    \ water deficits are predicted to increase during the cropping seasons."
