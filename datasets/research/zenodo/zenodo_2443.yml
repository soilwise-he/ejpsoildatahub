  title: Effect of some organic compounds on the mobility of some trace metals through
    soil amended with fly ash
  abstract: 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Z. H. College of Engineering &amp; Technology,
    Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh-202 002, India Department of Chemistry, Aligarh
    Muslim University, Aligarh-202 002, India <em>Manuscript received R June 1999,
    revised 21 February 2000, accepted 3 March 2000</em> The effects of some organic
    compounds, viz. formic acid, acetic acid, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
    acetone and ethyl methyl ketone on the mobility of some trace metals, viz. Co,
    Zn, Cu, Ag and Pb through soil amended with fly ash have been invstigated in an
    alkaline fine sandy loam soil of Aligarh district (U.P.). The results indicate
    decrease in the mobility of trace metals with increasing dosage of fly ash in
    soil but with a variation in intensity by use of organic compound as a mobile
    phase. The mobility order is Co &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Ag &gt; Pb in case of organic
    acids and alcohols, and Co &gt; Cu &gt; Zn &gt; Ag &gt; Ph for aldehydes and ketones.
    The effect of organic chemicals on the translocation of metals follows the sequence
    : formic acid &gt; acetic acid &gt; methanol &gt; acetone &gt; formaldehyde &gt;
    ethyl methyl ketone &gt; acetaldehyde &gt; ethanol.'
