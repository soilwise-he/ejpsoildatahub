  title: CHANGES IN SOIL HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF AN ULTISOL IN RESPONSE TO BIOCHAR
    APPLICATION IN ILE-IFE, NIGERIA.
  abstract: "This study determined effects of wood biochar on soil hydraulic conductivity\
    \ (k) of two soil<br> series classified as Ultisol. The experiments were conducted\
    \ at the Screenhouse of Obafemi<br> Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State,\
    \ Nigeria. The treatments consisted of four<br> rates of milled local biochar\
    \ (0, 450, 900 and 1344 kg/ha) arranged in a Randomized<br> Complete Block Design\
    \ with four replicates. Surface (0-15 cm depth) soil of Iwo and Egbeda<br> soil\
    \ series were collected from the Teaching and Research Farm, OAU. The experiment\
    \ was<br> carried out over a period of 12 weeks in the screenhouse. The antecedent\
    \ soil properties were<br> determined in the University\u2019s Soil Science Laboratory\
    \ and k was determined using disk<br> infiltrometer. The data generated were subjected\
    \ to analysis of variance and the significant<br> means were separated using Duncan\u2019\
    s Multiple Range Test at 95% levels of probability.<br> Results showed that biochar\
    \ addition significantly improved soil hydraulic conductivity (K0.5<br> and K_2\
    \ cm at 450 kg/ha and 900 kg/ha) of the two soil series. The peak values for K0.5\
    \ (0.013<br> cm/s) of Iwo series were observed at both 450 kg/ha and 900 kg/ha\
    \ while it was 0.024 cm/s<br> for coarser Egbeda series. The highest K_2 cm were\
    \ 0.009 cm/s and 0.026 cm/s for Iwo and<br> Egbeda series at 450 kg/ha, respectively.\
    \ Further, saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil<br> treated with biochar at\
    \ 450 kg/ha was one of the highest. Overall, biochar addition at rate of<br> 450\
    \ and 900 kg/ha appeared to be more beneficial to adequately improving movement\
    \ of<br> water in the soil."
