  title: Soil Salt Accumulation, Physiological Responses, and Yield Simulation of
    Winter Wheat to Alternate Saline and Fresh Water Irrigation in the North China
    Plain
  abstract: "Large amounts of shallow underground water typically with salt content\
    \ at around 4.7 dS m<sup>\u22121</sup> are available in the North Chain Plain\
    \ (NCP), which requires managing and thus can be properly used in irrigated agriculture\
    \ to relieve the increasing pressure on fresh water in this region for supplementary\
    \ irrigation. Field experiments were conducted to investigate the soil salt accumulation,\
    \ responses, and yield simulation of winter wheat to the alternate irrigation\
    \ strategies during 2017\u20132019. Five irrigation strategies included rain-fed\
    \ cultivation (NI), fresh and saline water irrigation (FS), fresh water irrigation\
    \ (FF), saline water irrigation (SS), and saline and fresh water irrigation (SF)\
    \ during the growth stages. Irrigation with saline water increased soil salinity\
    \ level and could be balanced annually; however, the leaf gas exchange of winter\
    \ wheat was almost not significantly affected. The salinity caused by saline water\
    \ irrigation negatively influenced the vegetative growth. The grain yield was\
    \ increased by 24% and 32% under the FS and SF treatments compared to NI, while\
    \ a minor reduction by 12% and 5% in yield under these treatments was recorded\
    \ compared with the FF treatment. The SALTMED model was calibrated and validated\
    \ to predict yield, and the high value of the R<sup>2</sup> reflected a good agreement\
    \ between modeled and observed values, indicating that the SALTMED model was able\
    \ to simulate grain yield under the alternate irrigation strategies in the regional\
    \ climate condition. Supplementary irrigation using saline water at the stem elongation\
    \ stage and fresh water at the flowering stage is a practical solution to achieve\
    \ comparable yields with low risk of salt accumulation for winter wheat particularly\
    \ in the NCP."
