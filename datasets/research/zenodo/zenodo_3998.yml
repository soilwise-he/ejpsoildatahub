  title: 'Long-term contrasting tillage in Cambisol: effect on water-stable aggregates,
    macropore network and soil chemical properties'
  abstract: 'The aggregate stability of the soil is subject to theinfluence of anthropogenic
    factors and is of great interest all overthe world. The research aimed to quantify
    the correlations betweensoil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus,
    and totalpotassium, soil macropore parameters and water-stable aggregatesunder
    no-tillage and conventional tillage in Cambisol. The contentof water-stable aggregates
    and macroporosity tended to increasein the following order: conventional tillage
    (returned residues)< conventional tillage (removed residues) < no-tillage (removedresidues)
    < no-tillage (returned residues) in both fertilizations.The relationships between
    total nitrogen and various soil factorswere investigated: soil organic carbon
    (r = 0.65, p < 0.05), totalphosphorus (r = 0.65, p < 0.05), were statistically
    significant. Soilorganic carbon and total nitrogen were positively correlated
    withwater-stable aggregates (r = 0.81, p < 0.01 and r = 0.68, p < 0.05,respectively),
    whereas the relationship between total potassiumand water-stable aggregates was
    negative. The relationshipbetween total phosphorus and water-stable aggregates
    (r = 0.62,p < 0.05) was positive. The soil chemical properties, macroporesand
    water-stable aggregates that were averaged across theresidues and fertilizations
    were higher in no-tillage than in conventionaltillage. Soil organic carbon, total
    nitrogen and totalphosphorus all had a positive direct influence on the formation
    ofwater-stable aggregates under different tillage conditions. Sinceour results
    are largely based on correlations, the mechanismsof interaction between the soil
    chemical properties, water-stableaggregates and the formation of pores in the
    soil need to beexplored further in future investigations.'
