  title: Soil temperatures at Armagh Observatory, Northern Ireland, from 1904 to 2002
  abstract: "Soil temperatures at 30 and 100-cm depth from Armagh Observatory covering\
    \ the period 1904\u20132002 are presented. The series has been corrected for changes\
    \ in depth and location of the thermometers and has been compared with data from\
    \ two other sites in Ireland: Birr and Valentia. Linear regressions of the soil\
    \ temperatures over the past century for the three sites have positive slopes\
    \ in all seasons which vary from 0.04 to 0.25\xB0C/decade, depending on the season,\
    \ depth and location. There appear to be some geographical differences, with relatively\
    \ shallow trends in winter in Armagh and Birr and steeper trends in Valentia.\
    \ Soil temperature variations at the Armagh Observatory are intimately related\
    \ to changes in the mean air temperature but are also influenced by changes in\
    \ precipitation. We show that winter soil temperatures at Armagh can be successfully\
    \ reconstructed from air temperature records."
