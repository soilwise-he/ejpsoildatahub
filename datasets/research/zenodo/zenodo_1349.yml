  title: Ameliorative Effect of Biochar Application on Selected Chemical Properties
    of Acidic Soil
  abstract: "This research was conducted at the screenhouse of Biological Science,\
    \ Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Nigeria, to determine the ameliorative\
    \ effect of biochar application on selected chemical properties of acidic soil.\
    \ The acidic soil used for the experiment was collected from Centre for Agricultural\
    \ and Pastoral Research (CAPAR), Dabagi, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto while\
    \ the biochar used was obtained from Labana Rice Mill, Brinin-Kebbi, Kebbi State.\
    \ The biochar was applied at rate of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 t/ha. The\
    \ experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design (CRD) and replicated\
    \ three times. Data were collected on some soil chemical properties and were subjected\
    \ to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and significant means were separated using Duncan\u2019\
    s Multiple Range Test at 5% level of significance. The results showed that successive\
    \ increment in biochar rates virtually increased all the soil chemical properties\
    \ tested for, with 70 t/ha of biochar rate significantly (p\u22640.05) higher\
    \ than the other biochar rates. A field trial of long term experiment with lower\
    \ doses of biochar rates supplemented with inorganic fertilizer should be conducted\
    \ in order to have more feasible doses of biochar in the remediation of acidic\
    \ soil."
