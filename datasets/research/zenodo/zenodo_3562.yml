  title: Scanning Electron Microscopic Structure Of The Bacillus Organisms Isolated
    From Soil
  abstract: "Soil has been defined as the region on the earth\u2019s crest where geology\
    \ and biology meet. From a functional view point the soil may be consider as the\
    \ land surface on the earth which provides substratum for plant and animal life.\
    \ The genous bacillus consists of aerobic bacilli forming heat resistance spores\
    \ they are gram positive but tend to be decolourised on gram staining. A scanning\
    \ electron microscope ( SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images\
    \ of the sample by scanning with a focused beam of electron. easily so that it\
    \ is gram variable or may be gram negative. the soil is collected from the mountain\
    \ regions of south india, the primary screening and secondary screening were done\
    \ and isolated organism is subjected to morphological and biochemical studies.\
    \ Colonies where fixed in formalin vapour for a period of 24hr. After fixing the\
    \ outer edge of the colonies were marked with dissecting needle. The agar was\
    \ removed. The colonies were then coated with gold \u2013palladium alloy to a\
    \ thickness of 500A 0 by means of vacuum evaporation. Then the colonies were viewed\
    \ using scanning electron microscopy. After that the chamber was evacuated to\
    \ 10(-5) torr the specimens were scanned using electron beam the electrons liberated\
    \ from the surface of the specimen were detected using a scintillation photo multiplier\
    \ system. The resulting image was formed on a cathode ray tube. Photo graphs were\
    \ taken with the Polaroid camera. At 3000x a small rode shaped, non- uniform distribution\
    \ of organism were seen. At 5000x the rods were more elongated and the arrangement\
    \ of colonies were non uniform. At 10,000x the colonies showed a length of 1.46micrometer\
    \ and 1.64 micrometer and the width of the colonies were found to be 630.1 nanometre\
    \ and 752.9 nanometre and irregularly arranged colonies. At 20,000x the rods were\
    \ found to be more elongated. Scanning electron microscope can be used to view\
    \ the organism isolated from the soil. The examination depends on the concentration\
    \ of cells in the soil. This limits the use of sem technique in soils with more\
    \ than 10-7 organisms per gram of the soil. Keywords: Soil, Bacillus organisms,\
    \ Scanning electron microscopy."
