  title: ISOLATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CELLULOLYTIC ACTIVITY OF BACTERIA AND FUNGI
    FROM THE SOIL OF PAPER RECYCLING UNIT AT PERIYAR MANIAMMAI UNIVERSITY
  abstract: Enzymes are mostly used for the production of food and pharmaceutical
    products and the major source of these enzymes are microorganisms, plants, and
    animals. The most important group of hydrolytic enzymes is cellulase. Here we
    use microorganisms to produce cellulase to get high yield at low cost and the
    microorganisms were isolated from the soil found at the paper recycling unit.
    The bacteria and fungs were isolated and identified using the standard methods
    and the bacteria were studied for its glucose concentration and the fungs were
    studied for the cellulase production. Totally 6 bacteria and 8 fungus were isolated
    and identified. Among the bacteria only Brucella canis, Enterobacter aerogenes
    and Eruvinia psidii produced high yield of glucose and the fungus Torula herbarum
    produce high yield of cellulase. Finally, we concluded that for the production
    cellulase microorganism should be the good source in addition to that paper recycling
    unit soil would be the new and effective source for the enzymes.
