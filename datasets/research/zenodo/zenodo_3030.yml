  title: Soil Respiration Dynamics, as a new approach in nature-based solutions for
    the reduction of greenhouse gas fluxes in the terrestrial biosphere
  abstract: "Soil respiration (Rs) is a major component of an ecosystem carbon cycle.\
    \ To quantify soil CO2 efflux, field experiments were conducted <em>in situ</em>\
    \ (2015-2017) with an LCi-SC soil CO2 flux system under three semi-arid ecosystems\
    \ in the Mediterranean as one of the main identified climate change hotspot. Mean\
    \ values of Rs rates showed that soil CO2 effluxes were significantly different\
    \ among various terrestrial ecosystems with higher Rs in semi-natural ecosystems\
    \ as under Steppe 1.739 \xB1 0.717 \u03BCmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (658.093 \xB1 271.336\
    \ g C m-2 yr-1) and under Forest 4.205 \xB1 1.731 \u03BCmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (1591.307\
    \ \xB1 655.066 g C m-2 yr-1) than under the natural ecosystem Garrigue 0.914 \xB1\
    \ 0.309 \u03BCmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (345.887 \xB1 116.935 g C m-2 yr-1). It appears\
    \ that soil CO2 efflux is highly ecosystem-specific, so it is required to be verified\
    \ across ecosystem types.We recorded a very strong relationship between Ts and\
    \ Ws, as documented by the correlation coefficient (<em>r</em> = -0.848), respectively\
    \ <em>R</em>-squared (71.908%). Our results show that the natural ecosystem Garrigue\
    \ under climate warming could release less CO2 efflux than semi-natural ecosystems\
    \ and each semi-arid ecosystem can emit different amounts of CO2 emissions under\
    \ the same environmental conditions."
