  title: Genetic Improvement of Rice Through Molecular Breeding for its Efficient
    Utilization of Available Soil Nitrogen
  abstract: "To fulfil the demand of the global agricultural sector, which depends\
    \ on nitrogen fertilizers for half of its operating costs, global annual production\
    \ of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has surpassed 123 million tonnes and is continuing\
    \ to rise. Additionally, the current war of Russian-Ukraine soared the international\
    \ benchmark prices of N fertilizers more than threefold, which resulted into serious\
    \ negative impacts such as poor supply chain, trade flows and costs, as well as\
    \ inflationary pressures on global rice crop production. On the other hand, over-application\
    \ of nitrogenous fertilizers has several negative impacts on environment and human\
    \ health. Generally, lower than 30-50% of the applied nitrogen is utilized by\
    \ rice plants and approximately 67% is lost via different ways from the recommended\
    \ dose of 90-120 (N/kg/ha\u22121). Thus, there is an urgent need to genetically\
    \ improve rice lines with improved NUE. Despite of limited success of conventional\
    \ breeding, recent advances in molecular breeding offer great scope. Notably,\
    \ more than 500 genomic regions were reported to be associated with NUE in rice\
    \ and out of these, 12 meta-QTLs (located on chromosome 1, 3, 4, and 8) were found\
    \ to be major and having phenotypic variations of 11.0-30.1%. However, such QTLs\
    \ need to be validated before proceeding into the regional molecular breeding\
    \ program. An extensive field experiments was conducted with the mini core set\
    \ of rice 3k panel consists of 133 association mapping panel lines (AMPLs), 56\
    \ landraces along with 29 popular rice varieties to validate those consensus QTLs\
    \ associated with NUE. Results of these efforts will be presented during the congress,\
    \ which would be vital to adopt a novel breeding strategy to achieve a sustainable\
    \ rice production along with ensuring minimum negative impacts on the environment.\
