  title: The Effects Of Soil Parameters On Efficiency Of Essential Oil From Zingiber
    Zerumbet (L.) Smith In Thailand
  abstract: "Natural products from herb have been used in different aspects of life\
    \ as a result of their various biological activities. Generally, plant growth\
    \ and production of secondary compounds largely depend on environmental conditions.\
    \ To better understand this correlation, study on biological activity and soil\
    \ parameter is necessary. This research aims to study the soil parameters which\
    \ affect the efficiency of the antioxidant activity of essential oils extracted\
    \ from the Zingiber zerumbet in three areas of Thailand, including Min Buri district,\
    \ Bangkok province; Muang district, Chiang Mai province and Kaeng Sanam Nang district,\
    \ Nakhon Ratchasima province. The soil samples in each area were collected and\
    \ analyzed in the laboratory. The essential oil of Z. zerumbet in each province\
    \ was extracted and tested for antioxidant activity by hydrodistillation method\
    \ and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) assay, respectively. The results\
    \ showed that, the soil parameters such as pH, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus\
    \ elements and exchange of cations of soil specimen from Nakhon Ratchasima province\
    \ were the highest (P&lt;0.05) (6.10 \xB10.03, 0.15 \xB1 0.04 percent of total\
    \ nitrogen, 16.67 \xB1 0.46 mg/L, 3.35 \xB1 0.65 mg/kg and 12.87 \xB1 0.11 cmol/kg,\
    \ respectively). In addition, IC50 (Inhibition Concentrtion of antioxidant at\
    \ 50%) of Z. zerumbet essential oil collected from Nakhon Ratchasima showed the\
    \ highest value (P&lt;0.05) (1,400 \xB5g/mL). In conclusion, the soil parameters\
    \ are once important factor for the efficiency of essential oils extract from\
    \ Z. zerumbet."
