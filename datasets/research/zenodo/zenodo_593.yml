  title: Remediation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soil Using Selected Tropical Plants
  abstract: <em>This study evaluated the phytoremediation potentials of selected tropical
    plants, Glycine max, Panicum maximum, Sorghum bicolor, Tephrosia bracteolata and
    Vigna unguiculata, on 0%, 3% and 5% hydrocarbon concentration contamination. Top
    soil was collected from department of crop science garden, University of Benin
    at depth ranging from 15 cm to 20 cm using hand auger. Soil samples (5 kg) were
    placed in perforated buckets (cells) in different concentrations of 0% (control),
    3% (equivalent of 2530 mg/kg) and 5% (equivalent of 4562 mg/kg). This was replicated
    into total of 87 cells. Pre-planting of selected plants was done and transplanted
    into the cells two weeks after planting with 2 kg cow dung as augment. The study
    lasted for duration of 16 weeks; height of plants, number of leaves, roots length
    and leaves area were measured every fortnight. Soil samples were taken to laboratory
    every two weeks for total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation monitoring.
    The result revealed that the plant grew and increased in height. The number of
    leaves, root length and leaves area all increased with about 70%. The degradation
    result also shows that the plants reduced the residual TPH with an average of
    77% in 3% concentration and 81% in 5% concentration. The order of the plants remediation
    is in the range of Panicum maximum &gt; Glycine maximum &gt; Tephrosia bracteolata
    &gt; Vigna unguiculata &gt; Sorghum Bicolor. The plants are therefore recommended
    for remediation practice in contaminated sites within the Niger Delta region of
    Nigeria with cow dung as augment.</em>
