  title: An Experimental Behaviour of Clayey Soil and their Geotechnical Properties
  abstract: Expansive soil is a dangerous soil for structural designers in light of
    its low strength, cyclic swelling and shrinking behaviour. Expansive soil are
    making number of harm to the constructions especially in lightweight structures
    such as sidewalks and driveways, causing substantial harm during earthquake, floods,
    and so forth in order to use these soil in a successful manner appropriate treatment
    to the soil is required. The developing expense of conventional stabilizing agents,
    we are in a need for the requirement for the conservative usage of mechanical
    and agriculture waste for useful designing purposes. This idea incited an examination
    concerning the stabilizing capability of lime and fly ash in expansive soil. Index
    properties and compaction tests to be done in the examination.
