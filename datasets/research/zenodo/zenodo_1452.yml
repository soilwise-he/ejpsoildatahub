  title: Soil-Structure Interaction Effects On Seismic Behaviour Of Base-Isolated
    Nuclear Power Plants
  abstract: The soil-structure interaction effects between the structure and its geological
    medium become important for massive structures such as nuclear power plants. The
    present study investigates the effects of soil-structure interaction (SSI) on
    the seismic responses of base-isolated nuclear power plant (NPP). A comparison
    between seismic performances of the base-isolated NPP and rigidly fixed NPP to
    the ground is examined considering SSI effects. In this study, a nuclear power
    plant structure with total height of 65.8m is modelled as a lumped mass stick
    model and seismic isolation system is adopted by using lead rubber bearing (LRB)
    isolation device. To incorporate SSI effects the underlying soil medium is assumed
    as a homogenous half-space and modelled by the concept of cone models. Moreover,
    two shear wave velocities are used in SSI system to represent the real rock site
    conditions of NPP structures. The results leading to conclude that the effects
    of SSI on seismic performances of the base-isolated NPP are negligible than the
    rigidly fixed NPP rested on rock sites.
