  title: Effect of previous crops on soil fertility and yield of winter wheat in short
    rotation rotation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this article, information aimed at ensuring food security,
    which is relevant today on a global scale, providing employment of the population
    at the expense of jobs created in agro-sectors, as well as information aimed at
    increasing the income of the real sector and population. In the irrigated lands
    of the Republic of Uzbekistan, tasks such as selecting wheat varieties suitable
    for ecological conditions, optimization of cultivation technologies have been
    studied on a large scale and positive results have been achieved. According to
    the results of the study, under the influence of previous crops, the yield increased
    to 53.1-65.1 t/h, and an additional 3.4-15.4 t/h was obtained. Based on this,
    the widespread use and implementation of leguminous grain crops and intermediate
    crops in winter wheat short-row planting is one of the urgent tasks today.&lt;/p&gt;'
