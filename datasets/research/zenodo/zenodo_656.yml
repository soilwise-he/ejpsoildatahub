  title: 'Soil Solarization: As an effective method for nematode management'
  abstract: The usage of chemical pesticides for the control of diseases and pests
    including plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) is increasing from last many decades
    at an alarming rate. Its drawbacks include not only the huge cost and labour involved
    but also its adverse effect on the crop, soil, water and human health. Chemical
    methods are curative controls of pest but our approach must be preventive. The
    aim should be to prevent the pests and diseases that too with a technique that
    is suitable for a wide area, is cost-effective and ecologically sound. Soil solarization
    is one of those cultural practices that aims towards safe and long-lasting manner,
    and thus the production of crops.
