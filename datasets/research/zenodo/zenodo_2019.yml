  title: IMPROVEMENT OF SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND ENHANCEMENT OF YIELD WITH THE
    USE OF ORGANIC MANURES
  abstract: An analysis of field study was undertaken at Keela kadayam village in
    Ambasamudram Taluk, Tenkasi district of Tamil Nadu, South India in 2020 and the
    yield of rice measurement was done for the sandy loam clay soil which is situated
    at 8.72o latitudes and 77.68o longitudes. The analysis was highly focused to evaluate
    the possibilities of composting different organic manures i.e. Farm Yard Manure
    (FYM), Goat Manure (GM) and Compost Manure (CM). FYM, GM and CM were applied with
    and without three different concentrations like 8.5 t ha-1, 12.5 t ha-1 and 16.5
    t ha-1 in the field of the study and yield were measured. The result showed that
    the combination of FYM+GM+ CM in the concentration 16.5 t ha-1 recorded the highest
    yield of 7538 kg ha-1. The grain yield and yield components (plant height, no.
    of fertile tillers) of rice increased significantly with the application of organic
    material in the combination of F Y M +GM+ CM. After paddy harvesting, the available
    amount of all the major nutrients (N, P, and K) increased in the soil. The elements
    present in the samples before and after harvesting were identified by powder XRD
    studies were carried out for the samples. On the basis of experimental results,
    a recommendation for the farmers can be formulated that they should compost the
    crop residues and apply in their soils for the increased sustainable crop production.
    In this way, the soil fertility can be improved with a net improvement in land
    productivity and paddy yield.
