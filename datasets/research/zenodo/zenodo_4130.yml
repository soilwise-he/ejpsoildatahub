  title: The Effect Of Randomly Distributed Polypropylene Fibers Borogypsum Fly Ash
    And Cement On Freezing-Thawing Durability Of A Fine-Grained Soil
  abstract: 'A number of studies have been conducted recently to

    investigate the influence of randomly oriented fibers on some

    engineering properties of cohesive and cohesionless soils. However,

    few studies have been carried out on freezing-thawing behavior of

    fine-grained soils modified with discrete fiber inclusions and additive

    materials. This experimental study was performed to investigate the

    effect of randomly distributed polypropylene fibers (PP) and some

    additive materials [e.g.., borogypsum (BG), fly ash (FA) and cement

    (C)] on freezing-thawing durability (mass losses) of a fine-grained

    soil for 6, 12, and 18 cycles. The Taguchi method was applied to the

    experiments and a standard L9 orthogonal array (OA) with four

    factors and three levels were chosen. A series of freezing-thawing

    tests were conducted on each specimen. 0-20% BG, 0-20% FA, 0-

    0.25% PP and 0-3% of C by total dry weight of mixture were used in

    the preparation of specimens. Experimental results showed that the

    most effective materials for the freezing-thawing durability (mass

    losses) of the samples were borogypsum and fly ash. The values of

    mass losses for 6, 12 and 18 cycles in optimum conditions were

    16.1%, 5.1% and 3.6%, respectively.'
