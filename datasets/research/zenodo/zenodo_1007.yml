  title: Rooting inhibitors in soil solution under an intensive rice-cropping system
  abstract: This article 'Rooting inhibitors in soil solution under an intensive rice-cropping
    system' appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series, created by the
    International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication among scientists
    concerned with the development of improved technology for rice and rice-based
    systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each other informed
    of current rice research findings. The concise scientific notes are meant to encourage
    rice scientists to communicate with one another to obtain details on the research
    reported.
