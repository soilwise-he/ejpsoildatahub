  title: Bioremediation potentials of chicken droppings on crude oil polluted soil
    from automobile workshop
  abstract: "The bioremediation properties of chicken droppings on crude oil contaminated\
    \ soil from automobile workshop in Keffi Nasarawa State of Nigeria were evaluated.\
    \ Two experimental treatment (T1 and T2) with 10% and 30% chicken dropping addition\
    \ to the contaminated soil were set up. A control (T3) was also set up consisting\
    \ of contaminated soil only. The set up design was left for a period of 4 weeks\
    \ during which the total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) count, total petroleum hydrocarbon\
    \ degraded and gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GCMS) identification\
    \ of the residue hydrocarbon after remediation were carried out. Soil samples\
    \ remediated with 30% CD had significantly (p&lt;0.05) the highest THB in the\
    \ range of 6.45 x 10<sup>7</sup> -11.23 x 10<sup>7</sup> when compared with those\
    \ remediated with 10 % CD (5.34 x 10<sup>7</sup> -8.36 x 10<sup>7</sup>). The\
    \ non-remediated control had the least THB count of 3.45 \xD710<sup>7</sup> CFU/g.\
    \ There was a rapid and progressive reduction in the total petroleum hydrocarbon\
    \ during remediation in all the soil bio-remediated with 30% chicken droppings\
    \ compared to that of un-remediated soil. Automobile contaminated soil from Anguwan\
    \ Kwara are more susceptible to remediation had the highest TPH degraded of 22,\
    \ 39, 44 and 57.04%, at the end of the days 7, 14, 21 and 28 days respectively.\
    \ GCMS revealed a total of 12,14,8,9 and 17 residual hydrocarbons in soil samples\
    \ from Keffi Garage, New Keffi Hotel, Angwan Kwara, High Court and Angwan Tanko\
    \ automobile workshops respectively after remediation with 30% chicken droppings\
    \ while non-remediated soil recorded 22 residual hydrocarbons. The research shows\
    \ that chicken droppings enhanced bioremediation of crude oil contaminated soil\
    \ from automobile workshops."
