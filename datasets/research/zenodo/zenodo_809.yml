  title: A biobased, bioactive, low CO2impact coating for soil improvers
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Lignosulfonate-based bioactive coatings as soil improvers for lawns
    were developed using laccase as a biocatalyst. Incorporation of glycerol, xylitol
    and sorbitol as plasticizers considerably reduced the brittleness of the synthesized
    coatings of marine carbonate granules while thermal enzyme inactivation at 100
    &deg;C enabled the production of stable coatings. Heat inactivation produced stable
    coatings with a molecular weight of 2000 kDa and a viscosity of 4.5 &times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;
    Pas. The desired plasticity for the spray coating of soil improver granules was
    achieved by the addition of 2.7% of xylitol. Agriculture beneficial microorganisms
    (four different &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; species) were integrated into the
    coatings. The stable coatings protected the marine calcium carbonate granules,
    maintained the viability of the microorganisms and showed no toxic effects on
    the germination and growth of model plants including corn, wheat, salad, and tomato
    despite a slight delay in germination. Moreover, the coatings reduced the dust
    formation of soil improvers by 70%. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission analysis
    showed potential for the reduction of up to 3.4 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq.
    kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; product, making it a viable alternative to fossil-based
    coatings.&lt;/p&gt;'
