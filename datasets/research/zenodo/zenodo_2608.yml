  title: Effects of different levels of N and P on the yield of BINA dhan7 in old
    Brahmaputra floodplain soil
  abstract: 'A field experiment was carried out in Old Brahmaputra Floodplain soil
    at Soil Science Field Laboratory of Bangladesh<br> Agricultural University, Mymensingh
    during aman season of 2011 to study the response of BINA dhan7 to different levels
    of nitrogen<br> and phosphorous. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design with four replications. There were seven<br> treatments such as T1:
    Control, T2: Recommended fertiliser dose ( RFD) + N0P0, T3: RFD, T4: RFD-20% NP,
    T5: RFD-40% NP, T6: RFD + 20% NP and T7: RFD + 40% NP. The recommended fertilizer
    dose used for the study was 80 kg N, 25 kg P, 35 kg K, 10 kg S and 4 kg Zn ha-1.
    Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur and zinc were applied through urea, TSP,
    MoP, gypsum and zinc oxide, respectively. The application of N and P had a significant
    influence on plant height, effective tiller hill-1, panicle length and filled
    grains panicle-1. The N and P uptake by rice plant did not increase considerably
    due to the different rates of N and P compared to RFD. The grain and straw yield
    of BINA dhan7 were significantly affected due to treatments. The highest grain
    and straw yield were 5.47 t ha-1 and 6.58 t ha-1, respectively in the treatment
    T7 (RFD + 40% NP) where all of N and P fertilizers were applied in higher level
    . From this study it can be concluded that the treatment T3 (RFD) is the best
    for the successful production of BINA dhan7 in Old Brahmaputra Floodplain soil.'
