  title: Soil Cover Of The High-Heavy Belt Of The North-Eastern Part Of The Great
    Caucasus (In The Land Of Azerbaijan) And Its Rational Use
  abstract: As a result of the studies, such important indicators of soil fertility
    of the studied territory as the content of humus, gross nitrogen and phosphorus,
    the sum of absorbed bases and pH were determined. Soils of the highland zone are
    subject to various types of degradation, the main cause of which is the development
    of erosion processes. So, 52.8% of the soils of the summer pastures of the given
    territory are subject to erosion to varying degrees, of which 22.7% are strongly
    eroded. Under the influence of grazing animals, there is also soil compaction,
    which is associated with a decrease in porosity and a deterioration in the water-air
    regime. With unregulated and higher grazing in mountain meadow soils, the content
    of waterproof aggregates decreases by 18.4%, total porosity by 16%, water permeability
    by 4.8 mm / min, soil density increases by 0.47 g / sm3. On the basis of the studies,
    recommendations have been made on the rational use of the soil cover of the study
    area.
