  title: Effects Of Sole And Integrated Application Of Cocoa Pod Ash And Poultry Manure
    On Soil Properties And Leaf Nutrient Composition And Performance Of White Yam
  abstract: 'Field experiments were conducted during 2013, 2014 and 2015 cropping
    seasons at Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State, southwest Nigeria. The objective
    of the investigation was to determine the effect of Cocoa Pod Ash (CPA) and Poultry
    Manure (PM) applied solely and their combined form, as sources of fertilizers
    on soil properties, leaf nutrient composition, growth and yield of yam. Three
    soil amendments: CPA, PM (sole forms), CPA and PM (mixture), were applied at 20
    t ha<sup>-1</sup> with an inorganic fertilizer (NPK 15-15-15) at 400 kg ha<sup>-1
    </sup>as a reference and a natural soil fertility, NSF (control). The five treatments
    were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The
    test soil was slightly acidic, low in organic carbon (OC), N, P, K, Ca and Mg.
    Results showed that soil amendments significantly increased (p = 0.05) tuber weights
    and growth of yam, soil and leaf N, P, K, Ca and Mg, soil pH and OC concentrations
    compared with the NSF (control). The mixture of CPA+PM treatment increased tuber
    weights of yam by 36%, compared with inorganic fertilizer (NPK) and 19%, compared
    with PM alone. Sole PM increased tuber weight of yam by 15%, compared with NPK.
    Sole or mixed forms of soil amendments showed remarkable improvement in soil physical
    properties, nutrient availability, compared with NPK and the NSF (control). Integrated
    application of CPA at 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> + PM at 10 t ha<sup>-1</sup> was the
    most effective treatment in improving soil physical properties, increasing nutrient
    availability and yam performance than sole application of any of the fertilizer
    materials.'
