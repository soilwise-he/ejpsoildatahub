  title: Optimal control of plant root tip dynamics in soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to propose a novel approach to model the dynamics
    of objects that move within the soil, e.g. plants roots. One can assume that external
    forces are significant only at the tip of the roots, where the plant&#39;s growth
    is actuated. We formulate an optimal control problem that minimises the energy
    spent by a growing root subject to physical constraints imposed by the surrounding
    soil at the tip. We study the motion strategy adopted by plant roots to facilitate
    penetration into the soil, which we hypothesize to be a circumnutation movement.
    By solving the proposed optimal control problem numerically, we validate the hypothesis
    that plant roots adopt a circumnutation motion pattern to reduce soil penetration
    resistance during growth. The proposed formalisation could be applied to replicate
    such a biological behaviour in robotic systems, to adopt the most efficient strategy
    for autonomous devices in soil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;'
