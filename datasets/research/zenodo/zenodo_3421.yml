  title: A High Accuracy Measurement Circuit For Soil Moisture Detection
  abstract: 'The study of soil for agriculture purposes has

    remained the main focus of research since the beginning of civilization as humans-
    food related requirements remained closely linked with the soil. The study of
    soil has generated an interest

    among the researchers for very similar other reasons including transmission, reflection
    and refraction of signals for deploying

    wireless underground sensor networks or for the monitoring of objects on (or in
    ) soil in the form of better understanding of soil

    electromagnetic characteristics properties. The moisture content has

    been very instrumental in such studies as it decides on the resistance of the
    soil, and hence the attenuation on signals traveling through soil

    or the attenuation the signals may suffer upon their impact on soil. This work
    is related testing and characterizing a measurement circuit

    meant for the detection of moisture level content in soil.'
