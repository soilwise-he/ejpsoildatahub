  title: Short-term effects of non-grazing on plants, soil biota and aboveground-belowground
    links in Atlantic mountain grasslands
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Mountain grasslands in the Iberian Peninsula are the result of extensive
    grazing. However, a progressive abandonment of grazing activity is currently observed
    in the study region. The objective of this work was to evaluate the short-term
    (2 years) effects of non-grazing on the diversity and composition of plants, soil
    microorganisms (prokaryotes, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhiza), mesofauna, macrofauna
    and aboveground-belowground links, through the study of 16 grazed vs. non-grazed
    areas in Atlantic grasslands located in the Basque Country (Spain). Sites were
    divided between 4 habitat types with different elevation, pasture productivity,
    vegetation type and parent material. Herbivores appeared to influence plant community
    composition, contributing to increase aboveground diversity, while having unequal
    effects on belowground communities depending on the organisms analysed. This may
    be explained by the different habitat and trophic level of each soil organism,
    which may be more or less affected by the predominating negative effects of grazing,
    such as soil compaction, and only partially compensated by other positive effects.
    Finally, habitat type appeared to be the strongest influence on both above-and
    belowground communities, also influencing the effect of the absence of grazing.&lt;/p&gt;'
