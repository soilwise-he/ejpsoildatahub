  title: Estimating Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity From Soil Physical Properties
    Using Neural Networks Model
  abstract: "Saturated hydraulic conductivity is one of the soil\nhydraulic properties\
    \ which is widely used in environmental studies\nespecially subsurface ground\
    \ water. Since, its direct measurement is\ntime consuming and therefore costly,\
    \ indirect methods such as\npedotransfer functions have been developed based on\
    \ multiple linear\nregression equations and neural networks model in order to\
    \ estimate\nsaturated hydraulic conductivity from readily available soil\nproperties\
    \ e.g. sand, silt, and clay contents, bulk density, and organic\nmatter. The objective\
    \ of this study was to develop neural networks\n(NNs) model to estimate saturated\
    \ hydraulic conductivity from\navailable parameters such as sand and clay contents,\
    \ bulk density,\nvan Genuchten retention model parameters (i.e. r\n\u03B8 , \u03B1\
    \ , and n) as well\nas effective porosity. We used two methods to calculate effective\n\
    porosity: : (1) eff s FC \u03C6 =\u03B8 -\u03B8 , and (2) inf \u03C6 =\u03B8 -\u03B8\
    \ eff s , in which s\n\u03B8 is\nsaturated water content, FC \u03B8 is water content\
    \ retained at -33 kPa\nmatric potential, and inf \u03B8 is water content at the\
    \ inflection point.\nTotal of 311 soil samples from the UNSODA database was divided\n\
    into three groups as 187 for the training, 62 for the validation (to\navoid over\
    \ training), and 62 for the test of NNs model. A commercial\nneural network toolbox\
    \ of MATLAB software with a multi-layer\nperceptron model and back propagation\
    \ algorithm were used for the\ntraining procedure. The statistical parameters\
    \ such as correlation\ncoefficient (R2), and mean square error (MSE) were also\
    \ used to\nevaluate the developed NNs model. The best number of neurons in\nthe\
    \ middle layer of NNs model for methods (1) and (2) were\ncalculated 44 and 6,\
    \ respectively. The R2 and MSE values of the test\nphase were determined for method\
    \ (1), 0.94 and 0.0016, and for\nmethod (2), 0.98 and 0.00065, respectively, which\
    \ shows that method\n(2) estimates saturated hydraulic conductivity better than\
    \ method (1)."
