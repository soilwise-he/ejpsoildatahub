  title: Effect of tillage practices at different levels of soil moisture on some
    soil properties and maize productivity
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A field experiment was carried out during the early summer seasons
    of 2018, at Agricultural Research Centre (ARC) Giza, Egypt. This study aims to
    examine the effect of three tillage treatments under three different moisture
    contents on some soil properties and on maize crop production. The experiments
    included three moisture contents of (MC1, 27.2 %), (MC2, 15.4 %) and (MC3, 7.2
    %); as well as three tillage treatments, no-tillage control (NT), minimum tillage
    (MT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experimental was laid out in split-split
    plot design with four replications. The results showed that, there was significant
    effect of tillage at different moisture levels on soil physical and chemical properties.
    It was also indicated that the effect of tillage practices was significantly on
    soil bulk density, total porosity, hydraulic conductivity and moisture constants,
    where the conventional tillage at soil moisture level 15.4% (MC2) helped in improving
    soil bulk density, hydraulic conductivity and total porosity. Soil organic C,
    cations exchange capacity CEC, available N, P and K were improved in the soil
    surface layer of NT and decreased with depth. Clod mean weight diameter of soil
    was improved with 15.4-% of soil moisture content regardless of tillage depth
    and enhanced root proliferation by increasing density roots compared with minimum
    and no tillage in maize plant. The grain yields of maize were improving more under
    conventional tillage at moisture content 15.4% compared with other treatments.
    It was found that plant height and roots value increased by using conventional
    tillage compared with other tillage treatments.&lt;/p&gt;'
