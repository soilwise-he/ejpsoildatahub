    West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript received 11 July 2005, revised 27 October 2005,
    accepted 27 October 2005</em> A systematic investigation was made on the modification
    of soil known as stabilization for improvement of the properties of soils by controlled
    chemical treatment. The studies were made on Purulia soil stabilization by chemicals
    like NaCI, Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>. Inferences regarding the stabilization
    were drawn from the comparison of the change in thec soil index and engineering
    properties like the liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI),
    compaction compression index, shear permeability and consolidation characteristics
    etc. of the stabilized soils vis-a-vis the normal soils.Sodium chloride was found
    to be ineffective and sodium silicate was found to be beneficial to some extent.
    It may be due to gel forming ability and stabilizing innuence of sodium silicate.
    Physico-chemical interpretation has been given and inferences are drawn regarding
    the chemicals used for stabilization.'
