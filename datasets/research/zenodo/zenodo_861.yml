  title: Canopy influence on soil properties in Austrian pine artificial stands
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of the present study is to track changes in the canopy
    (cover-abundance of the tree layer) of vegetation and cover of the forest litter,
    and the relationship between them and the dynamics of soil parameters in Austrian
    pine (&lt;em&gt;Pinus nigra&lt;/em&gt; Arn.) plantations. The objects of study
    are 50-80-year-old artificial plantations of Austrian pine located in the xerothermic
    oak belt of five mountains in the area of Sofia. In each mountain, three test
    plots (SPs) were laid out, each measuring 400 m2 (Table 1). The main reason for
    choosing PP is the cover abundance of the first layer. Within each SP, the following
    metrics are measured: cover-abundance (%) of vegetation in each layer; the cover
    of plant litter (%). From all SPs, soil samples were taken from three depths:
    0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20 -30 cm. An analysis of the content of soil organic matter
    was carried out, including: total nitrogen (N), the C/N ratio &ndash; calculation
    method, the reaction of the soil solution (pH) in the aqueous extract and the
    mechanical composition of the soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the
    properties of the studied soils change to a significant extent in accordance with
    the cover abundance, especially in the first floor of the vegetation. Soil organic
    matter content, C/N ratio and mechanical composition are the indicators that most
    clearly reflect the relationship between the canopy and the cover of plant litter
    on the one hand, and soil properties. The proven, statistically significant differences
    in the values of these indicators emphasize the role of vegetation in soil-forming
    processes, the formation and change of soil fertility.&lt;/p&gt;'
