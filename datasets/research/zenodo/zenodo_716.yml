  title: Soil Characteristics That Influence Yield Reduction Under Drought Stress
  abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global food security. To mitigate
    the impact of drought, it is important to understand the environmental factors
    that influence yield reduction. Soil physical and chemical parameters including
    soil texture, compaction, organic matter content, and nutrient availability can
    affect water movement through soil and plant growth, affecting yield under drought.
    In this study, we used the EM38, an electromagnetic induction instrument used
    for mapping subsurface soil electrical conductivity, to map the soil of the IRRI
    retractable roof rainout shelter under drought stress. We also collected data
    on soil texture, organic matter content, and other soil physical and moisture
    related parameters. We used these data to develop a model of yield reduction due
    to drought stress. Our results showed that from 32 measured soil and drought-related
    characteristics, 12 were significantly correlated to yield reduction by drought
    and were subsequently entered in a stepwise regression for determining the best
    fitting combination of factors. Stepwise Regression predicted yield reduction
    as a function of % clay, cumulated percentage of the soil surface as cracks, cumulated
    depth of infiltration, and resistance to penetration at a depth of 30 cm. Our
    model can be used to predict yield reduction due to drought stress in other fields
    and possibly to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of drought on rice crop
    production.
