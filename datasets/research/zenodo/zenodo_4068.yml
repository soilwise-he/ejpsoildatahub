  title: Variations In Nutrient And Phytochemical Constituents In Leaf, Stem And Root
    Of Garcinia Manni Oliv. Domesticated In Tropical Soil
  abstract: Variations in nutrient and phytochemical constituents in leaf, stem and
    root of Garcinia manni (Oliv.) domesticated in tropical soil of Akwa Ibom State
    were assessed. Plant materials (leaf, stem and root) were collected from three
    (3) sampling locations in the study area. Elemental nutrient, proximate and phytochemical
    contents in the leaf, stem and root of G. manni were determined using standard
    procedures. There were significant (P &lt; 0.05) variations in contents of nutrient
    elements, proximates and phytochemicals in leaf, stem and root of the test plant.
    The contents of anti-nutrients (cyanide, phytate, oxalate and glycoside) were
    relatively lower in stem than those of the leaf and root of the test plant. This
    study suggests that the test plant parts could be used as valuable material for
    the production of pharmaceutical drugs.  In addition, the lower contents of anti-nutrients
    in the stem attest to its utilization as chewing stick.
