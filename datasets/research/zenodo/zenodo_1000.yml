  title: Contribution of anthropogenic phosphorus to agricultural soil fertility and
    food production
  abstract: "Agricultural intensification over the last few decades has been accompanied\
    \ by the extensive use of anthropogenic phosphorus (P) derived from mined phosphate\
    \ rock. Given the increasing scarcity of P resources, accurate estimates of the\
    \ reliance of agriculture on anthropogenic P are required. Here we propose a modeling\
    \ approach for assessing the contribution of anthropogenic P to agricultural soil\
    \ fertility and food production. We performed computations at country level, and\
    \ France was chosen as a typical western European country with intensive agriculture.\
    \ Four soil P pools were identified based on their bioavailability (labile versus\
    \ stable) and origin (anthropogenic versus natural). Pool evolution between 1948\
    \ and 2009 was estimated by combining international databases and a simple biogeochemical\
    \ model. An optimization procedure demonstrated the necessity of representing\
    \ a stable P pool capable of replenishing the labile pool within 14 to 33 years\
    \ in order to match country-scale observations. Mean simulated P pool sizes for\
    \ 2009 (0\u201335 cm soil horizon) were 146, 616, 31, and 156 kgP/ha for natural\
    \ stable, anthropogenic stable, natural labile, and anthropogenic labile pools,\
    \ respectively. We found that, on average, 82% (min-max: 68\u201391%) of soil\
    \ P (sum of labile and above defined stable) in that year was anthropogenic. The\
    \ temporal evolution of this contribution is directly related to the integral\
    \ of chemical fertilizer use over time, starting from 1948. The contribution of\
    \ anthropogenic P to food production was similar at 84% (min-max: 72\u201391%),\
    \ which is greater than budget-based estimates (~50\u201360%) commonly reported\
    \ in the literature. By focusing on soil fertility and food production, this study\
    \ provides a quantitative estimation of human perturbations of the P cycle in\
    \ agroecosystems."
