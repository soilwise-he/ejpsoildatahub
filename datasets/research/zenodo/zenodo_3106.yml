  title: Initial And Residual Effects Of Organic And Inorganic Amendments On Soil
    Properties In A Potato-Based Cropping System In The Bolivian Andean Highlands
  abstract: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of applications
    of organic and inorganic soil amendments on initial and residual soil chemical,
    physical and biological properties that may affect both short- and long-term soil
    fertility in a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-based cropping system of indigenous
    rural communities in the Bolivian Andean Highlands (Altiplano). Field experiments
    were conducted in four representative low and high elevation communities in the
    semi-arid Central Andean Region of Bolivia from 2006 to 2009. Treatments included
    a control, and applications of sheep and cow manure, a commercial household/urban
    compost product, a commercial biofertilizer soil amendment, urea and diammonium
    phosphate and combinations of these different treatments. Soil samples were taken
    from all the sites prior to application of treatments and planting of potatoes
    as well as during the growing season and prior to planting of a subsequent crop
    of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Willd). Soil pH, soil total organic C, and total
    N increased due to application of organic fertilizers with or without inorganic
    fertilizers. Soil inorganic N and Bray-1 P were increased by inorganic fertilizers
    alone or when combined with organic fertilizers. The residual effect of most of
    the analyzed soil nutrients was detected in the subsequent growing season. In
    addition, lower soil bulk density was observed after organic fertilizers were
    applied with or without inorganic fertilizers and this residual effect persisted
    for the quinoa crop. In a controlled laboratory incubation experiment, soil potentially
    mineralizable C and N increased as organic fertilizers application rates rose
    from 0 to 30 Mg ha-1. These results highlight the importance of a balanced soil
    fertilization program in this region with use of optimum rates of both inorganic
    and organic soil amendments to increase short- and long-term soil fertility.
