  title: Mineral concentrations in herbage and soil in a Pinus radiata silvopastoral
    system in north-west Spain after sewage sludge and lime application
  abstract: "Silvopastoral systems in north-west Spain can reduce the risk of fires\
    \ and promote multi-purpose forest land use. Fertilizer application is important\
    \ for optimal pasture and tree production. The application rate of sewage sludge\
    \ as a fertilizer is regulated and is based on\nits nutrient concentration, especially\
    \ nitrogen. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of three consecutive\
    \ years of application of different application rates of sewage sludge and inorganic\
    \ fertilizer, with or without lime (2\xC65 t CaCO3 ha)1) on the ammonium, nitrate\
    \ and\nexchangeable K, Ca and Mg contents in soil, and on the crude protein (CP),\
    \ K, Ca and Mg concentrations in herbage in a silvopastoral system established\
    \ under a 5-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don plantation with a density of 1667 trees\
    \ ha)1. The experiment was started\nin autumn 1997, when a pasture mixture was\
    \ sown (25 kg ha)1 Lolium perenne, 10 kg ha)1 Dactylis glomerata and 4 kg ha)1\
    \ Trifolium repens). Changes in ammonium and nitrate content in the soil in response\
    \ to liming and sewage sludge application reflected the initial pH of the\nsoil.\
    \ In general, liming increased the available Ca and Mg content in soil, and CP\
    \ and Ca concentrations in herbage, but reduced exchangeable K content in the\
    \ soil in the first year. Application of sewage sludge increased all of the measured\
    \ nutrients in both soil and\nherbage."
