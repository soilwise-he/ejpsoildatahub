  title: Assessment of Serviceability Fluctuation of RC Frame Building for Similar
    Type of Soil Based on Bangladesh National Building Codes (BNBC)
  abstract: Since the beginning of modern age, building a structure on a soft soil
    has always been a challenge for engineers. Apart from gravity loads, effect lateral
    load like earthquake load can vary due to soil type. The problem of soil-structure
    interaction in the seismic analysis and design of structures has become increasingly
    important, as it may be inevitable to build structures at locations with less
    favorable geotechnical conditions in seismically active regions. The study was
    carried out to assess the effect of soil stiffness and conditions on RC frame
    displacement based on BNBC 2006 and proposed BNBC 2015. The variation in structural
    displacement due to different cases is investigated in this research. The structural
    displacements based on BNBC 2015 are always greater than that of BNBC 2006 for
    all proposed cases, considering similar soil condition. For all soil conditions,
    maximum increment in deflection generated for case 5 while the lowest increment
    found for case 2, as the analyses were static linear consideration, the earthquake
    load greatly influenced by the seismic zone coefficients. As the second highest
    deflection occurred in case 2 with the least increment, the structural cost in
    case 2 areas would be comparatively high considering the other areas but the structures
    will be least critical for new code consideration when the other parameters are
    same.
