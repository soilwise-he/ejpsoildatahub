  title: THE EFFECT OF COMBINATION ORGANIC AND INORGANIC FERTILIZERS ON THE SOIL CHEMICAL
    PROPERTIES, GROWTH AND YIELD OF SEVERAL RICE VARIETIES.
  abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the combination
    of organic and inorganic fertilizers on the change of soil chemical properties,
    growth and yield of several rice varieties. The study was conducted in farmer
    rice fields in Bireuen Districts, Aceh Province from June to December 2016. Soil
    analysis was carried out at Soil Laboratory, Assessment Institute of Agricultural
    Technology, Banda Aceh. Factorial pattern of Randomized block design (RBD) with
    3 replications was used in this study. The first factor of the treatment consist
    of 4 levels combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers as follows P0 = without
    organic fertilizers + 250 kg ha-1 Urea + 150 kg ha-1SP-36 + 100 kg ha-1 KCl, P1
    = 5 ton ha-1 organic fertilizers + 225 kg ha-1 Urea + 125 kg ha-1SP-36 + 75 kg
    ha-1 KCl, P2 =10 ton ha-1 organic fertilizers + 200 kg ha-1 Urea + 100 kg ha-1
    SP-36 + 50 kg ha-1 KCl,P3 = 15 ton ha-1 organic fertilizers + 175 kg ha-1 Urea
    + 75 kg ha-1SP-36 + 25 kg ha-1 KCl. The second factor of the treatment consists
    of 4 rice varieties as followsBatutegi, Situ Bagendit, Situ Patenggang and Inpari
    30. The results showed that the treatment combination of organic and inorganic
    fertilizers increased C-organic, CEC, P-available, and K-available. The combination
    treatment of organic and inorganic fertilizers has not been able to improve plant
    growth, yield components, and rice yields. Rice yields in 5 ton ha-1 organic fertilizers
    + 225 kg ha-1 Urea + 125 kg ha-1SP-36 + 75 kg ha-1 KCl treatment was reached 7.00
    tons ha-1. Yields of Inpari 30 variety has reached 7.29 tons ha-1, which is not
    significantly different from Situ Bagendit and Situ Patenggang varieties.
