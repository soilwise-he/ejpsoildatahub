  title: Application status of red mud and prospect of lightweight foam soil
  abstract: "Abstract Red mud is a solid waste residue produced in the process of\
    \ alumina production. The total amount of red mud is large due to technological\
    \ reasons. And its elements are extremely complex, which can\u2019t be effectively\
    \ used, leading to a large amount of land is occupied and the environment is polluted.\
    \ This paper summarizes the research situation of red mud and light foam soil,\
    \ analyzes the application prospect of red mud, and makes some suggestions to\
    \ provide ideas for the research of red mud."
