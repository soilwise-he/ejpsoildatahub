  title: Effects of Biochar Application as a Carbon Substrate on Cotton Plant Growth
    and Some Soil Enzymes
  abstract: 'Biochar is a soil amendment that can influence many biotic processes
    in the soil. When applied to soil with low organic matter content, it improves
    the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil, thereby enhancing
    soil quality. This study was conducted to examine the potential effects of different
    ratios of biochar applied to a calcareous soil on the growth of cotton plants
    and soil biology. The study comprised four treatments: a control group without
    biochar application and three different levels of biochar application (3%, 6%,
    9%). As a result, biochar application increased the uptake of nitrogen, potassium,
    iron, and boron in cotton plants. It significantly increased the NDVI (Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index) and SPAD values used to assess the plant''s nitrogen
    status. By triggering an increase in the activity of nitrate reductase enzymes
    in the plant leaves, biochar application notably hindered nitrate accumulation,
    particularly in the case of the 6% biochar application. Additionally, biochar
    significantly increased the soil enzymes dehydrogenase and urease, contributing
    positively to the C and N cycles in the soil. The study results demonstrate that
    biochar application can enhance the uptake of plant nutrient elements from the
    soil and increase soil enzyme activity in cotton plants.'
