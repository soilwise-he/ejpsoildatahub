  title: Assessment of radon risk areas in the Eastern Canary Islands using soil radon
    gas concentration and gas permeability of soils
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The Basic Safety Standard (BSS) Directive 2013/59/EURATOM of
    the European Union (EU) has stated the need for member states to establish national
    action plans to mitigate their general population''s long-term risks of exposure
    to radon gas. Maps of radon-prone areas provide a useful tool for the development
    of such plans. This paper presents the maps of radon-prone areas in the Eastern&nbsp;&lt;a

    Islands&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote) obtained from
    assessment of Geogenic Radon Potential (GRP) distribution in the territory. GRP
    constitutes a magnitude that is contingent on both radon activity concentration
    and gas permeability of soils. An extensive campaign covering all geological formations
    of the Eastern Canary Islands was undertaken to locally sample these parameters.
    Geostatistical analysis of the spatial distribution of radon concentration in
    soils, permeability and GRP was performed on each of the islands, and the relationship
    between these magnitudes and the characteristic geological formations of the volcanic
    islands was investigated. Areas dominated by basic volcanic and&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn

    rocks&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(originated by both recent and ancient volcanism) exhibit
    relatively low levels of radon in soils, and with the exception of specific cases
    of very high permeability, these areas are not classified as prone to radon risk
    according to international criteria. Areas in which intermediate or acidic volcanic
    and plutonic rocks predominate are characterised by greater radon activity concentration
    in soils, rendering them radon-prone. Given these results, Lanzarote is classified
    as an island with low radon risk all over its surface; Fuerteventura presents
    low-medium risk; and Gran Canaria contains extensive areas in the centre and north
    where the risk is medium or high. This classification is consistent with the risk
