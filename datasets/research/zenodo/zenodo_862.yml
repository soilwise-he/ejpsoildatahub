  title: Major overlap in plant and soil carbon hotspots across Africa
  abstract: 'Terrestrial plant and soil carbon stocks are critical for regulating
    climate change, enhancing soil fertility, and supporting biodiversity. While a
    global-scale decoupling between plant and soil carbon has been documented, the
    hotspots and interconnections between these two carbon compartments across Africa,
    the second-largest continent on the planet, have been significantly overlooked.
    Here, we have compiled over 10,000 existing soil organic carbon (SOC) observations
    to generate a high-resolution (250 m) map illustrating the distribution pattern
    of soil organic carbon in Africa. The SOC map is then used as an input to understand
    the soil and plant carbon interconnections of Africa''s vast landscape under changing
    environmental conditions.

    Keywords: Africa | Landscapes | Soil Nitrogen | Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) | Spatial
    Scale | Above-ground Carbon | Below-ground Carbon
