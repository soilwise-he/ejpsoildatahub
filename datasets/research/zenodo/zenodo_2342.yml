  title: Dependence of proportions and seasonal application of saponite water suspension
    as ameliorant on acidic properties of soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Increased soil acidity remains one of the important problems
    in world agriculture, especially relevant for the Northern territories, Traditionally,
    it is solved using lime ameliorants. Searching for new ameliorants that are just
    as effective, but at the same time are more are more accessible to certain areas
    is a promising direction for the development of agricultural science. Saponite
    water suspension can become effective ameliorant to improve acidic properties
    of soil on the territory of the Arkhangelsk region (Russia). This is possible
    due to the unique properties of saponite, its availability and the presence of
    large reserves in the region. This article presents the results of an experiment
    conducted in the Kholmogorsky district of the Arkhangelsk region (Russia) on sod-weak
    podzolic loam tame soil to identify the effect of saponite water suspension on
    acidic properties of soil under a naked fallow condition. The experiment proves
    the dependence of the seasonality of application, the different proportions of
    saponite water suspension and changes in pH and hydrolytic acidity, as well as
    the estimation of the most effective proportions of saponite water suspension
    to improve acidic properties of soil and revealed differences in the influence
    of seasonal application on the manifestations of the deoxidizing ability of saponite
    water suspension.&lt;/p&gt;'
