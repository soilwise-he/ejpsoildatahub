  title: Stabilization of Black cotton soil using Fly ash
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Expansive Black cotton clay soils
    are widely distributed worldwide, and are a significant damage to infrastructure
    and buildigs.It is a common practice around the world to stabilize black cotton
    soil using fly ash to improve the strength of stabilized sub- base and sub grade
    soil. Soil stabilization is the improvement of strength or bearing capacity of
    soil by controlled compaction, proportioning or addition of suitable admixtures
    or stabilizers. The Black cotton soils are extremely hard when dry, but lose its
    strength fully when in wet condition. In monsoon they guzzle water and swell and
    in summer they shrink on evaporation of water from there. Because of its high
    Swelling and shrinkage characteristics the black cotton soils has been a challenge
    to the highway engineers.So in this research paper fly ash has been used to improve
    the various strength properties of natural black cotton soil.The objective of
    this research paper is to improve the engineering properties of black cotton soil
    by adding different percentage of fly ash by the weight of soil and make it suitable
    for construction. A series of standard Proctor tests (for calculation of MDD and
    OMC) and California Bearing Ratio (C.B.R) tests are conducted on both raw Black
    cotton soil and mixed soil with different percentages of fly ash (5%, 10%, 20%,
    30%) by weight. A comparison between properties of raw black cotton soil, black
    cotton soil mixed with fly ash are performed .It is found that the properties
    of black cotton soil mixed with fly ash are suitably enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;'
