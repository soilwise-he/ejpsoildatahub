  title: Growth Response of Palm Seedlings (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) to Applying NPK
    Fertilizer (15-15-15) and Dolomite on Acid Soil in Pre-Nursery
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research aims to determine
    the response of oil palm seedling growth in pre-nursery on acid soil to NPK fertilizer
    doses (15-15-15) and dolomite doses. The research was carried out at Educational
    and Research Garden of Stiper Agricultural Institute located in Maguwoharjo Village,
    Depok District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia from January to April 2023.
    This research used a factorial pattern experimental method which was prepared
    using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of two factors. The first
    factor was the dosage of &nbsp;NPK (15-15-15) fertilizer which consists of 0 g
    ( control) ; 2.5 g; 3 g and 3.5 g. Meanwhile, the second factor was the dose of
    dolomite fertilizer which consists of 0 g (control); 5 g; 10 g and 15 g. Each
    treatment was carried out in 5 repetitions. The number of seeds needed for this
    experiment is 4 x 4 x 5 = 80 seeds. The results showed that there was no signiticant
    interaction between the dosage of NPK fertilizer (15-15-15) and dolomite on all
    parameters. The dose of NPK fertilizer has an influence on the dry weight of the
    roots and &nbsp;the best at a dose of 3.5 g. Dolomite application has an influence
    on root fresh weight and leaf area with the best dose of 10 g/oil palm seedling
    in pre-nursery on acid soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
