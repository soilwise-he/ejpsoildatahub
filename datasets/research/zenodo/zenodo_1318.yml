  title: Use of Nanotechnology for the Removal of Agrochemicals from Soil and Water
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agrochemical contamination is a severe problem that damages
    the ecosystem and reduces the quality of life of the people exposed; to remedy
    this problem, nanotechnology is an attractive bioremediation alternative for these
    types of chemicals. This study emphasizes bioremediation actions such as investing
    in alternatives, for example, the method of photocatalysis using Titanium Dioxide
    (TiO2) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO), and alternatives that aid in the degradation of most
    chemicals such as sonolyisis or ozonolysis to improve their effectiveness are
    of great interest. In this paper, the uses of nano remediation to reduce the effects
    of chemicals in agricultural soil were reviewed and its use is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;'
