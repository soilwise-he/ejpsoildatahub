  title: "Soil Temperature Changes (1970-2019) in Uluk\u0131\u015Fla District in Turkey\
    \ by Trend Analysis Methods"
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong> This research was carried out in the context\
    \ of evaluating the temperatures at different soil depths observed as monthly\
    \ between 1970-2019 in Uluk\u0131\u015Fla district of Nigde province in Turkey.\
    \ In the study, maximum, minimum and average soil temperatures at soil depths\
    \ of 10, 50 and 100 cm were investigated. Sperman\u2019s Rho, Mann-Kendall and\
    \ Sen's slope method tests on soil temperature data were applied. According to\
    \ trend analysis results; The general average of maximum soil temperatures of\
    \ 10 cm depth was 22.0\xB0C, minimum soil temperature values were 6.9 \xB0C and\
    \ average soil temperatures were calculated as 14,0 \xB0C. The general average\
    \ of the maximum soil temperature values in 50 cm soil depth was calculated as\
    \ 16.1 \xB0C, minimum soil temperature values were observed as 11.5 \xB0C. The\
    \ general mean of average soil temperatures were determined as 13,8 \xB0C. The\
    \ general average of the maximum soil temperature in 100 cm soil depth was determined\
    \ as 15.4 \xB0C, minimum soil temperature values were calculated as 12.6 \xB0\
    C, average soil temperature values were observed as 14.0 \xB0C. According to the\
    \ changes in soil temperatures in different soil depths; It was determined that\
    \ there was an increasing trend in maximum, average and minimum soil temperature\
    \ values in spring, winter, autumn and summer."
