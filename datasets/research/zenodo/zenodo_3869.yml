  title: Physico-Chemical Analysis Of Coastal Soil Samples In The West Coast Of Kanyakumari
    District, Tamilnadu.
  abstract: Environmental pollution is an undesirable change in physical chemical
    characteristics of air, soil and water. Now a day all the pollutants are accumulated
    in coastal regions. Coastal soil contamination also occurs due to spill of effluents
    by industries. The present survey was made to study of the some physico-chemical
    parameters of soil at ten different places of kanyakumari district coastal region.
    This study carried out using field determination of texture and low cost electrochemical
    approach was used for pH, and electrical conductivity. The soil properties like
    organic matter, macro nutrients (N,P,K) and micro nutrients(Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe) are
    determined by Atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that soils in
    the coastal region are made up of sandy and silt, soil pH range from (7.6 to8.2)
    which are alkaline. Electrical conductivity of soil solution increased with increasing
    concentration of ions. Electrical conductivity range from (0.76 to 2.0 d S m-1).
    Available nitrogen range from (7.0to 41 ppm) , phosphorus range from (41.3 to
    50 ppm) and potassium range from (29 to 46 ppm). The micro nutrients such as zinc
    (0.30 to 0.70 ppm), copper (0.06 to 10.28ppm), iron (0.21 to 2.38ppm) and manganese
    (1.27 to 3.62 ppm) have variation in comparison to different areas.
