  title: Comparative Study Of Biochemical Parameters Of Trigonella Foenum-Graecum
    Seedlings (Methi) Growing Hydroponically And In Soil By Using Sewage Water
  abstract: Environmental pollution in present scenario has become a matter of great
    concern. Emitted chemicals and solid wastes from different industries have increased
    amount of contaminants in air, water and soil to hazardous level. The present
    study was aimed to evaluate effect of polluted water sources on water and soil
    properties. Our study results showed increase in pH of soil on addition of polluted
    water. Electrical conductivity of soil was changed when treated with sewage water.
    It can be concluded from present study that when polluted water reaches fresh
    water and soil then it affects quality of soil adversely.
