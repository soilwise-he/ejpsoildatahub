  title: Mohr-Coulomb and Hardening Soil Model Comparison of the Settlement of an
    Embankment Dam
  abstract: In this study, numerical analysis of an embankment dam was carried out
    to predict settlement behavior with the use of the Mohr-Coulomb Model (MCM) and
    of the Hardening Soil Model (HSM). The MCM was applied to all material zones of
    the dam and the HSM was used for four major material zones that occupied significant
    volume. The settlement response of the dam was similar for MCM and HSM for three
    material zones (clay core, sandy gravel and random fill), each having a modulus
    of elasticity (MOE) in the range of 25000 to 50000kPa. However, it was found that
    after the end of the construction, the MCM showed about 57% and 50% more settlement
    as compared to HSM when MOE of sandy siltstone varied from 70000 to 125000kPa
    respectively. The results regarding the dam settlement predicted with the HSM
    are in agreement with the findings in previous studies.
