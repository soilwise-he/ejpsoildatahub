  title: Phytoremediation of Heavy Metals from Soil Samples of Sugar Mill Effluent
    of Meerut Region, India

    Heavy metals pollution is a big problem of our environment and sugar mills contribute\
    \ a major part in it. When concentrations of heavy metals become above prescribed\
    \ limits (suggested by WHO, BIS, FAO-UN, CPCB etc.) in soil or water bodied, they\
    \ pose very toxic effects on the health of human and animals. The major heavy\
    \ metals are(Cd) cadmium, (As) arsenic, (Cr) chromium,(Hg) mercury, (Cu) copper,\
    \ and (PB) lead. The objective of this research is to assess the efficiency of\
    \ sunflower plant (Helianthus annus L) in the phytoremediation of heavy metals\
    \ from int this region and situation. Heavy metals are present in soluble as well\
    \ as insoluble form in Sugar Mill Effluent (SME) drain, these are comparatively\
    \ less soluble above 7 pH. The measured pH of the SME sludge/soil is 7.77 and\
    \ mostly heavy metals contaminants at this pH present in insoluble compound forms.\
    \ This sludge spread in nearby agricultural area and surrounding area with sugar\
    \ mill effluent, because sludge is presents in semi suspension form in sugar mill\
    \ effluent. Allsamples are collected from separate places in SME drain of study\
    \ area and tested by spectroscopic method (AAS method). Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy\
    \ (AAS method) based analytical technique can detect the heavy metals both quantitatively\
    \ and qualitatively. The heavy metals concentrations in the dried SME sludge/soil\
    \ before phytoremediation are detected as Cd 30 mg/kg, As 62 mg/kg, Cr 12mg/kg,\
    \ Hg 44 mg/kg, Pb 36 mg/kg and Cu 03 mg/kg and pH 7.76. We found that phytoremediation\
    \ technique is low cost, feasible, bestand does not produce secondary pollution.\
    \ In the SME dried sludge samples, only 2 sunflower seeds germinated out of 20\
    \ seeds sowed and only 1 sunflower plant grows out of 2 germinated due to toxicity\
    \ of heavy metals and other contaminants present in the dried sludge. The length\
    \ of the grown plant above ground level was 12.35 inches which is comparatively\
    \ very less than normal value of sunflower plant. Theheavy metals concentrations\
    \ in the dried SME sludge/soil after phytoremediation are detected as Cd 26 mg/kg,\
    \ As46 mg/kg, Cr 11.2 mg/kg, Hg 36 mg/kg, Pb 30 mg/kg and Cu 03 mg/kg and pH 8.52.Sunflower\
    \ plants have significant potential in decreasing the concentrations of (Cd) cadmium,\
    \ (Pb) lead, (Hg) mercury and (As) arsenic heavy metals from contaminated soil\
    \ sample of sugar mill effluent drain, remediation effect on Cr concentration\
    \ seems very lessand no effect on copper. When concentrations of heavy metals\
    \ are compared with standard permissible limits, it is found that dried SME sludge/soil\
    \ is highly contaminated with Hg, Cd, and As heavy metals. Thus, sludge of Sugar\
    \ Mill Effluent drain should not be allowed to spread in agricultural fields and\
    \ surrounding areas without proper treatment."
