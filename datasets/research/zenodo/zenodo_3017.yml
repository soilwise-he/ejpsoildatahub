  title: The Effect of Mass, Depth, and Properties of the Soil Below the Raft Foundation
    on the Seismic Performance of R.C. Plane Frames
  abstract: "Soil structure interaction (SSI) has been the subject of numerous studies.\
    \ The foundation soil has a definite effect on the performance of structures during\
    \ seismic excitation. Recent studies show that the effect of soil-structure interaction\
    \ SSI may be detrimental to the structure during seismic excitation. In this study,\
    \ the effect of consideration of the soil below foundation and its depth, and\
    \ the soil modulus of elasticity on the response of structures is investigated.\
    \ The number of mode shapes considered has an effect on the accuracy of the values\
    \ of structure response. A structural model consisting of an 8-story reinforced\
    \ concrete frame resting on raft foundation, and including the soil below the\
    \ raft is analyzed. The frame is analyzed using SAP2000 software, and time history\
    \ and modal analysis are carried out with varying values of both soil depth and\
    \ soil modulus of elasticity. The soil below the foundation is connected to the\
    \ raft elements by gap links. Gap element links are compression\u2013only members\
    \ with appropriate stiffness, which are active only in compression. Modal analysis\
    \ results show that the periods of vibration decrease as the modulus of elasticity\
    \ of the soil increases. Periods of vibration of the frame without the soil mass\
    \ consideration are less than those when the soil mass below the raft is considered,\
    \ and they increase with increased depth of foundation to a certain limit. The\
    \ structures response in the form of columns shear forces and story displacements\
    \ are also evaluated under the variable parameters considered."
