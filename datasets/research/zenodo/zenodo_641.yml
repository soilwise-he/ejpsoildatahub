  title: NITROGEN FIXATION IN SOIL NOT WHOLLY A BACTERIAL PROCESS.
  abstract: Fixation of nitrogen may not be wholly associated with bacterial activity
    as has hitherto been believed but can also take place under completely sterile
    conditions even with silica, zinc oxide, aluminium oxide, ferric oxide, etc. when
    they are mixed with energy materials such as glucose and others. The energy available
    from the oxidation is probably responsible for such fixation in the complete absence
    of micro-organisms, and the reaction in light is much greater than in the dark.
