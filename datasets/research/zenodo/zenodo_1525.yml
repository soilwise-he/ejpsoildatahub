  title: Fusion of Vis-NIR and XRF spectra for estimation of key soil attributes
  abstract: "Precision agriculture (PA) is an integrated solution to optimize the\
    \ application of farming inputs site-specifically to increase crops efficiency,\
    \ reduce resources consumption, and protect the environment. Recently, visible-near-\
    \ infrared (Vis-NIR) and X-ray-fluorescence (XRF) have emerged as efficient and\
    \ inexpensive proximal soil sensing (PSS) methods for assessment of soil attributes\
    \ in support of PA applications. The goal of this study was to explore the potential\
    \ of data fusion in accuracy improvement of predicting key soil attributes using\
    \ Vis-NIR and XRF spectra. More specifically, local weighted regression (LWR)\
    \ and partial least squares (PLS) regression methods were examined and compared\
    \ in prediction of the following soil attributes: pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorous\
    \ (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Besides the individual-sensor\
    \ models, we evaluated three data fusion approaches basedon spectra fusion (SF).\
    \ The first method concatenates the full Vis-NIR and XRF spectra before PLS (SF1-PLS).\
    \ In the second SF approach (SF2-PLS), the concatenation of the principal components\
    \ (PCs) of the two spectra types \u2013 each resulted from a principal component\
    \ analysis (PCA) \u2013 were used as input to PLS. The last proposed method, SF-CNN,\
    \ uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with input in form of a matrix whose\
    \ columns are the PCs of the Vis-NIR and the PCs of the XRF spectra. To evaluate\
    \ the proposed methods, a total 267 soil samples of nine arable fields were collected\
    \ and scanned in laboratory settings using a Vis-NIR and an XRF spectrometer.\
    \ For each soil attribute, the samples of six fields were used as the calibration\
    \ set while the samples of the remaining three fields were used for validating\
    \ the prediction models. The individual-sensor and SF models were evaluated in\
    \ terms of ratio of performance to inter-quartile (RPIQ), root mean square error\
    \ (RMSE), and Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC). The validation\
    \ results showed that PLS generally outperforms LWR. Also, the prediction accuracy\
    \ obtained from Vis-NIR spectra was better than that of XRF for all the attributes,\
    \ except for Ca. The proposed SF schemes, especially the SF-CNN, outperformed\
    \ the individual models in the prediction of all attributes, except P and Ca.\
    \ The best improvement of the prediction results, compared to the individual-sensor\
    \ models, was obtained for Mg (RPIQ = 1.60, RMSE = 6.88 mg/100 g, LCCC = 0.93),\
    \ successively followed by pH (RPIQ = 2.52, RMSE = 0.36, LCCC = 0.68), and Na\
    \ (RPIQ = 1.69, RMSE = 2.55 mg/100 g, LCCC = 0.65). Overall, the results of this\
    \ study suggest the CNN-based fusion for the prediction of the studied key soil\
    \ fertility attributes in order to enable making accurate decisions and control\
    \ loop in PA applications using high-resolution data on spatiotemporal variability\
    \ of soil."
