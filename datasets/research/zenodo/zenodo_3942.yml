  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The article discusses the use of manure and other organic fertilizers
    serving for plants as a source of mineral nutrients with the release of CO2, when
    decomposed, it saturates the soil air and the surface layer of the atmosphere
    contributing to the plant&rsquo;s air nutrition. For a well-known reason that
    recently, around the world, as an economically pure organic fertilizer of animal
    origin, they began to be used to prepare nutritious mixtures for obtaining environmentally
    friendly crop products from crops, while it would justify the economic feasibility
    of using its cheap preparation and rising prices for industrial fertilizers. It
    has been proven that the application of various types and doses of organic fertilizers
    for legumes and peppers helps to increase the content of organic matter, nutrients
    (NPK), humus, carbon dioxide in the soil, as well as increase the growth and development
    of plants in different periods of vegetation. It has been established that the
    higher the content organic matter in the soil, the more it emits CO2 under conditions
    of aeration and humidity, and the correlative high relationship confirms the contiguity
    and tightness between these parameters, where P = +0.94+0.04 (beans) and P = +0.97+0.02
    (pepper).&lt;/p&gt;'
