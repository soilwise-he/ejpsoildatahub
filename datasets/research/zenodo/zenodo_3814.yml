  title: Soil Resistivity Structure And Its Implication On The Pole Grid Resistance
    For Transmission Lines
  abstract: 'High Voltage (HV) transmission lines are widely

    spread around residential places. They take all forms of shapes:

    concrete, steel, and timber poles. Earth grid always form part of the

    HV transmission structure, whereat soil resistivity value is one of the

    main inputs when it comes to determining the earth grid

    requirements. In this paper, the soil structure and its implication on

    the electrode resistance of HV transmission poles will be explored. In

    Addition, this paper will present simulation for various soil structures

    using IEEE and Australian standards to verify the computation with

    CDEGS software. Furthermore, the split factor behavior under

    different soil resistivity structure will be presented using CDEGS

    simulations.'
