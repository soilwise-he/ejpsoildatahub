  title: Improving Soil Quality and Rice Productivity with Application of Local Decomposer
    Microorganisms and Liquid Organic Fertilizer in Rainfed Lowland Rice at Gunungkidul
    Regency, Indonesia
  abstract: <strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br> Soil organic matter plays a role in improving
    rain fed rice productivity. The<br> application of a combination of liquid organic
    fertilizer and decomposer microbes can<br> reduce excessive inorganic fertilizer,
    and increase nutrient balances in soil. This research<br> was conducted in rainfed
    lowland rice of Sidorejo village, Ponjong district,<br> Gunungkidul in 2016 wet
    season to determine the effect of local decomposer<br> microorganisms and liquid
    organic fertilizer on soil quality and rice yield. The eight<br> treatments of
    manure and liquid organic fertilizers and three replicates were arranged in<br>
    randomized completed block design. The results showed that application of LDM
    +<br> liquid organic fertilizer increased dry grain yield of 10.76% compared with
    no LDM<br> application. A single local decomposer microorganismcan increased grain
    yield of 8.03%<br> compared to without LDM application. The combination of LDM
    2 (fruit waste) + LOF<br> (rabbit urine + gamal leaf) + 60% inorganic fertilizer
    recommended dosage was not<br> significantly different with the same treatment
    + 100% recommended dosage of chemical<br> fertilizers. This means that combination
    of LDM 2 + LOF 2 could save chemical<br> fertilizer 30%, and increased microbial
    population of 37.65% compared to control or<br> treatment without LDM.
