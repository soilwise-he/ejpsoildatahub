  title: Elucidation of electrochemical reduction behavior of dinitro group containing
    pesticides Chlornidine, Dipropalin and Prodiamine residues in soil, water and
    agricultural formulations
  abstract: "Depatrment of Chemistry, Madanapalle Institute of Technology and Science,\
    \ Madanapalle-517 325, Chittoor Dist., Andhra Pradesh, India <em>E-mail</em> :\
    \ maachandu@outlook.com Department of Chemistry, Electroanalytical Lab, S. V.\
    \ University, Tirupati-517 502, Andhra Pradesh, India An electroanalytical technique\
    \ has introduced for the elucidation of reduction behaviour of dinitro group containing\
    \ pesticides such as Chlornidine, Dipropalin and Prodiamine by DPAd sripping voltammetry\
    \ on a hanging mercury drop electrode and cyclic voltammetry in universal buffer\
    \ as supporting electrolyte. The best adsorption conditions were found to the\
    \ reduction of dinitro group pesticides Chlornidine, Dipropalin and Prodiamine\
    \ at pH 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0, and an accumulation potential varied from \u20130.65\
    \ V, \u20130.60 V and \u20130.745 V with an accumulation time of 60 s, 40 s and\
    \ 50 s respectively. The effect of stirring rate, scan rate, pulse amplitude and\
    \ purge time were examined for the optimization of instrumental conditions and\
    \ observed linearity range at hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) with a lower\
    \ detection limit 1.94 \xD7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> M, 1.821 \xD7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>\
    \ M and 4.522 \xD7 10<sup>\u20136</sup> M respectively for selected pesticides.\
    \ The average recoveries obtained for Chlornidine, Dipropalin and Prodiamine in\
    \ soil and water samples ranged from 99.1 to 99.9%. The technique has been adequately\
    \ applied to the elucidation of Chlornidine, Dipropalin and Prodiamine in soil,\
    \ water and green gram samples around Srikalahasthi (Thottambedu and B. N. Kandriga\
    \ mandal) agricultural regions, Andhra Pradesh, India."
