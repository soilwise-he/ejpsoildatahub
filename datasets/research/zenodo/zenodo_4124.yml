  title: ISOLATION OF LIPASE PRODUCING BACTERIA FROM OIL AND FAT CONTAMINATED SOIL
    SAMPLES AND ASSESSMENT OF THEIR LIPOLYTIC EFFICIENCY TOWARDS DIFFERENT SUBSTRATES
  abstract: Lipases find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical
    industries as Biotechnologically significant enzymes. In this regard, an effort
    was made to isolate bacteria from oil and fat contaminated soil samples. Further,
    three pure bacterial cultures were characterized and their lipolytic efficiency
    towards different substrates was assessed. Bacillus spp. degraded olive oil effectively
    and sunflower oil was significantly degraded by Pseudomonas spp. Of the three
    bacteria, Staphylococcus spp. showed maximum lipolytic activity towards diesel
    followed by kerosene as substrates. Hence, we can infer that isolated Staphylococcus
    spp. can be used effectively in the bioremediation of fuel oil spills.
