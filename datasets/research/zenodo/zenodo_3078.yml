  title: Mrakia panshiensis sp. nov. a new member of the Cystofilobasidiales from
    soil in China, and description of the teleomorphic-stage of M. arctica
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In a study on the fungal diversity in Northeast China, twelve
    yeast isolates were obtained from soils collected in three provinces, Helongjiang,
    Jilin and Liaoning. Morphological assessment and phylogenetic analyses of the
    nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the D1/D2 domains of the
    nuc 28S rDNA (nuc 28S) gene of the 12 cultures placed them in the genus Mrakia,
    namely Mrakia aquatica, Mrakia arctica, Mrakia frigida, Mrakia gelida and Mrakia
    robertii. A total of three isolates represented a hitherto undescribed species,
    which is described here as M. panshiensis sp. nov. (MB 834813). The species M.
    panshiensis sp. nov. shares several morphological characters with M. niccombsii,
    M. aquatica, M. fibulata and M. hoshinonis. These species can be distinguished
    based on physiological traits and pairwise rDNA sequence similarities. The study
    also describes for the first time the formation of teliospores by previously described
    M. arctica.&lt;/p&gt;'
