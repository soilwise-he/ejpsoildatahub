  title: Enhancing the Performance of Three White-rot Fungi in the Mycoremediation
    of Crude Oil Contaminated Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Contamination of soils by petroleum hydrocarbon is on the increase,
    particularly in the oil producing areas of Nigeria. White-rot fungi have enzymes
    which are capable of turning these organic compounds into harmless substances.
    This work investigated the performance of three white-rot fungi (&lt;em&gt;Pleurotus
    tuber-regium, P. ostreatus &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; P. pulmonarius&lt;/em&gt;)
    for the remediation of different concentrations (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20% w/v)
    of crude oil contaminated soils with sawdust and poultry manure as bedding materials.
    Ten grammes of each of the white-rot fungi were separately inoculated in each
    bottle containing exhaustively cropped topsoil (200 g), rice straw (40 g) and
    wheat bran (20 g). Each treatment was conducted in three replicates and arranged
    in a 3 x 6 x 3 complete randomised design. The bottles (54) were incubated for
    zero, one and three months in a dark room, exposed to light, watered daily thereafter
    for twelve days for fruiting bodies to spring out and harvested. &lt;em&gt;P.
    ostreatus&lt;/em&gt; had best agronomic performance and &lt;em&gt;P. tuber-regium&lt;/em&gt;
    removed hydrocarbons and heavy metals more than either &lt;em&gt;P. ostreatus&lt;/em&gt;
    or &lt;em&gt;P. pulmonarius&lt;/em&gt; under similar experimental conditions.
    The yield and mycoremedial performance of the three tested white-rot fungi demonstrated
    potentials for cleaning-up petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil, but their
    performance reduced from 5.0% (w/v) crude oil substrate contamination.&lt;/p&gt;'
