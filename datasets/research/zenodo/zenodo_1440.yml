  title: Effects of Different Soil Amendments on Mixed Heavy Metals Contamination
    in Vetiver Grass
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Three different types of low cost soil amendments, namely, EDTA,\
    \ elemental S and N-fertilizer, were investigated with Vetiver grass,\_&lt;em&gt;Vetiveria\
    \ zizanioides&lt;/em&gt;\_(Linn.) Nash growing under highly mixed Cd\u2013Pb contamination\
    \ conditions. A significant increase (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;\u2009&lt;\u2009&lt;em&gt;0.05&lt;/em&gt;)\
    \ in Cd and Pb accumulation were recorded in the shoots of all EDTA and N-fertilizer\
    \ assisted treatments. The accumulation of Cd in 25\_mmol EDTA/kg soil and 300\_\
    mmol N/kg soil showed relatively higher translocation factor (1.72 and 2.15) and\
    \ percentage metal efficacy (63.25\u2009% and 68.22\u2009%), respectively, compared\
    \ to other treatments. However, it was observed that the increased application\
    \ of elemental S may inhibit the availability of Pb translocation from soil-to-root\
    \ and root-to-shoot. The study suggests that viable application of 25\_mmol EDTA/kg,\
    \ 300\_mmol N/kg and 20\_mmol S/kg soil have the potential to be used for soil\
    \ amendment with Vetiver grass growing under contaminated mixed Cd\u2013Pb soil\
    \ conditions.&lt;/p&gt;"
