  title: Validation of the temperature of sandy soil in the block of the active layer
    of the land of the INM RAS-MSU model according to field observations
  abstract: 'The soil temperature is one of the most important characteristics of
    climatic, soil-forming, permafrost and engineering-geological conditions. It determines
    the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, allowing us to determine the sensitivity
    of landscapes to anthropogenic impact, changes in the natural environment and
    climate fluctuations.<br> The study of real natural processes, phenomena and objects
    using the methods of mathematical modeling is topical. Interest is dictated by
    the growing attention of the scientific community to the problem of global warming.<br>
    The reproduction of the temperature regime in the soil is an important problem
    for further research. Particularly, studying the thermodynamic processes in soils
    and the assessment of their reproduction in models are important objectives. This
    work is aimed at comparing the results of modeling the temperature regime of soils
    with data from field observations. The block of models of the active layer of
    land is used in the INM RAS-MSU climate model.<br> Computational experiments require
    information on atmospheric forcing (ERA-5 reanalysis), as well as soil and hydrophysical
    characteristics, which, to fully support the model, were taken from the Global
    Soil Dataset for Earth System Models). The temperature data of sandy soil obtained
    with the help of atmospheric-soil measuring complexes [5] installed by the employees
    of the V. B. Sochava Institute of Geography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian
    Academy of Sciences in different landscapes of the Tunkinskaya depression (Republic
    of Buryatia) were used as reference information. The measurements are carried
    out from October 13, 2011 to the present with an hourly interval.<br> Checking
    the adequacy of the constructed model to the initial data, the following statistical
    characteristics were analyzed: the average error, the average error modulus, the
    root mean square error, the correlation coefficient, and the Kling-Gupta complex
    efficiency.<br> The first result of calculations of sandy soil temperature simulations
    recorded a large difference from field measurements. The error could be associated
    with an overestimated amount of incoming precipitation in winter. The developers
    corrected the work of the model, rewrote the code.<br> The results of the second
    experiment (after correcting the model) on average for the year showed a decrease
    in the average calculation error (from 2 to 1.4), the error modulus (from 10.1
    to 4.2), the root mean square error (from 11.1 to 4, 9) and an increase in the
    correlation coefficient (from 0.3 to 0.7). The KGE coefficient on average for
    the year changed from -1.4 to -0.2. The most significant improvement in the simulation
    result is in the winter season at all depths.'
