  title: An Experimental Study on Stabilisation of Loose Soil by Using Sisal Fiber
  abstract: 'Soil Properties which creates a crucial impact on construction activities
    due to the rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization. Especially in expansive
    soils are creating worldwide problematic soil these having large volumetric change
    behavior when it undergoes a change in the moisture content. Among those, black
    cotton soil are one type of expansive soils and they show high swelling and shrinkage
    behavior owing to fluctuating water content. In India, black cotton soil covers
    as high as 20 of the total land area and majorly in central and south India. If
    it should be used as foundation material, Improvement of soil need to be done
    by adopting various techniques like soil stabilization, reinforcement etc. Usage
    of locally available admixtures is effective in terms of easy adaptability and
    economy.The main objective of this study is to assess the possibility of using
    sisal fiber as a stabilizing agent and to understand the effectiveness of sisal
    fibers in controlling several properties of black cotton soil under controlled
    laboratory conditions. To achieve this goal several experimental studies like
    optimum moisture content, compressive strengths tests UCS , CBR, etc., were carried
    out with the addition of different percentages of sisal in black cotton soil sample
    as trial and error process. In the present study, the soil samples prepared with
    the addition of sisal fibers by 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and 1 the average length of
    sisal fiber is going to use in this study is approximately 10 15mm. At first,
    Optimum Moisture Content OMC was determined through the proctor test. At those
    OMC, several tests like CBR, UCS were conducted. CBR test was carried in both
    Unsoaked and soaked condition and maximum values were obtained where 0.75 sisal
    fiber was added. K. Rupa Narayana Reddy | P. Praveen Kumar "An Experimental Study
