  title: Determination of Some Heavy Metals and Physicochemical Parameters of Soil,
    Vegetable and Some Fruits Grown in Mgbuodohia, Rumuolumeni, Port Harcourt
  abstract: "Abstract Heavy metals concentration were determined in soil, fruits and\
    \ vegetable samples collected from cultivated farmlands in Mgbuodohia, Rumuolumeni.\
    \ The samples were prepared, and analyzed for heavy metals using Atomic Absorption\
    \ Spectrophotometer (AAS). The physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical\
    \ conductivity, salinity, total organic carbon (TOC), total organic matter (TOM),nitrogen\
    \ content and particle size of the soil samples were determined using standard\
    \ methods. The results showed that heavy metals concentrations in soil samples\
    \ around pawpaw, pineapple, coconut fruits and okra had the following ranged;\
    \ Pb (BDL-0.89) mg/Kg, Cd (0.01-1.00) mg/Kg, Cr (0.32-4.02) mg/Kg, Fe (0.24-4.60)\
    \ mg/Kg, Cu (0.74-2.66) mg/Kg, Zn (0.34-0.636) mg/Kg. In the fruits; Pb (BDL-0.06)\
    \ mg/Kg, Cr (BDL-3.57) mg/Kg, Fe (1.84- 6.82) mg/Kg, Cu (0.15.82) mg/Kg, Zn (0.40-0.83)\
    \ mg/Kg, and Cd (BDL-0.24) mg/Kg. The physico-chemical properties had the following\
    \ ranged; pH(6.2-6.6), electrical conductivity (2.9-4.6) \xB5s/cm, sanility (9.0-24)\
    \ mg/Kg, moisture (14.69-21.40) %, TOC (1.71-2.63) %, Total nitrogen (0.08-0.11)\
    \ %, TOM (2.94-4.04) %, sand (67-73) %, silt (11-12) % and clay (15-22) %.\_ The\
    \ results revealed that zinc had the highest transfer factor (TP) in the fruit\
    \ samples examined, while chromium and lead had the lowest. The results revealed\
    \ that anthropogenic activities within the vicinity of Mgbu-odohia community may\
    \ have influenced the high concentrations of chromium and cadmium in the samples.\
    \ The concentration of cadmium and chromium were above, while others were below\
    \ the permissible limit set for heavy metals in food by World Health Organisation\
    \ (WHO), and Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)."
