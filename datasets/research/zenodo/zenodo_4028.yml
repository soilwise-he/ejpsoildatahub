  title: Effect of Tillage Methods on Soil Properties, Growth and Yield of Maize (Zea
    mays L.) in Makurdi, Nigeria
  abstract: 'The research was conducted at the Teaching and Research Farm of the University
    of Agriculture Makurdi to evaluate the effect of five (5) tillage methods on soil
    properties, growth and yield of maize. The experimental design consisted of five
    (5) treatments that were replicated three times and laid out in a Randomized Complete
    Block Design (RCBD). These treatments are: Surface tillage (T1), ridges (T2),
    zero tillage (T3), heaps (T4) and tied ridges (T5). Each plot measured 5 m x 5
    m with spacing of 1 m between replicates and 0.5 m between plots in the same replicate
    thus giving a total plot size of 17 m x 27 m (459 m2). A composite soil sample
    was obtained from a plough layer (0-15 cm) at the beginning and at the end of
    the experiment according to the treatments and analyzed for soil properties in
    the Advanced Soil Science Laboratory, University of Agriculture Makurdi. Data
    collected for the growth and yield parameters of maize were subjected to the Analysis
    of Variance (ANOVA) after which significant means were separated using Least Significant
    Difference (LSD) at P&lt;0.05. The results of the study showed that the various
    tillage methods had no significant effect on the soil properties. However, there
    was significant effect on some of the growth parameters as well as the yield of
    maize. It can be concluded that all the tillage methods be adopted or utilized
    for maize production in Makurdi sub-humid region and also the surface tillage
    should be utilized the most since it gave the highest grain yield of maize.'
