  title: Analysis of Soil pH and Organic Matter in Central and Southern Zones of Plateau
    State
  abstract: "This study assessed soil pH and organic matter<br> in central and southern\
    \ zones of Plateau state. Stratified<br> random sampling method was adopted for\
    \ collecting the<br> soil samples, and a total of 736 samples covering the total<br>\
    \ area were collected. The physico-chemical characteristics<br> of the soil samples\
    \ were analyzed at the laboratory of the<br> Centre for Dry Land Agriculture (CDA)\
    \ located within<br> Bayero University Kano (BUK) in Nigeria. The soil pH<br>\
    \ and organic matter values for the collected soil samples<br> were determined\
    \ by Potentiometric 1:2 pH-m and<br> Walkely and Black methods respectively. The\
    \ values of<br> the parameters were entered in attribute table and linked<br>\
    \ with the ArcGIS 10.8 to develop a relational database.The investigation involved\
    \ employing the Inverse<br> Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method to create<br>\
    \ a spatial representation of soil pH and organic matter<br> distribution.The<br>\
    \ investigation also involved conducting Pearson's product<br> moment correlation\
    \ analysis between soil pH and organic matter across multiple soil sample locations,\
    \ utilizing<br> SPSS version 25, a statistical software package. The result<br>\
    \ obtained for the correlation co-efficient \u03B3 is \u20130.071 and<br> the\
    \ p-value is 0.055 using 0.01 level of significance showed<br> that; the association\
    \ or relationship between soil pH and<br> organic matter is weak, since 0.071\
    \ is less than 0.3, they<br> have a negative relationship, which means that they\
    \ move<br> in an opposite direction, and that an increase in soil<br> organic\
    \ matter leads to a decrease in soil pH and vice<br> versa; the association between\
    \ the two variables (soil pH<br> and organic matter) is insignificant, since the\
    \ p-value<br> 0.055 is greater than the level of significance + 0.01. The<br>\
    \ study recommends that farmers should be discouraged<br> from the slash and burn\
    \ practice which does not allow for<br> the decomposition of organic material\
    \ to enhance the<br> organic matter content of the soil."
