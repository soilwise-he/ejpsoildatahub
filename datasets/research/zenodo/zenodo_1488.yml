  title: The bacterial evaluation of maize root (Zea mays L.) in oil-polluted soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) is one of the most important
    environmental challenges. Phytoremediation of oil-polluted soil depends on microorganisms
    of the rhizosphere. This study attempts to evaluate the microbial impact of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Zea&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;mays&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;rhizosphere
    during a 60 day period using three different treatments: control soil, oil-polluted
    soil and oil-polluted soil including fertilizer (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;No&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,
    K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Then, the rhizosphere bacteria
    were identified. The results showed that CFU per gram of control soil was higher
    than other treated soils, an indication of oil stress on microbial population.
    In addition, more bacterial diversity was observed in soils and different bacteria
    were isolated from the soils. Finally, the most resistant bacteria to the oil
    pollution were assayed. The assay of isolates indicated that all of those separated
    from the oil-polluted soil have the ability to produce biosurfactant in different
    quantities. Further investigation must be carried out to optimize the degradation
    of oil by these isolates.&lt;/p&gt;'
