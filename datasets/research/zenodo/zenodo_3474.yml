  title: Effect Of Ionic Strength On Mercury Adsorption On Contaminated Soil
  abstract: 'Mercury adsorption on soil was investigated at

    different ionic strengths using Ca(NO3)2 as a background electrolyte.

    Results fitted the Langmuir equation and the adsorption isotherms

    reached a plateau at higher equilibrium concentrations. Increasing

    ionic strength decreased the sorption of mercury, due to the

    competition of Ca ions for the sorption sites in the soils. The

    influence of ionic strength was related to the mechanisms of heavy

    metal sorption by the soil. These results can be of practical

    importance both in the agriculture and contaminated soils since the

    solubility of mercury in soils are strictly dependent on the adsorption

    and release process.'
