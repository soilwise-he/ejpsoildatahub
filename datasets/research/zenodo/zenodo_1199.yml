  title: Environmental Impact of Mpape Dumpsite Solid Waste on Soil Quality, Abuja
    Nigeria
  abstract: This study examined the impact of dumpsite on soil and plant quality in
    Mpape, Abuja FCT. The study employed both transect and quadrant techniques in
    collecting soil and plant samples. The soil samples were taken in both rainy and
    dry season for three months each at the depth of 0-30cm using soil auger. A total
    of forty-eight soil sample and thirty- two plant samples were collected, totaling
    eighty samples in and around Mpape Dumpsite and taken to Abuja Environmental Protection
    Board (AEPB) laboratory in Asokoro Abuja and analyzed to determine the level of
    heavy metals which included lead, mercury, iron, cadmium, silver and copper, using
    standard measurements. The result from the laboratory analysis were subjected
    to statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance and paired sample t-test to
    determine the mean difference between the months, seasons and the mean difference
    between the heavy metals concentration and FEPA Limits. From the analysis there
    was high concentration of heavy meals in Mpape Dumpsite in both raining and dry
    season. Also, a substantial concentration of the heavy metal is found in the plant
    samples responsible for the retardation in growth in fruits from the selected
    plants analyzed.
