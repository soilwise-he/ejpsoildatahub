  title: Effect of Storage and Poultry Manure Dosage on Soil Nitrate (NO3-) and Ammonium
    (NH4+) Availability, N-Uptake, and Yield of Head Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa, L.)
    Grown on Typic Calciaquolls
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>The objective\
    \ of this experiment was to investigate the effect of storage and poultry manure\
    \ dosage on soil nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>)\
    \ availability, N-uptake, and yield of Head lettuce (Lactuca sativa, L.) grown\
    \ on Typic Calciaquoll. Data obtained from the experiment of seven treatments\
    \ with four replications were subjected to Randomized Block Design. The observation\
    \ conducted in three times i.e. 4 Week After Plant (WAP), 6 WAP, and 8 WAP. The\
    \ treatments were: (1) without poultry manure (control), (2) dry poultry manure\
    \ (DPM) with 12,5 g dosage, (3) DPM with 25 g dosage, (4) DPM with 37,5 g dosage,\
    \ (5) fresh poultry manure (FPM) with 12,5 g dosage, (6) FPM with 25 g dosage,\
    \ (7) FPM with 37,5 g dosage. The results of experiment showed that there were\
    \ significantly effects of storage and poultry manure dosage on soil nitrate and\
    \ ammonium, N-uptake, and yield of head lettuce. The treatment combination of\
    \ DPM 37,5 g showed the highest value on soil nitrate and ammonium in 4 WAP, N-uptake\
    \ in 6 and 8 WAP, and the yield of head lettuce in 6 and 8 WAP. The treatment\
    \ combination of FPM 37,5 g showed the highest value on soil nitrate and ammonium\
    \ in 6 and 8 WAP, N-uptake in 4 WAP, and the yield of Head lettuce in 4 WAP. Generally,\
    \ it concluded that the dry poultry manure (DPM) had the better effects than the\
    \ fresh poultry manure (FPM) on yield of head lettuce</em><em>.</em>"
