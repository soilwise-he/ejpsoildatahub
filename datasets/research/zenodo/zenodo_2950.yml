  title: The influence of soil and climatic conditions on the manifestation of economically
    valuable traits in different varieties of Helianthus annuus L.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;To carry out a comprehensive
    study and evaluation of new varieties of the common sunflower (&lt;em&gt;Helianthus
    annuus&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;L.) according to the main economically valuable traits,
    in particular yield, disease resistance, oil and protein content.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The following methods were
    used: field, laboratory, comparison and mathematical statistics. The qualification
    examination of sunflower varieties on suita&shy;bility for distribution in Ukraine
    (SVD) was carried out in the Steppe and Forest-Steppe soil-climatic zones. In
    the research process, the &ldquo;Methodology for the qualification examination
    of plant varieties on suitability for distribution in Ukraine (general part)&rdquo;
    and the &ldquo;Methodology for the examination of technical and fodder plant varieties
    on suitability for distribution in Ukraine&rdquo; were used.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The varietal potential of
    the common sunflower in terms of yield, protein and oil content and hulliness
    was analysed. At the same time, economically valuable traits of new varieties
    (&lsquo;MAS 804G&rsquo;, &lsquo;LG58390&rsquo;, &lsquo;LG50550 CLP&rsquo;, &lsquo;SY
    THEOS&rsquo;, &lsquo;LG50549 SX&rsquo;, &lsquo;LG58630&rsquo;, &lsquo;P64LL164&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;P64LL455&rsquo;), included in the State Register of Plant Varieties Suitable
    for Distribution in Ukraine, were evaluated. In all years of testing, the yield
    in the Forest-Steppe zone was higher than in the Steppe (&lsquo;MAS 804G&rsquo;
    &ndash; by 49%, &lsquo;LG50550 CLP&rsquo; &ndash; by 38%, &lsquo;SY THEOS&rsquo;
    &ndash; by 28.9%, &lsquo;LG50549 SX&rsquo; &ndash; by 21.9%, &lsquo;LG58630&rsquo;
    &ndash; 19.5%, &lsquo;P64LL455&rsquo; &ndash; 12.6%, &lsquo;P64LL164&rsquo; &ndash;
    10.3%) and the highest values were characterised for the varieties &lsquo;LG50550
    CLP&rsquo; (2.58&ndash;4.54 t/ha) and &lsquo;MAS 804G&rsquo; (2.79&ndash;4.26
    t/ha). With regard to quality indicators, in particular the oil content in seeds,
    &lsquo;P64LL164&rsquo; and &lsquo;SY THEOS&rsquo; were dominant, while the protein
    content was 17.7&ndash;17.5% in &lsquo;LG58630&rsquo; and 16.7&ndash;17.1% in
    &lsquo;LG58390&rsquo;.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;According
    to the results of the qualification examination on the suitability of the variety
    for distribution, the investigated varieties are recommended for cultivation in
    the Steppe and Forest-Steppe zones. The varieties with the highest oil content
    in seeds were identified as &lsquo;SY THEOS&rsquo; (Steppe &ndash; 51.4%, Forest-Steppe
    &ndash; 51.6%) and &lsquo;P64LL164&rsquo; (Steppe &ndash; 50.9%, Forest-Steppe
    &ndash; 52.1%). The highest protein accumulation was observed in variety &lsquo;LG5863&rsquo;
    (Steppe &ndash; 17.7%, Forest-Step&shy;pe &ndash; 17.5%).&lt;/p&gt;'
