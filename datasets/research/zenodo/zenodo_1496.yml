  title: Retrieval and Analysis of ASCAT and ISMN Data for Soil Moisture Estimation
    DMP
  abstract: This DMP outlines a project focused on retrieving and analyzing satellite-based
    ASCAT data and in-situ ISMN data for soil moisture estimation. By leveraging the
    H-SAF ASCAT SM CDR and ISMN data, the project explores the spatiotemporal dynamics
    of soil moisture and includes the calculation of Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD).
    Through the analysis of these datasets, the project aims to enhance our understanding
    of soil moisture dynamics and their implications for various applications such
    as agriculture, hydrology, and climate modeling. Following the Science Europe
    guidance and utilizing the TU Wien DMP Tool layout, the project ensures robust
    data management practices for reproducibility and facilitates the sharing and
    reuse of its findings.
