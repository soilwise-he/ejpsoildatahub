  title: Determinants Of Farmers' Decision On Soil Fertility Management Options For
    Maize Production In Southern Ethiopia
  abstract: "In Ethiopia, food insecurity has always been a burning problem. The gap\
    \ between demand for and supply of food can be minimized through protecting and\
    \ managing soil fertility and thereby increasing productivity of crops. This study\
    \ was conducted in major maize growing areas of southern Ethiopia. The objectives\
    \ of the study were to assess soil fertility management options available to smallholder\
    \ farmers and identify the factors that affect their decision making to apply\
    \ a given alternative in maize crop. The study was based on the cross sectional\
    \ data obtained from a random sample of 385 smallholder farmers. A multinomial\
    \ logit model was employed to identify socioeconomic, institutional and environmental\
    \ factors determining farmers\u2019 decision regarding the choice of a particular\
    \ soil fertility management option. The result indicated that size of farm, access\
    \ to credit, availability of extension services and training pertaining to soil\
    \ fertility management were important factors affecting the decision to use a\
    \ particular soil fertility management practice."
