  title: Soil Moisture Conservation in Dry Land Agriculture
  abstract: "In the current agricultural environment, the emphasis is on maximizing\
    \ the water productivity within the land use in order to feed the growing population\
    \ soil moisture conservation is a key component of raising water productivity.\
    \ the preservation of soil moisture particularly in rainfed and dry land agriculture\
    \ is a crucial component to prevent moisture deficiency in soil. Although the\
    \ rainfall in arid and semi-arid areas is sufficient for crop growth, dry spells\
    \ with unusual rainfall distribution during the crop\u2019s critical growth stages\
    \ can reduce the yield by 50% to 60%. Therefore, some efficient soil moisture\
    \ conservation techniques like mulching, deep tillage, compartmental bunding,\
    \ and basin listing are to be adopted for successful crop production in order\
    \ to prevent yield loss and maintain crop stands with the maximum yield. These\
    \ methods for conserving soil moisture can also enhance soil qualities and lessen\
    \ soil erosion and degradation."
