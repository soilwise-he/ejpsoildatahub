  title: Main Factors Determining the Scale-Up Effectiveness of Mycoremediation for
    the Decontamination of Aliphatic Hydrocarbons in Soil
  abstract: '&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Soil contamination constitutes a significant threat to the health of
    soil ecosystems in terms of complexity, toxicity, and recalcitrance. Among all
    contaminants, aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons (APH) are of particular concern
    due to their abundance and persistence in the environment and the need of remediation
    technologies to ensure their removal in an environmentally, socially, and economically
    sustainable way. Soil remediation technologies presently available on the market
    to tackle soil contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) include landfilling,
    physical treatments (e.g., thermal desorption), chemical treatments (e.g., oxidation),
    and conventional bioremediation. The first two solutions are costly and energy-intensive
    approaches. Conversely, bioremediation of on-site excavated soil arranged in biopiles
    is a more sustainable procedure. Biopiles are engineered heaps able to stimulate
    microbial activity and enhance biodegradation, thus ensuring the removal of organic
    pollutants. This soil remediation technology is currently the most environmentally
    friendly solution available on the market, as it is less energy-intensive and
    has no detrimental impact on biological soil functions. However, its major limitation
    is its low removal efficiency, especially for long-chain hydrocarbons (LCH), compared
    to thermal desorption. Nevertheless, the use of fungi for remediation of environmental
    contaminants retains the benefits of bioremediation treatments, including low
    economic, social, and environmental costs, while attaining removal efficiencies
    similar to thermal desorption. Mycoremediation is a widely studied technology
    at lab scale, but there are few experiences at pilot scale. Several factors may
    reduce the overall efficiency of on-site mycoremediation biopiles (mycopiles),
    and the efficiency detected in the bench scale. These factors include the bioavailability
    of hydrocarbons, the selection of fungal species and bulking agents and their
    application rate, the interaction between the inoculated fungi and the indigenous
    microbiota, soil properties and nutrients, and other environmental factors (e.g.,
    humidity, oxygen, and temperature). The identification of these factors at an
    early stage of biotreatability experiments would allow the application of this
    on-site technology to be refined and fine-tuned. This review brings together all
    mycoremediation work applied to aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons (APH) and identifies
    the key factors in making mycoremediation effective. It also includes technological
    advances that reduce the effect of these factors, such as the structure of mycopiles,
    the application of surfactants, and the control of environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
