  title: 'Long-term wastewater irrigation of vegetables in real agricultural systems:
    Concentration of pharmaceuticals in soil, uptake and bioaccumulation in tomato
    fruits and human health risk assessment'
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Wastewater (WW) reuse for vegetable crops irrigation is regularly applied
    worldwide. Such a practice has been found to allow the uptake of pharmaceutical
    active compounds (PhACs) by plants and their subsequent entrance to the food web,
    representing an important alternative pathway for the exposure of humans to PhACs,
    with potential health implications. Herein we report the impacts of the long-term
    (three consecutive years) WW irrigation of a tomato crop with two differently
    treated effluents under real agricultural conditions, on (1) the soil concentration
    of selected PhACs (i.e. diclofenac, DCF; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; trimethoprim,
    TMP), (2) the bioaccumulation of these PhACs in tomato fruits, and (3) the human
    risks associated with the consumption of WW-irrigated fruits. Results revealed
    that the concentration of the studied PhACs in both the soil and tomato fruits
    varied depending on the qualitative characteristics of the treated effluent applied
    and the duration of WW irrigation. The PhAC with the highest soil concentration
    throughout the studied period was SMX (0.98 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), followed
    by TMP (0.62 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and DCF (0.35 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).
    DCF was not found in tomato fruits harvested from WW-irrigated plants during the
    first year of the study. However, DCF displayed the highest fruit concentration
    (11.63 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) throughout the study (as a result of prolonged
    WW irrigation), followed by SMX (5.26 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and TMP
    (3.40 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). The calculated fruit bioconcentration factors
    (BCF&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) were extremely high for DCF in the 2nd (108) and
    3rd year (132) of the experimental period, with the respective values for SMX
    (0.5e5.4) and TMP (0.2e6.4) being significantly lower. The estimated threshold
    of toxicity concern (TTC) and hazard quotients (HQ) values revealed that the consumption
    of fruits harvested from tomato plants irrigated for long period with the WW applied
    for irrigation under field conditions in this study represent a&lt;em&gt; de minimis&lt;/em&gt;
    risk to human health. However, more studies need to be performed in order to obtain
    more solid information on the safety of WW reuse for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;'

    Institute, especially Mr. Kyriakos Konstantinou and Mr. Apostolos Petros, who
    have been involved in the study by maintaining the field culture of tomato plants
    and for their excellent technical assistance. This study was supported by the
    Cyprus Agricultural Research Institute Internal Grant to Anastasis Christou (ARI
    1303207/5.6). This research collaboration has been stimulated by COST - European
    Cooperation in Science and Technology, to the COST Action ES1403: New and emerging
    challenges and opportunities in wastewater reuse (NEREUS).'
