  title: Prediction of CBR Value of Stabilized Black Cotton Soil use for Road Construction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Black cotton soils of India are categorized as expansive soil
    due to Montmorrilonite mineral. Replacement of expansive soil with non expansive
    material, then transport longer distance causes environmental degradation and
    uneconomical Stabilization of clay soil is more effective and eco-friendly option
    when the soil is used for construction purpose. Stabilization is the process of
    improving the properties of soil by changing its gradation. Expansive soil is
    with varies additive, makes an improvement of connections between granules and
    reduces the expansibility and contractility of soil Californiaa Bearing Ratio
    (CBR) is a measure of resistance of a material to penetration of standard plunger
    under controlled density and moisture conditions. Stronger the subgrade lesser
    the thickness of road pavement layers, and hence reduction cost of project. In
    this work attempt has been made to understand to estimate the effect of stabilizer
    on liquid, plastic limit Maximum dry density and optimum moisture content properties
    of black cotton soil, in order to determine the suitability of stabilizer in the
    treatment of black cotton soil for sub grade stabilization in road construction.
    Main objective of the present study was to develop regression based model for
    estimating CBR, considering other properties of a soil so that developed models
    were used to predict the CBR from other properties. It has been observed from
    lab test stabilizer alter the properties of soil by reduce the plasticity characterstics
    and imprve load carrying capacity. Rrgression analyis shows that good aggrement
    with experimation results.&lt;/p&gt;'
