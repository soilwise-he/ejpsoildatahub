  title: A CASE STUDY ON PHYSICO-CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUND WATER AND SOIL
    SAMPLES OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE DUMP YARD
  abstract: "ABSTRACT \n\nThe pace urbanisation in India has been rapidly increasing,\
    \ with about 30% of the total population already living in urban areas. Studies\
    \ predict that, by 2025 AD, over 55% of India\u2019s population will be urban\
    \ and there will be over 50 cities with population excess of one million. Urbanization,\
    \ along with increased industrialisation and motorization, has severely damaged\
    \ urban environment and health of people. To minimize these ill effects, it is\
    \ necessary to have accurate, timely, reliable information and performance indicators\
    \ that can indicate the status of health and environment in urban areas, which\
    \ can be used to take corrective and preventive measures to improve the quality\
    \ of urban life.The distinctive character of urbanization is high density of population,\
    \ high-energy consumption and huge generation of high quality wastes and effluents\
    \ from both industries and domestic environment. The splendid achievements in\
    \ the field of science and technology made triumphant progress in the urbanisation.\
    \ According to ministry of urban affairs, government of India estimated 0.5 kg\
    \ (app.) of waster generated per person per day.\n\nThe problem of municipal solid\
    \ waste management has acquired alarming dimensions in our country especially\
    \ over the last decade. Before that, waste management was hardly considered as\
    \ an issue of concern as the wastes could be easily disposed off in an environmentally\
    \ safe manner within the generation premises. However, with the passage of time,\
    \ due to changing life styles of people coupled with urbanization and industrialisation\
    \ the waste characteristics have altered making them a little tricky to be managed.In\
    \ this paper an attempt has been made to highlight the physico-chemical characteristics\
    \ of ground water and soil samples around municipal dump yard and to assess whether\
    \ the water is suitable for drinking purpose.\n\nKeywords: Physicochemical, Ground\
    \ water, Solid Waste Dump Yard"
