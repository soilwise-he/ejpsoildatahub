  title: An Experimental Study on Shear Strength of Soil Sub Grade using Cement as
    Stabilizing Agent
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil stabilization is the process of altering some soil properties
    by different methods, mechanical or chemical in order to produce an improved soil
    material which has all the desired engineering properties. Soils are generally
    stabilized to increase their strength and durability or to prevent erosion and
    dust formation in soils. The main aim is the creation of a soil material or system
    that will hold under the design use conditions and for the designed life of the
    engineering project. The properties of soil vary a great deal at different places
    or in certain cases even at one place the success of soil stabilization depends
    on soil testing. Various methods are employed to stabilize soil and the method
    should be verified in the lab with the soil material before applying it on the
    field.The prime objective of soil stabilization is to improve the California Bearing
    Ratio of in situ soils by 4 to 6 times. The other prime objective of soil stabilization
    is to improve on site materials to create a solid and strong sub base and base
    courses. In certain regions of the world, typically developing countries and now
    more frequently in developed countries, soil stabilization stabilization is to
    improve on site materials to create a solid and strong sub base and base courses.
    In certain regions of the world, typically developing countries and now more frequently
    in developed countries, soil stabilization is being used to construct the entire
    road. In the past, soil stabilization was done by utilizing the binding properties
    of clay soils, cement based products such as soil cement utilizing the rammed
    earth technique compaction and lime. Traditionally and widely accepted types of
    soil stabilization techniques use products such as bitumen emulsions which can
    be used as a binding agents for producing a road base. However, bitumen is not
    environmentally friendly and becomes brittle when it dries out. Portland cement
    has been used as an alternative to soil stabilization. However, this can often
    be expensive and is not a very good green alternative. The prime objective of
    Soil Stabilization is to improve the California Bearing Ratio of in situ soils
    by 4 to 6 times. The other prime objective of soil stabilization is to improve
    on site materials to create a solid and strong sub base and base courses. In certain
    regions of the world, typically developing countries and now more frequently in
    developed countries, soil stabilization is being used to construct the entire
    road. Originally, soil stabilization was done by utilizing the binding properties
    of clay soils, cement based products such as soil cement, and or utilizing the
    rammed earth technique soil compaction and lime. Some of the renewable technologies
    are enzymes, surfactants, biopolymers, synthetic polymers, co polymer based products,
    cross linking styrene acrylic polymers, tree resins, ionic stabilizers, fiber
    reinforcement, calcium chloride, calcite, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride
    and more. Some of these new stabilizing techniques create hydrophobic surfaces
    and mass that prevent road failure from water penetration or heavy frosts by inhibiting
    the ingress of water into the treated layer. Farkhanda Fayaz | Mohd Shoeb Alam
