  title: Using the Reserves of Macro and Microelements from the Soil by Means of Mycorrhizae
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Farmers and Agricultural Experts are Under Pressure to Increase Crop
    Yield Due to the Rising Demand for Food and the Shrinking Amount of Arable Land.
    To Increase Agricultural Output, This Has Resulted in an Overuse of Chemical Pesticides
    and Fertilizers. The Symbiotic Relationship between Rooted Plants and Arbuscular
    Mycorrhiza (Am) is one of the Earliest Known Symbiotic Relationships in Nature.
    About 80% of the Species of Terrestrial Plants are colonized by A Fungus Called
    Arbuscular Mycorrhiza. In Exchange For Carbon Sources, These Plants Take Nutrients
    from the Earth and Transfer Them to Hosts Plants. Indeed, Am Fungi Play a Significant
    Role in Sustainable Agriculture by Protecting Plants From Biotic and Abiotic Stressors.
    Due to the Negative Effects of Chemical-Based Fertilizers, the Am Fungi are Crucial
    for Biofertilizers Because of These Characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;'
