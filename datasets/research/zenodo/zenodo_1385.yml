  title: Polychlorinated biphenyls remediation in soil using moringa seeds and coconut
    shell based adsorbents
  abstract: 'The occurrence and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in
    soil from Jos, Plateau State Nigeria was carried out. The polychlorinated biphenyls
    in the soil was extracted with hexane-acetone mixture (1:1) in ultrasonic bath
    and cleaned with column chromatography packed with silica gel. The polychlorinated
    biphenyls were quantified using Agilent 6975 Gas chromatography Mass Spectrophotometer
    and the concentrations were found as: PCB18 (0.71), PCB20 (0.37), PCB28 (0.38),
    PCB29 (0.38), PCB44 (0.42), PCB52 (0.66), PCB101 (0.61), PCB105 (0.17), PCB137
    (0.64), PCB142 (0.33), PCB153 (0.42), PCB170 (0.13) and PCB180 (0.21) mg/kg. After
    remediation of PCB with moringa seeds, the concentration were as; PCB20 (0.28),
    PCB28 (0.28), PCB29 (0.28), PCB52 (0.30), PCB101 (0.18) and PCB143 (0.91), while
    the others removed completely. The moringa seeds powder removed the PCBs completely
    except PCB105. The activated carbon (AC) prepared moringa seeds reduced the concentrations
    of BCBs as; PCB 18 (0.04), PCB 20 (0.011), PCB 28 (0.019), PCB 29 (0.019), PCB
    44 (0.021), PCB 52 (0.33), PCB 101 (0.031), PCB137 (0.032), PCB 142 (0.017), PCB
    153 (0.021), PCB 170 (0.007) and PCB 180 (0.011) mg/kg. The result suggests that
    moringa seed powder could possibly be served as an excellent means of remediation
    for polychlorinated biphenyls in contaminated soil.'
