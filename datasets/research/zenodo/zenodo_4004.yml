  title: Kinetic Modeling for Removal of Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cr Ions from Petrochemical
    Effluent using Termite Soil
  abstract: 'Increase in concentration of heavy metals ions in our water bodies is
    of great concern. This work is aimed at providing an environmental and cost effective
    adsorbent for the removal of Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd from petrochemical effluent. Termite
    soil was pretreated and used for the sorption process and process parameters such
    as contact time and particle size of the adsorbent was varied. Optimum contact
    time of 60 minutes was obtained for Pb and Cd ions while 40 minutes was obtained
    for Ni and Cr ions for all particle sizes of adsorbent used. Initial reaction
    rate H(mg/g.min) was of the order for the different particle sized adsorbent,
    75mm: Pb&gt;Cd&gt;Cr&gt;Ni, 212mm: Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Cr&gt;Ni and 300mm: Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Ni&gt;Cr.
    Pseudo first order kinetics had less difference between experimental and theoretical
    adsorption capacity (Qa - Qb) with R2 close to that obtained for Pseudo-second
    order kinetics. Hence it is considered as the kinetic order for the adsorption
    process. Percentage of the studied ions removed from the wastewater solution shows
    the suitability of the adsorbent sequestering of heavy metal ions from industrial
    wastewater.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V5201602950 AND DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18483/ijSci.950'
