  title: Assessment of Pier Foundations for Onshore Wind Turbines in Non-cohesive
    Soil
  abstract: In non-cohesive soil, onshore wind turbines are often found on shallow
    foundations with a circular or octagonal shape. For the current generation of
    wind turbines, shallow foundations with very large breadths are required. The
    foundation support costs thus represent a considerable portion of the total construction
    costs. Therefore, an economic optimization of the type of foundation is highly
    desirable. A conceivable alternative foundation type would be a pier foundation,
    which combines the load transfer over the foundation area at the pier base with
    the transfer of horizontal loads over the shaft surface of the pier. The present
    study aims to evaluate the load-bearing behavior of a pier foundation based on
    comprehensive parametric studies. Thereby, three-dimensional numerical simulations
    of both pier and shallow foundations are developed. The evaluation of the results
    focuses on the rotational stiffnesses of the proposed soil-foundation systems.
    In the design, the initial rotational stiffness is decisive for consideration
    of natural frequencies, whereas the rotational secant stiffness for a maximum
    load is decisive for serviceability considerations. A systematic analysis of the
    results at different load levels shows that the application of the typical pier
    foundation is presumably limited to relatively small onshore wind turbines.
