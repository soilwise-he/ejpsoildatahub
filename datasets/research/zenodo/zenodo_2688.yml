  title: Soil Moisture Conservation through Crop Diversification and Related Ecosystem
    Services in a Blown-Sand Area with High Drought Hazard
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil moisture reserves are a key factor in maintaining soil
    fertility and all other related&lt;br&gt;ecosystem services (including carbon
    sequestration, soil biodiversity, and soil erosion control). In&lt;br&gt;semiarid
    blown-sand areas under aridification, water preservation is a particularly crucial
    task&lt;br&gt;for agriculture. The international Diverfarming project (2017&ndash;2022),
    within the EU Horizon 2020&lt;br&gt;Program, focused on the impacts of crop diversification
    and low-input practices in all pedoclimatic&lt;br&gt;regions of Europe. In this
    three-year experiment conducted in the Pannonian region, the impact of&lt;br&gt;intercropping
    asparagus with different herbs on some provisioning and regulating ecosystem services&lt;br&gt;was
    evaluated in the Kiskuns&aacute;g sand regions. Relying on findings based on a
    range of measured&lt;br&gt;physical and chemical soil parameters and on crop yields
    and qualitative properties, advice was&lt;br&gt;formulated for farmers. The message
    drawn from the experiment is somewhat ambiguous. The local&lt;br&gt;farmers agree
    that crop diversification improves soil quality, but deny that it would directly
    influence&lt;br&gt;farm competitiveness, which primarily depends on cultivation
    costs (such as fertilization, plant&lt;br&gt;protection, and labour). Further
    analyses are needed to prove the long-term benefits of diversification&lt;br&gt;through
    enriching soil microbial life and through the possible reduction of fertilizer
    use, while water&lt;br&gt;demand is kept at a low level and the same crop-quality
    is ensured.&lt;/p&gt;'
