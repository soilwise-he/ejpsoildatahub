  title: EFFECT OF SOIL STRUCTURE INTERACTION ON RESPONSE REDUCTION FACTOR FOR PIER
    OF SKEW BRIDGE
  abstract: "Bridges are inevitable structures which plays an important role in the\
    \ development of the country. The bridge design should be strong, economical and\
    \ safe during earthquake. In the present study, pier of skew bridge is analyzed\
    \ using FEM based software MIDAS Civil. For the analysis of the pier, displacement\
    \ controlled nonlinear static pushover analysis method is used. The primary aim\
    \ of the study is to compare Response Reduction Factor with and without consideration\
    \ of soil structure interaction on pile foundation as per Applied Technology Council\
    \ (ATC \u2013 19). After comparison, it is observed that base shear has been decreased\
    \ up to 20% and time period increases up to 14% while considering soil structure\
    \ interaction."
