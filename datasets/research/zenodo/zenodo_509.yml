  title: Studies on Phosphate Solubilizing Microorganisms Isolated From Soil
  abstract: "In the present study phosphates solubilizing microbial (PSM) cultures\
    \ were isolated from the collected soil samples. Rhizospheric microflora such\
    \ as Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter\
    \ sp. were isolated as a phosphate solubilizing strains using selective agar media.\
    \ The isolated bacterial cultures were recognized by culture dependent method\
    \ and the fungal species were identified by morphological characters. The bacterial\
    \ isolates were incubated at 35\xB0C for 24-48 hrs in incubator while fungal cultures\
    \ were incubated at 35\xB0C for 48-72 hrs in incubator. The serial dilution as\
    \ 10-4, 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 were preferred for the isolation of PSM. On Pikovaskays\
    \ agar plate, the zone of clearance verified phosphate solubilization. The identified\
    \ strains may be useful in enhancing crop yield, preventing plant diseases, and\
    \ promoting growth."
