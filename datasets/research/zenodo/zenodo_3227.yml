  title: EFFECT OF WHEAT CROP RESIDUE INCORPORATION WITH THE SOIL AND NITROGEN FERTILIZER
    RATES ON PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.) VARIETY IN GIBE DISTRICT HADIYA ZONE,
    SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA.
  abstract: "Maize is an important cereal in human diets and animal feed, providing\
    \ adequate energy and protein. Even though many biotic and abiotic factors can\
    \ contribute to the big yield gaps, soil fertility depletion, and poor organic\
    \ and inorganic nutrient management are among the major factors contributing to\
    \ low productivity. Therefore, this research aims to determine the effect of wheat\
    \ crop residue incorporation with the soil and nitrogen fertilizer rates on the\
    \ productivity of maize variety in the study area. The study was conducted in\
    \ Gibe District, Hadiya Zone, Southern Nations Nationalities, and People Regional\
    \ State at farmers\u2019 fields during the main cropping season in 2022. The treatments\
    \ consisted of two factors, namely, four levels of nitrogen rates (75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>,\
    \ 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, 125 kg ha<sup>-1,</sup> and 150 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of\
    \ N in the form of urea) and five-level wheat residue application rates (control,\
    \ 2.5t/ha, 3t/ha, 3.5t/ha and 4t/ha). The experiment was laid out in randomized\
    \ complete block design (RCBD) in 4 x 5 factorial arrangements with three replications.\
    \ The analysis of variance showed that the maximum grain yield (4.863 t ha<sup>-1</sup>)\
    \ was obtained with the highest N rate (150 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>), which applied\
    \ 4 t ha<sup>-1</sup> of residue incorporation with the soil. While the least\
    \ value grain yield (2.877 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) was recorded in plots that received\
    \ (75 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) applied at 4 t ha<sup>-1</sup> of residue incorporation\
    \ with the soil. Like grain yield, the total biomass yield of maize also increased\
    \ linearly with an increase in nitrogen fertilizer rates. Thus, the results suggested\
    \ that using 150 kg N ha<sup>-1, </sup>which applied 4 t ha<sup>-1</sup> of residue\
    \ incorporation with the soil, increased the yield of maize in the study area."
