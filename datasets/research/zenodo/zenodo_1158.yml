  title: Analysis and Optimization of Hybrid Soil Properties for Gel Based Roof Tiles
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Our current 21st century has seen more drastic changes in terms
    of environmental conditions due to global warming, climate change and deforestation.
    This has shown a great rise in the global temperature throughout the world. Normally,
    the roof top of a building is provided with tiles to protect the structural components
    and to create a comfortable environment. The tiles can be made of materials like
    clay, concrete, fly ash, lime etc. Due to the prevailing environmental challenges,
    there is a need for the tiles to be made as with more energy efficient material
    that supports thermal insulation and cost effectiveness. Aerogel and hydrogel
    are the gel based product that are used in our current work to enhance the thermal
    insulation property of the tiles. Various tests such as water absorption test,
    wet and dry cycle test, bending strength test, thermal conductivity test, wear
    and tear test are carried out on the tile to quantify its characteristics. All
    the above shows better value than the normal commercial tile product.&lt;/p&gt;'
