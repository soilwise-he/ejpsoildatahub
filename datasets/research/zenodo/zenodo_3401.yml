  title: Soil-Cement Floor Produced With Alum Water Treatment Residues
  abstract: From a concern regarding the environmental impacts caused by the disposal
    of residues generated in Water Treatment Plants (WTP's), alternatives ways have
    been studied to use these residues as raw material for manufacture of building
    materials, avoiding their discharge on water streams, disposal on sanitary landfills
    or incineration. This paper aims to present the results of a research work, which
    is using WTR for replacing the soil content in the manufacturing of soil-cement
    floor with proportions of 0, 5, 10 and 15%. The samples tests showed a reduction
    mechanical strength in so far as has increased the amount of waste. The water
    absorption was below the maximum of 6% required by the standard. The application
    of WTR contributes to the reduction of the environmental damage in the water treatment
    industry.
