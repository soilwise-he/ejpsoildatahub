  title: Denoting the intensity of soil biochemical transition according to stand
    species composition
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to denote biochemical soil activity\
    \ in pure Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver fir, European larch, European beech\
    \ and oak stands as well as in mixed fir-pine, beech-pine and fir-beech forests\
    \ growing on a fertile fresh mixed deciduous site. The field work was carried\
    \ out in the following Forest Districts: Nowe Ramuki (Mazursko-Podlaska forest\
    \ region), P\u0142o\u0144sk, Jab\u0142onna, Brzeziny Siedlce, Gr&oacute;jec (Mazowiecko-Podlaska\
    \ forest region) and Skar\u017Cysko, Ostrowiec and Marcule (Ma\u0142opolska forest\
    \ region). In 2015&ndash;2017, sample plots were assigned and chemical as well\
    \ as soil enzyme activity measurements were made in each forest stand. Samples\
    \ were taken from the organic (O) and humus (A) layers and for both the acidity\
    \ (in 1M KCl), content of nitrogen, carbon, sum of exchangeable alkaline cations\
    \ and hydrolytic acidity were determined. The investigation of soil enzymes included\
    \ the measurements of urease, asparginase, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase\
    \ activity. Coniferous trees, especially fir, spruce or larch, and mixed fir-beech\
    \ and pine-beech stands were observed to have a very positive influence on the\
    \ biochemical soil properties. The highest activity of dehydrogenase was observed\
    \ in soils of spruce and mixed fir-beech stands, whereas it was lower in soils\
    \ of beech and pine stands, and the lowest in oak stands. Oak stands were furthermore\
    \ characterized by the lowest soil acidity, lowest concentration of alkaline cations,\
    \ the lowest nitrogen and carbon content as well as the smallest C/N ratio. In\
    \ overall, soil enzyme activity showed a significant correlation with chemical\
    \ soil parameters.&lt;/p&gt;"
