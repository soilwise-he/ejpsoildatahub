  title: Implement Draught and Power Requirement for Tillage operations in Gezira
    Soil (With Special Reference to Massad Area)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An experiment was conducted during the year 2011 at Massad Centre
    for Technology Transfer and Extension (latitude 14&deg;&nbsp;24&cent;N and longitude
    33&deg;&nbsp;29&cent;E) in Gazira Scheme-Sudan to study tractor power requirement
    for two implements commonly used for tillage operations in Gazira Scheme. The
    implements were a chisel plough as a primary tillage implement and an offset disc
    harrow for secondary tillage. Power requirements were studied under wet and dry
    soil conditions and for two depths of work for each implement (20-30cm, 5-10cm).&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Effect of implement draught on the performance of 2WD (120 hp) tractor
    was investigated in terms of wheel slip (%) under the field conditions of the
    experiment using different levels of wheel ballast.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Draught requirement for the chisel plough was found to be as a range
    between11 to 15 kN.&nbsp; And for disc harrowing the values ranged between 7 to
    10 kN. Maximum power required at a speed of 7 km/h was 29 kW (39 hp).&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Optimum performance (with 10 to 15% wheel slip) during chisel ploughing
    was achieved with water ballast at the rear wheels to 50% of the tyre volume and
    50 kg of cast iron weight on each rear wheel. During disc harrowing, optimum performance
    was achieved with 25% water ballast in the rear wheels with additional 100 kg
    of cast iron weight on the rear wheels.&lt;/p&gt;'
