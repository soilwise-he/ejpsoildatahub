  title: Soil Physical and Chemical Properties of Several Soil Order in Suboptimal
    Dryland of Aceh Besar District, Indonesia
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <br> The appropriate management of suboptimal\
    \ dryland expands potentially<br> agricultural areas because the soil properties\
    \ in such an area are very diverse in each<br> region and agroclimatic zone. A\
    \ field study and laboratory analysis have been carried<br> out to assess soil\
    \ chemical characteristics in several soil orders in suboptimal dryland of<br>\
    \ Aceh Besar District, Indonesia. There are five soil orders representing soil\
    \ types in the<br> areas, namely Inceptisol Blang Bintang, Andisol Saree, Mollisol\
    \ Krueng Raya, Ultisol<br> Jantho, and Oxisol Lembah Seulawah. Samples were taken\
    \ for each horizon layer from<br> the soil orders. Analyses of the soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties were done,<br> including texture, pH (in H2O and KCl),\
    \ organic C , total N, total P2O5 and K2O<br> contents, available P, exchangeable\
    \ base cations (Ca-, Mg-, K-, and Na-exch), potential<br> cation exchange capacity\
    \ (CEC), Al- and H-exch., base saturation (BS), and electrical<br> conductivity\
    \ (EC). The results showed that soil physical properties and chemical<br> characteristics\
    \ varied between soil orders, but soil fertility status in some soil orders was<br>\
    \ predominantly low. This low fertility status is indicated by acid soil reaction\
    \ (pH 5.25-<br> 6.48), low total C (&lt;10 g/kg), low total N (0.7\u20132.7 g/kg),\
    \ and low of bases saturation<br> (&lt;40%), so that these soils require the addition\
    \ of soil amendments and fertilizers. Soil<br> orders with low soil fertility\
    \ are Oxisols, Ultisols, and Inceptisols, while other soil orders<br> such as\
    \ Andisol and Mollisol are classified as medium soil fertility. The order of soil<br>\
    \ quality from the highest to lowest is: Mollisols = Andisols &gt; Ultisols =\
    \ Oxisols =<br> Inceptisols."
