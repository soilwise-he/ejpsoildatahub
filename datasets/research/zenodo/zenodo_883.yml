  title: 'INTEGRATED WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME: AN ULTIMATE TOOL FOR SOIL CONSERVATION'
  abstract: <em>Food production is increasing at a mere rate of 0.2 percent, which
    is not on par with the growth rate of the population in the country. To meet this
    demand, the best technological approaches have been adapted in terms of HYV seeds,
    fertilizers, pesticides, machines etc. Since agriculture sector is prone to diminishing
    returns to scale, further improvement in technology will not help in increasing
    the productivity levels. Thus, there is a need to explore, other possibilities
    of increasing the agricultural production and productivity. In this process, increase
    in cropping intensity, by utilizing the existing water resources is an important
    area to be explored. But extensive use of arable land has resulted in drastic
    soil erosion. This gets reflected in reduced agricultural productivity. Soil erosion
    is a widespread environmental problem that threatens human beings in the developing
    countries. Each year, 75 billion tons of soil is removed in the globe due to erosion
    with most of it from agricultural land. An average rate of soil erosion in Asia
    is more than 138 tonnes (ha. year). Proper environmental planning at different
    levels has been called for by watershed managers during the last 17 years with
    the introduction of KAWAD Project (2001) to integrate natural resources and human
    needs continually and effectively. Therefore, soil conservation is the need of
    the hour and a well-structuredintegrated watershed management programmes can play
    a vital role in soil conservation. </em>
