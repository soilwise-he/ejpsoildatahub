  title: Extraction and spectrophotometric determination of molybdenum(V) as its thiocyanate
    complex in industrial, environmental and soil samples
  abstract: "Department of Industrial Chemistry, Guru Nanak Khalsa College, Yamuna\
    \ Nagar-135 001, Haryana, India Department of Chemistry, Haryana Engineering College,\
    \ Jagadhari-135 003, Haryana, India <em>Manuscript received 26 February 2008,\
    \ revised 15 October 2008, accepted 12 November 2008</em> A simple and rapid extractive\
    \ spectrophotometric method for micro determination of molybdenum using thiocyanate\
    \ as a complexing agent has been worked out for industrial, environmental and\
    \ soil samples. The Mo<sup>v</sup>- thioqanate complex is extracted into 2,2'\
    \ -dipyridyl in chloroform. The vermilion colour of the extract is measured at\
    \ \u03BB<sub>max </sub>505 nm against a similarly prepared reagent blank. The\
    \ 1 : 4 (Mo : SCN) complex is found to be ~table for more than one hour in the\
    \ extract and obeys Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-11 \xB5g Mo ml<sup>-1</sup>.\
    \ The molar absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity of the proposed method are\
    \ found to be 1.24 x 10<sup>4</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ and 0.0075 \xB5g Mo cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. A large number of cations,\
    \ anions and complexing agents of major analytical importance such as Re<sup>vll</sup>,\
    \ Cr<sup>lll</sup>,<sup>VI</sup>, Cu<sup>ll</sup> , Zr<sup>lv</sup>, Mn<sup>ll</sup>\
    \ , Ni<sup>ll</sup>, Fc<sup>ll</sup>,<sup>lll</sup>, W<sup>vl</sup>, U<sup>vl</sup>,\
    \ V<sup>v</sup> and platinum metals, sulphate, chloride, fluoride, bicarbonate,\
    \ phosphate. tartrate and EDTA do not interfere. Only oxalate, acetate, hydrogen\
    \ peroxide, tin, cobalt, bismuth, titanium, osmium and ruthenium interfered in\
    \ the procedure. The method has been applied satisfactorily for the determination\
    \ of molybdenum in varieties of samples."
