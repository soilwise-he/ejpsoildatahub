  title: Effect of Footing Shape on Bearing Capacity and Settlement of Closely Spaced
    Footings on Sandy Soil
  abstract: The bearing capacity of closely spaced shallow footings alters with their
    spacing and the shape of footing. In this study, the bearing capacity and settlement
    of two adjacent footings constructed on a sand layer are investigated. The effect
    of different footing shapes including square, circular, ring and strip on sandy
    soil is captured in the calculations. The investigations are carried out numerically
    using PLAXIS-3D software and analytically employing conventional settlement equations.
    For this purpose, foundations are modelled in the program with practical dimensions
    and various spacing ratios ranging from 1 to 5. The spacing ratio is defined as
    the centre-to-centre distance to the width of foundations (S/B). Overall, 24 models
    are analyzed; and the results are compared and discussed in detail. It can be
    concluded that the presence of adjacent foundation leads to the reduction in bearing
    capacity for round shape footings while it can increase the bearing capacity of
    rectangular footings in some specific distances.
