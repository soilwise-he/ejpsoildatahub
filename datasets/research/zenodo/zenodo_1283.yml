  title: An Experimental Study on Stabilization of Loose Soil by Using Jute Fiber
  abstract: 'Stabilization is one of the methods of modifying the properties of a
    soil to improve its index parameters as well as strength parameters and it can
    be used for a variety of engineering works. Expansive soil is the major problem
    for civil engineers, either for construction of road and foundation works by using
    the stability of soil and reduces the construction cost. soil is stabilized by
    in objectives of this research were to investigate the effect of Jute fiber on
    the engineering property optimum moisture content and maximum dry density, plastic
    limit, liquid limit, compaction, unconfined compressive strength, triaxial and
    California bearing ratio test of the soil. Jute fiber is most suitable for increasing
    the strength of the soil and it is eco friendly material. In the present study,
    the soil samples prepared with the addition of Jute fibers by 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75
    , and 1 the average length of Jute fiber is going to use in this study is approximately
    10 15mm. At first, Optimum Moisture Content OMC was determined through the proctor
    test. At those OMC, several tests like CBR, UCS were conducted. CBR test was carried
    in both Unsoaked and soaked condition and maximum values were obtained where 0.75
    Jute fiber was added. K. Ravi Kanth | K. Deepthi "An Experimental Study on Stabilization
