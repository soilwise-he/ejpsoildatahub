  title: Reliability of Buried Pipes in Heterogeneous Soil Subjected to Seismic Loads
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctions and failures of buried pipe networks, like sewer\
    \ networks, are studied in this paper from the point of view of structural reliability\
    \ and heterogeneity of geotechnical conditions in the longitudinal direction.\
    \ Combined soil spatial variability and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) induce\
    \ stresses and displacements. A model has been developed within the frame of geostatistics\
    \ and a mechanical description of the soil\u2013structure interaction of a set\
    \ of buried pipes with connections resting on the soil by a two-parameter model\
    \ (Pasternak model). Structural reliability analysis is performed considering\
    \ two limit states: Serviceability Limit State (SLS), related to large \"counter\
    \ slope\" in a given pipe, and Ultimate Limit State (ULS), corresponding to bending\
    \ moment.&lt;/p&gt;"
