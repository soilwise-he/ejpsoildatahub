  title: PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS DEPENDING ON THE METHODS OF SOIL TILLAGE
    IN THE CONDITIONS OF POLISSYA OF UKRAINE
  abstract: One of the key tasks of modern agriculture is effective management of
    the soil ecosystem, preventing the spread of soil degradation processes and preserving
    its energy potential. In this sense, the aim of the study was to study the possibility
    of improving the main agrophysical and hydro-physical indicators of the arable
    layer of light gray forest soil as a component of managing the fertility of light
    soils in Polesya and the formation of productive agrocenosis.
