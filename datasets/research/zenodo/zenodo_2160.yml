  title: Some soil parameters in relation to macrophyte abundance along the Manatee
    habitat along River Benue, Nigeria
  abstract: "Some soil parameters as well as the aquatic flora\_ along river Benue\
    \ were analyzed.The results indicated that ten plants were identified as manatee\
    \ food plants and these include; Cynodon, dactylon, Digitaria horizontalis, Eichornia\
    \ crassipes, Ipomea aquatica, Vossia cuspidata, Viteveria flavibarbis, Quisqualis\
    \ indica, Polygonium acuminatum, Pistia stratiotes and cardiospermun halicacabum,\
    \ the most palatable species were Vossia cuspidata, Viteveria flavibarbis, Digitaria\
    \ horizontalis, Eichornia crassipes in decreasing order. There was significant\
    \ differences in the pH value of soils in the four sampling stations. The pH value\
    \ for Abinsi (6.50) and Makurdi (6.68) were not significantly different from those\
    \ of Gbaji (7.70) and Gbajimba (7.68). This is interesting in that the gradient\
    \ along the river would have indicated otherwise. The potassium content of the\
    \ soil in the four sampling stations did not indicate any significant differences\
    \ as well as the phosphorus content of the soil. The potassium content of the\
    \ soil ranged from 2.74Mg/kg in Makurdi to 2.78Mg/kg in Abinsi while the phosphorus\
    \ content was between 0.46 Mg/kg for Gbaji to 0.72Mg/kg in Abinsi. The soil Nitrogen\
    \ content indicate significant differences in the four sampling stations in the\
    \ study area. The value in Abinsi (3.74Mg/kg) and Gbajimba (4.10Mg/kg) are significantly\
    \ different from those of Gbaji (5.12mg/kg) and Makurdi (4.22Mg/kg) and Abinsi-Gbajimba\
    \ and that of Gbaji. The soil parameter in the four sampling stations relate with\
    \ the plant species richness of the stations and agrees with the report of FAO\
    \ (2018) that soils and vegetation have a reciprocal relationship."
