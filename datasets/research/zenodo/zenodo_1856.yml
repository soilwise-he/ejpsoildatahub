  title: Heat of Transport of Aqueous Ammonium Chloride and Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate
    in a Saline Soil
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Boil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya Kalyani-741 235<br> <em>Manuscript received 11 June 1986,\
    \ accepted 13 November 1986</em> Thermal diffusion of aqueous ammonium chloride\
    \ and potassium dihydrogen phos\xADphate at different mean concentrations was\
    \ studied by using a three-chamber non-isothermal cell, and the corresponding\
    \ heat of transport values (\\(\\hat{Q}\\)) were calculated by using a relation\
    \ based on irreversible thermodynamics. The graphical extrapolation of \\(\\hat{Q}\\\
    )<em> </em>to zero concentration yielded the beat of transport value at infinite\
    \ dilution (\\(\\hat{Q}\\)\xB0). The results are qualitatively interpreted in\
    \ terms of the difference between the 'local' degree of ordering in water in the\
    \ bulk solution as compared to that in contact with the soil particles."
