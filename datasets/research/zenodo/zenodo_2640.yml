  title: Isolation and molecular identification of soil bacteria exhibiting a broad-spectrum
    of antibacterial activity against multi-drug resistant strains
  abstract: <strong>Due to the increase in drug-resistant in pathogens, the search
    for new antibiotics from an unexplored natural environment is gaining momentum
    to combat Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The genus bacillus has been found
    as a prolific source of antibacterial metabolites synthesis. The current study
    was intended to isolate antibacterial metabolites producing <em>Bacillus spp</em>.
    From the unexplored region of Pakistan. Initially, 49 <em>Bacillus spp</em>. Were
    isolated from 9 soil samples and evaluated for antibacterial activity against
    a set of American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and MDR clinical bacterial strains.
    The isolate MK-12.1 antagonized the growth of ATCC, as well as MDR pathogenic
    bacterial strains, was selected for further study. The antibacterial metabolites
    were characterized and confirmed to be protein in nature, showed no hemolysis
    on human blood agarand molecular weight was &gt;20 kDa. The antibacterial metabolite
    producing bacterial isolate was identified as <em>Bacillus safensis</em> strain
    MK-12.1 on the basis 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis supported with biochemical
    testing. Various culturing parameters such as temperature, pH, incubation time
    and growth medium were optimized for growth and antibacterial metabolites synthesis.
    The optimum antibacterial activity and biomass was achieved at pH 8, 30 <sup>0</sup>C
    after 48 hours in the shaking incubator when cultured in modified OPT medium.
    The present study revealed that soil of Kohat, Pakistan is rich in terms of antibacterial
    metabolites producing bacteria and could be a good source for antibacterial which
    leads to fight against MDR bacteria in the future.</strong>
