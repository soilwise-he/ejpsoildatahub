  title: Legume-Based Mobile Green Manure Can Increase Soil Nitrogen Availability
    and Yield of Organic Greenhouse Tomatoes
  abstract: "Information about the availability of soil mineral nitrogen (N) in organic\
    \ greenhouse<br> tomatoes after the application of mobile green manure (MGM),\
    \ and its impact on plant nutrient<br> status and yield is scarce. Considering\
    \ this knowledge gap, the effects of legume biomass from faba<br> beans that are\
    \ cultivated outdoors (FAB), or from feed-grade alfalfa pellets at two different\
    \ doses<br> (AAL = 330 g m\U001000002; AAH = 660 g m\U001000002) that were applied\
    \ as MGM on the nutrition and yield of<br> an organic greenhouse crop of tomatoes\
    \ were evaluated. All of the MGM treatments increased the<br> mineral N concentrations\
    \ in the soil throughout the cropping period, and the total N concentration<br>\
    \ in tomato leaves when compared to the untreated control. FAB and AAH treatments\
    \ had a stronger<br> impact than AAL in all of the measured parameters. In addition,\
    \ AAL, AAH, and FAB treatments<br> increased the yield compared to the control\
    \ by 19%, 33%, and 36%, respectively. The application of<br> MGM, either as faba\
    \ bean fresh biomass or as alfalfa dry pellets, in organic greenhouse tomatoes<br>\
    \ significantly increased the plant available soil N, improved N nutrition, and\
    \ enhanced the fruit yield.<br> However, the N mineralization rates after the\
    \ MGM application were excessive during the initial<br> cropping stages, followed\
    \ by a marked decrease thereafter. This may impose an N deficiency during<br>\
    \ the late cropping period."
