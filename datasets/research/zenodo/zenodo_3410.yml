  title: Phytoadaptation In Desert Soil Prediction Using Fuzzy Logic Modeling
  abstract: In terms of ecology forecast effects of desertification, the purpose of
    this study is to develop a predictive model of growth and adaptation of species
    in arid environment and bioclimatic conditions. The impact of climate change and
    the desertification phenomena is the result of combined effects in magnitude and
    frequency of these phenomena. Like the data involved in the phytopathogenic process
    and bacteria growth in arid soil occur in an uncertain environment because of
    their complexity, it becomes necessary to have a suitable methodology for the
    analysis of these variables. The basic principles of fuzzy logic those are perfectly
    suited to this process. As input variables, we consider the physical parameters,
    soil type, bacteria nature, and plant species concerned. The result output variable
    is the adaptability of the species expressed by the growth rate or extinction.
    As a conclusion, we prevent the possible strategies for adaptation, with or without
    shifting areas of plantation and nature adequate vegetation.
