  title: Soil Micronutrients Linked to Human Health in India
  abstract: The repository contains code used to process data, analyze data, and create
    figures and tables for Morton et al. It also contains the publicly available raw
    data files used in the study. Since the raw data used from the National Family
    Health Surveys (NFHS) requires registration, it is not included in the repository,
    but we have provided sufficient information to retrieve the health data and covariates
    used in the study. Since the Bihar shapefile was purchased by Stanford University
    for use by Stanford affiliates, it is not included in the repository. Interim
    and processed data files are available upon request, and, for files containing
    NFHS data, proof of registration with the NFHS. Interim and processed data files
    containing Bihar shapefile data are not available to non-Stanford University affiliates,
    but are available to Stanford University affiliates or upon proof of license to
    use the data.
