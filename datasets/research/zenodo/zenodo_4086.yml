  title: Pearl Millet and Cowpea Yields as Influenced by Tillage, Soil Amendment and
    Cropping System in the Sahel of Burkina Faso
  abstract: "Sole cropped pearl millet and intercropped pearl millet with cowpea are\
    \ the dominant cropping systems in the Sahelien agroecological zone of Burkina\
    \ Faso with low and stagnant pearl millet and cowpea yields. Two experiments were\
    \ conducted in randomized complete block designs with split plot arrangements\
    \ and three replications. The main plot was tillage method in both experiments\
    \ and the sub-plot was soil amendment (compost, fertilizer, and crop residues).\
    \ The objective was to identify the best combination of tillage method, cropping\
    \ system, and soil amendment to optimize sole and intercropped millet and intercropped\
    \ cowpea yields. In Exp. 1, sole crop millet grain yield was increased by soil\
    \ amendment application from 238 kg ha-1 to 450 to 768 kg ha-1, and stover yields\
    \ from 551 kg ha-1 to 1075 to 1813 kg ha-1. In Exp. 2, za\xEF tillage increased\
    \ sole cropped millet grain yield by 348 to 495 kg ha-1, and intercropped millet\
    \ by 194 to 202 kg ha-1 over use of no till and scarify. Combined za\xEF with\
    \ C + F application increased sole cropped millet grain yield from 288 to 777\
    \ kg ha-1 and intercropped millet from 114 to 502 kg ha-1 over za\xEF without\
    \ soil amendment. Similar trends were observed for millet stover and intercropped\
    \ cowpea grain and stover yields. Influence of soil amendment application on grain\
    \ and stover yields was greatest for sole cropped millet with use of za\xEF in\
    \ high rainfall years. This first documentation of differential soil amendment\
    \ response of sole and intercropped pearl millet with za\xEF, scarify, and no\
    \ till systems indicates that the greatest pearl millet grain and stover yield\
    \ is obtained with application of plough or za\xEF in combination with C + F,\
    \ F + CR or C + F + CR soil amendment.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V82019072136\
