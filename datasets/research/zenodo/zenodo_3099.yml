  title: 'An exploratory study on farmer''s vernacular knowledge about the land characteristics,
    soil quality and crop suitability in Lower Ganga Flood Plain: Bangladesh Perspective'
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>Local people\
    \ and small scale farmer had a broad understanding of their land characteristics\
    \ and soil quality to choose crop. Though Maximum farmers in our country are illiterate\
    \ and little educated; they have no enough scientific knowledge about land type,\
    \ soil quality and crop suitability. But they possess vast indigenous knowledge\
    \ by living in a same environment for a long period of time. </em><em>They have\
    \ developed some strategies that helped them to attain a higher degree of satisfaction\
    \ in farming.</em><em> So therefore it is very important to explore the farmer\u2019\
    s vernacular knowledge about the land type, soil quality and crop suitability.\
    \ To address this indigenous knowledge this study investigates the farmer\u2019\
    s vernacular knowledge about the land type, soil quality and crop suitability\
    \ in Lower Ganga Flood Plain in Bangladesh. </em><em>The information was collected\
    \ from one Mouza in</em><em> Nagarkanda upazila, Faridpur district Lower Ganga\
    \ Flood Plain in Bangladesh</em><em>. Qualitative and quantitative both data were\
    \ used in this study. The data were collected from primary sources (such as questionnaire\
    \ survey, FGD) and secondary data sources (such as books, journals, and published\
    \ and unpublished research reports). Data were analyzed by exploratory statistics.\
    \ Graphs and graph tables were created by MS excel. By analyzing the Field data\
    \ </em><em>it was investigated that farmers of the study area recognized four\
    \ elevation levels of land; i). High Land</em><em> (Vitta) ii). Medium Land (Taner\
    \ Jomi) iii). Low Land (Nall/Dhop) iv).Very Low (Beel) based on its elevation,\
    \ flood depth, land use, and crop suitability. The farmers of the study area possess\
    \ considerable knowledge of the soils quality, moisture conditions of that area.\
    \ The farmers of the study area distinguish soil into three categories primarily\
    \ on the basis of color, texture, organic matter content, drainage, and fertility\
    \ of soils. They use indigenous methods such as visual observation while color,\
    \ tasting by tongue, feeling, vegetation cover and rubbing with fingers to determine\
    \ various soil properties. </em><em>Thus Farmers\u2019 knowledge of soils is,\
    \ therefore, a vast resource we summarized in this paper</em><em>.</em>"
