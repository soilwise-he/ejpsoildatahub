  title: 'Influence of Pesticides on the Trace Element Status of Soils : Part II.
    Effect of Nemagon on the Manganese and Iron Status of a Saline Soil'
  abstract: Section of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Aligarh Muslim University,
    Aligarh. <em>Manuscript received 4 July 1975; revised 29 November 1975; accepted
    6 December 1975</em> The effects of different doses of nemagon (1.2-dibromo-3
    chloropropane) on the Mn and Fe status of a saline sodic soil over a period of
    90 days were examined and the variance ratio, L.S.D. and correlation coefficients
    calculated. The results revealed that 0.3 ml of the pesticide per kg. of soil
    at an Interval of 30 days produced a most favourable significant response on water
    soluble, exchangeable and active Mn as well as on available and exchangeable Fe.
    All these constituents were positively correlated to each other. However, a negative
    correlation was observed between active and reducible Mn. The effect of the chemical
    started declining after a period of 4 weeks. The responses have been explained
    on the basis of chemical and microbiological activity in the soil.
