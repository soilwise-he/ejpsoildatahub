  title: An Investigation of Petrol Metabolizing Bacteria Isolated from Contaminated
    Soil Samples Collected from Various Fuel Stations
  abstract: "AbstractThe present study aimed to isolate the high-efficiency petrol\
    \ metabolizing thermophilic bacteria from petrol contaminated soil samples. Isolation\
    \ was carried out through enrichment culture, serial dilution and pour plate methods\
    \ using the petrol supplemented minimal salt media. The isolated bacteria were\
    \ analyzed to document growth behavior, petrol removal efficiencies, antibiotic\
    \ resistance profile, and biochemical characteristics. The 16S rRNA based phylogenetic\
    \ analysis helped to reveal the identity of isolated bacterial species and construct\
    \ the phylogenetic trees. Total nine bacteria were isolated, out of which three\
    \ (IUBP2, IUBP3, IUBP5) were identified as Brevibacillus formosus, one (IUBP1)\
    \ was found similar to Brevibacillus agri, four (IUBP7, IUBP8, IUBP13, and IUBP14)\
    \ shared homology with Burkholderia lata, and one (IUBP15) with Burkholderia pyrrocinia.\
    \ All the isolates were fast growing and exhibited considerable petrol degradation\
    \ potential. The highest petrol removal efficiency (69.5% \xB1 13.44/6 days) was\
    \ recorded for the strain IUBP15 at a petrol concentration of 0.1% (v/v). All\
    \ bacteria studied (100%) were positive for esculinase and phosphatase. Many strains\
    \ exhibited positive responses for arginine dehydrolase (22%), \u03B2-naphthylamidase\
    \ (11%), \u03B2-D-glucosaminide (33%), mannitol (55%), sorbitol (66%) and inulin\
    \ (88%) fermentation test. While all were sensitive to the antibiotics, some of\
    \ them were found resistant against chloramphenicol and oxacillin. The remarkable\
    \ biochemical characteristics and considerable petrol removal potential (40\u2013\
    70%) highlights utilization of the bacteria isolated for petrol bioremediation,\
    \ mineralization of organophosphates, dairy and food industry, and also as biofertilizers\
    \ and biocontrol agents."
