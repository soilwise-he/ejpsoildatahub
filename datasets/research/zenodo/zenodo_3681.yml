  title: Review of Brick Waste in Expansive Soil Stabilization and Other Civil Engineering
    Applications
  abstract: The expansive clay soils are spread in a large area all over the world.
    They are one of the predominated problematic soils which can change their volume
    and loss their shear strength when they exposed to water. Several methods have
    been used to mitigate the negative effects of expansive soil on civil engineering
    structures and constructions. Different materials have been applied in these stabilization
    methods (physical or chemical stabilization). Wastes from construction and demolition
    of the buildings are among these materials that used as soil stabilizer agents.
    This paper presents a critical review on one of construction and demolition wastes
    materials, i.e. brick waste, which is found in large quantiles. The characterization
    and utilization of brick waste in stabilization of expansive soil and other civil
    engineering applications was discussed and presented in this paper.
