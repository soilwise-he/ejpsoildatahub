  title: Investigating plant response to soil characteristics and slope positions
    in a small catchment
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Methods enabling stakeholders to receive information on plant\
    \ stress in agricultural settings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in a timely manner can help\
    \ mitigate a possible decrease in plant productivity. The present work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;aims\
    \ to study the soil\u2013plant interaction using field measurements of plant reflectance,\
    \ soil water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;content, and selected soil physical and chemical\
    \ parameters. Particular emphasis was placed on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sloping transects.\
    \ We further compared ground- and Sentinel-2 satellite-based Normalized Vegetation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Index\
    \ (NDVI) time series data in different land use types. The Photochemical Reflectance\
    \ Index (PRI)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and NDVI were measured concurrently with calculating\
    \ the fraction of absorbed photochemically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;active radiation\
    \ (fAPAR) and leaf area index (LAI) values of three vegetation types (a grassland,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;three\
    \ vineyard sites, and a cropland with maize). Each land use site had an upper\
    \ and a lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;study point of a given slope. The NDVI, fAPAR,\
    \ and LAI averaged values were the lowest for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the grassland\
    \ (0.293, 0.197, and 0.51, respectively), which showed the highest signs of water\
    \ stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maize had the highest NDVI values (0.653) among vegetation\
    \ types. Slope position affected NDVI,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRI, and fAPAR values\
    \ significantly for the grassland and cropland (p &lt; 0.05), while the soil water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;content\
    \ (SWC) was different for all three vineyard sites (p &lt; 0.05). The strongest\
    \ connections were&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;observed between soil physical and chemical\
    \ parameters and NDVI values for the vineyard samples&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the\
    \ selected soil parameters and PRI for the grassland. Measured and satellite-retrieved\
    \ NDVI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;values of the different land use types were compared,\
    \ and strong correlations (r = 0.761) between&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the methods were\
    \ found. For the maize, the satellite-based NDVI values were higher, while for\
    \ the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;grassland they were slightly lower compared to the field-based\
    \ measurements. Our study indicated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;that incorporating Sentinel-derived\
    \ NDVI can greatly improve the value of field monitoring and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;provides\
    \ an opportunity to extend field research in more depth. The present study further\
    \ highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the close relations in the soil\u2013plant\u2013\
    water system, and continuous monitoring can greatly help in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;developing\
    \ site-specific climate change mitigating methods.&lt;/p&gt;"
