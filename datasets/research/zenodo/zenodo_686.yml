  title: ROLE OF HUMUS SUBSTANCES IN THE SOIL-PLANT SYSTEM
  abstract: The article presents the results of experimental studies of the composition
    and nature of humic acids isolatedfrom agricultural waste. It has been established
    that the use of vermitechnology makes it possible to obtain themost condensed
    humic acids. The maximum amount of carboxyl groups (COOH) is contained in humic
    acidsisolated from vermicompost, and the minimum in humic acids extracted from
    cattle manure. The functional groupsof fulvic acids are dominated by phenolic
    hydroxyls. The total number of functional groups of fulvic acids isalmost 2 times
    greater than that of humic acids
