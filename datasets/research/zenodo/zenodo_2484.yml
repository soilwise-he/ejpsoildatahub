  title: Soil carbon storage as influenced by tree cover in the Dehesa cork oak silvopasture
    of central-western Spain
  abstract: "The extent of carbon (C) stored in soils depends on a number of factors\
    \ including soil characteristics, climatic and other environmental conditions,\
    \ and management practices. Such information, however, is lacking for silvopastoral\
    \ systems in Spain. This study quantified the amounts of soil C stored at various\
    \ depths (0\u201325, 25\u201350, 50\u201375, and 75\u2013100 cm) under a Dehesa\
    \ cork oak (Quercus suber L.) silvopasture at varying distances (2, 5, and 15\
    \ m) to trees. Soil C in the whole soil and three soil fractions (&lt;53, 53\u2013\
    250, and 250\u20132000 mm) was determined. Results showed soil depth to be a significant\
    \ factor in soil C stocks in all soil particle sizes. Distance to tree was a significant\
    \ factor determining soil C stocks in the whole soil and the 250\u20132000 mmsoil\
    \ fraction. To 1mdepth, mean total C storage at 2, 5, and 15m from cork oak was\
    \ 50.2, 37, and 26.5 Mg ha1, respectively. Taking into account proportions of\
    \ land surface area containing these C stocks at varying distances to trees to\
    \ 1 m depth, with a tree density of 35 stems ha1, estimated landscape soil C is\
    \ 29.9 Mg ha1. Greater soil C stocks directly underneath the tree canopy suggest\
    \ that maintaining or increasing tree cover, where lost from disease or management,\
    \ may increase long term storage of soil C in Mediterranean silvopastoral systems.\
    \ The results also demonstrate the use of soil aggregate characteristics as better\
    \ indicators of soil C sequestration potential and thus a tool for environmental\
    \ monitoring."
