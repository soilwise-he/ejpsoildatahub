  title: 'Extent and impact of microplastics on soil nutrients and biota: a trade-off
    assessment'
  abstract: 'While water treatment plants effectively remove microplastics from influent
    water, microplastics get concentrated in the sludge. This sewage is subsequently
    spread in agricultural soils for crop production. Sewage sludge can supply a large
    part of the nitrogen or phosphorus that most crops need. It''s also a good source
    of organic matter that can improve the water-retaining capacity and structure
    of soil. However, sludge contains potentially toxic elements, such as heavy metals,
    pathogens, antibiotics, as well as microplastics. Once in soil, microplastics
    could induce changes in soil fertility and also pose a potential threat to plant
    performance and crop productivity. The objective of this study is to review the
    extent of microplastics added from the sludge, the potential impacts of sludge
    amendment on nutrient availability and soil biota, in order to reveal the trade-off
    between benefits and risks of using sewage sludge from the perspective of microplastic
    pollutants. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/426896/document'
