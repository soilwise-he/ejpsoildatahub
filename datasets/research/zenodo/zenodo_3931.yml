  title: Effect Of Bamboo Chips In Cemented Sand Soil On Permeability And Mechanical
    Properties In Triaxial Compression
  abstract: Cement utilization to improve the properties of soil is a well-known method
    applied in field. However, its addition in large quantity must be controlled.
    This study presents utilization of natural and environmental-friendly material
    mixed with small amount of cement content in soil improvement, i.e. bamboo chips.
    Absorbability, elongation, and flatness ratio of bamboo chips were examined to
    investigate and understand the influence of its characteristics in the mixture.
    Improvement of dilation behavior as a problem of loose and poorly graded sand
    soil is discussed. Bamboo chips are able to improve the permeability value that
    affects the dilation behavior of cemented sand soil. It is proved by the stress
    path as the result of triaxial compression test in the undrained condition. The
    effect of size and content variation of bamboo chips, as well as the curing time
    variation are presented and discussed.<br>
