  title: 'Biological Soil Conservation Planning By Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation
    Techniques (Case Study: Bonkuh Watershed In Iran)'
  abstract: 'This paper discusses site selection process for

    biological soil conservation planning. It was supported by a valuefocused

    approach and spatial multi-criteria evaluation techniques. A

    first set of spatial criteria was used to design a number of potential

    sites. Next, a new set of spatial and non-spatial criteria was

    employed, including the natural factors and the financial costs,

    together with the degree of suitability for the Bonkuh watershed to

    biological soil conservation planning and to recommend the most

    acceptable program. The whole process was facilitated by a new

    software tool that supports spatial multiple criteria evaluation, or

    SMCE in GIS software (ILWIS). The application of this tool,

    combined with a continual feedback by the public attentions, has

    provided an effective methodology to solve complex decisional

    problem in biological soil conservation planning.'
