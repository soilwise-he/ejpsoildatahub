  title: Sensitivity of the landslide model LAPSUS_LS to vegetation and soil parameters
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The influence of vegetation on slope stability is well understood
    at the slope level but scaling up to the catchment&lt;br&gt;

    level is still a challenge, partially because of a lack of suitable data to validate
    models. We tested the physical&lt;br&gt;

    landslide model, LAPSUS_LS, which models slope stability at the catchment scale.
    LAPSUS_LS combines a hydrological&lt;br&gt;

    model with a Limit Equilibrium Method model, and calculates the factor of safety
    of individual cells&lt;br&gt;

    based on their hydrological and geomorphological characteristics. We tested two
    types of vegetation on slope&lt;br&gt;

    stability: (i) coffee monoculture (Coffea arabica) and (ii) a mixed plantation
    of coffee and deep rooting Erythrina&lt;br&gt;

    (Erythrina poeppigiana) trees. Using soil and root data from Costa Rica, we performed
    simulations to test the&lt;br&gt;

    response of LAPSUS_LS to root reinforcement, soil bulk density, transmissivity,
    internal friction angle and depth&lt;br&gt;

    of shear plane. Furthermore, we modified the model to include biomass surcharge
    effect in the calculations.&lt;br&gt;

    Results show that LAPSUS_LS was most sensitive to changes in additional cohesion
    from roots. When the depth of&lt;br&gt;

    the shear plane was fixed at 1.0 m, slopes were not unstable. However, when the
    shear plane was fixed to 1.5 m,&lt;br&gt;

    the mixed plantation of coffee and trees stabilized slopes, but the coffee monoculture
    was highly unstable,&lt;br&gt;

    because root reinforcement was low at a depth of 1.5 m. Soil transmissivity had
    a limited impact on the results&lt;br&gt;

    compared to bulk density and internal friction angle. Biomass surcharge did not
    have any significant effect on&lt;br&gt;

    the simulations. In conclusion, LAPSUS_LS responded well to the soil and vegetation
    input data, and is a suitable&lt;br&gt;

    candidate for modeling the stability of vegetated slopes at the catchment level.&lt;/p&gt;'
