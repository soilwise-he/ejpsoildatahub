  title: Effect Of Marginal Quality Groundwater On Yield Of Cotton Crop And Soil Salinity
    Status
  abstract: 'In this paper, effect of marginal quality groundwater<br>

    on yield of cotton crop and soil salinity was studied. In this<br>

    connection, three irrigation treatments each with four replications<br>

    were applied. These treatments were i) use of canal water (T1), ii) use<br>

    of marginal quality groundwater from tubewell (T2), and iii)<br>

    conjunctive use by mixing with the ratio of 1:1 of canal water and<br>

    marginal quality tubewell water (T3).<br>

    Water was applied to the crop cultivated in Kharif season 2011; its<br>

    quantity has been measured using cut-throat flume. Total 11 watering<br>

    each of 50 mm depth have been applied from 20th April to 20th July,<br>

    2011. Further, irrigations were stopped due to monsoon rainfall up to<br>

    crop harvesting.<br>

    Maximum crop yield (seed cotton) was observed under T1 which<br>

    was 1,517 kg/ha followed by T3 (mixed canal and tubewell water)<br>

    having 1009 kg/ha and T2 i.e. marginal quality groundwater having<br>

    709 kg/ha. This concludes that crop yield in T2 and T3 in comparison<br>

    to T1was reduced by about 53 and 30% respectively.<br>

    It has been observed that yield of cotton crop is below potential<br>

    limit for three treatments due to unexpected rainfall at the time of full<br>

    flowering season; thus the yield was adversely affected.<br>

    However, salt deposition in soil profiles was not observed that is<br>

    due to leaching effect of heavy rainfall occurred during monsoon<br>

    season.'
