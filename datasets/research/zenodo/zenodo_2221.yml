  title: 'Soil and litter macrofauna in shelterbelts and adjacent cropland: changes
    in community structure after tree planting'
  abstract: "Studies were carried out in the vicinity of Turew near Pozna\u0144 (Western\
    \ Poland) in the years 2003 and 2004 in three midfield shelterbelts of different\
    \ age (150, 11, 6 years old) and along two transects across shelterbelt (6 and\
    \ 11 years old) &gt;ecotone&gt; field at distance 15 and 50 m from the shelterbelt.\
    \ The field located in deforested area was treated as the control. The studies\
    \ were aimed at estimating the changes in community structure (composition, density,\
    \ biomass) of soil and litter macrofauna, (mainly dipteran larvae), related to\
    \ shelterbelt age both within shelterbelts as in adjoining fields. The results\
    \ were compared to previous studies carried out in 1999-2000 in the same agricultural\
    \ landscape. The density and biomass of soil and litter macrofauna were many times\
    \ higher in shelterbelts (2824-870 ind. m[^-2] and 3782-521 mg.d.wt. m[^-2]) than\
    \ in fields (483-53 ind. m[^-2] and 101-12 mg.d.wt. m[^-2]) and increased with\
    \ the age of planted trees. The same was true for taxonomic richness. Ecotone\
    \ zone of both transects was characterised by the greatest density and biomass\
    \ of animals, mainly those of mobile epigeic animals, particularly the ants. The\
    \ density and biomass values were declining in the field with the increasing distance\
    \ from the shelterbelt. Across the transect of an older (10-11 years old) shelterbelt\
    \ and adjacent field the density and biomass of studied animals were higher in\
    \ all plots than across the younger (5-6 years old) one. It can be concluded,\
    \ that the effect of the shelterbelt increases with age of planted trees. The\
    \ results confirm the previous suggestions of the enhancement of the field macrofauna\
    \ by forested strips. The highest similarity in taxonomic and dominance structure\
    \ was found between the shelterbelts and their ecotones and they differed significantly\
    \ from those in the field."
