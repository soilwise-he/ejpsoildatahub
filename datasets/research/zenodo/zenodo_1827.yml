  title: Geotechnical Properties of Lateritic Soil at Some Selected Portions across
    Old Ogbomoso-Ilorin Road
  abstract: Road Network is considered very vital in the economy of any nation, especially
    in developing ones, like Nigeria. The old Ogbomoso-Ilorin road is in a failed
    state of which has been characterized with different form of road failures. This
    study investigates road failure at some selected portions across old Ogbomoso-Ilorin
    road. Digital Elevation Map and Land use map of the area were produced using Arc
    GIS 10.3. Three laterites samples were collected from the failed portion (washout)
    of the road for geotechnical analysis. Geotechnical properties (Sieve Analysis,
    Liquid limit, plastic limit, plastic Index, Optimum Moisture Content (OMC), Maximum
    Dry Density (MDD), California Bearing Ratio (soaked and unsoaked) were determined
    on the laterites. The results were compared with Federal Ministry of Work Specification
    for Roads. The percentage passing through sieve No. 200 for sample 1 and 3 is
    greater than 35% and for the sample 2 is less than 35. The liquid limit, plastic
    limit and plastic index for the laterites varied from 29-45, 20-31 and 9-17, respectively.
    The OMC, MDD and CBR soaked and unsoaked ranged from 8.0 to 8.30%, 2.01 to 2.22g/cm3,
    14-64% and 21-49% respectively. Laterite material from location 2 meets the specification
    to be used as Subgrade material. The geotechnical properties of both binder and
    wearing course materials are recommended.
