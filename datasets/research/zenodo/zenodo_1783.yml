  title: Proposition of Empirical Correlation Equation for Swell Parameters of Expansive
    Soil from Monwya Township
  abstract: 'This study presents the swelling parameters for expansive soil from Monywa
    Township, Saging Region. In various civil engineering projects, soil is used as
    a construction material and it supports structural foundation. Expansive clay
    soils swell when they are wetted and shrink when they are dried out. Volume changes
    of expansive soils can cause damages to structure resting on them. Therefore,
    it is essential to identify the existence of expansive soil at proposed construction
    site. The present study deals with the properties of expansive soils from Institute
    of Economic IE , Industrial Zone IZ and Hospital of Traditional Medicine HTM which
    are situated in Monywa Township, Sagaing Region. In order to identify and classify
    the expansive potential of expansive soils, performed tests on soils under study
    are Atterberg limit tests, Grain size analysis, Specific gravity test, Standard
    compaction test, Modified free swell index test and Consolidation test. Then,
    the expansive potential is qualitatively classified by various classification
    methods. In this study, swell potential and swell pressure are considered as the
    swell parameters. Empirical correlations for swell parameters of expansive soil
    from Monywa Township are proposed by using multiple linear regression analysis
    for three dimensional models based on free swell test results. Yee Win Shwe |
