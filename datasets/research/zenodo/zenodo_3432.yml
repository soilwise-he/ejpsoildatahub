  title: Identification and Characterization of Bacteria from Uranium Contaminated
    Soil
  abstract: "<em>This study was performed to identify and characterization of microbes\
    \ from uranium contaminated soil. The isolates was identified via gram\u2019s\
    \ staining and characterized by biochemical tests according to Bergey\u2019s Manual.\
    \ Three isolates were identified and purified for further analysis. C1 (Corynebacterium\
    \ xerosis), C2 (Bacillus pumilus) and (C3) Deinococcus grandis have been identified.\
    \ All isolates were showed positive result for alkaline phosphate production.\
    \ Further study to be needed to examine remove heavy metals from soil and water</em>."
