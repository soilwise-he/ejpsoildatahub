  title: STUDY ON GERMINATION OF RAJMA (PHASEOLUS VULGARIS.L) IN AMENDED SOIL
  abstract: "Abstract \n\nThe purpose of this research was to investigate the effects\
    \ of applying Plain Soil, Plain soil and vermicompost, Plain soil and Neem cake,\
    \ Plain soil and inorganic fertilizers on germination of\_ Rajma. Significant\
    \ differences in germination percentage were observed between amended soil and\
    \ Control (plain Soil). \n\nThe germination percentage was found maximum in plain\
    \ soil followed by amended soil with urea followed by amended soil with vermicompost\
    \ on 3rd day of seeding. On 4th day of seeding it was 100% in plain soil, 60%\
    \ in vermicompost amended soil 80% in urea amended soil and 50% in neem amended\
    \ soil. The conductivity and the protein content of the root stem and leaf has\
    \ also been estimated.\n\nKeywords: Germination percentage, vermicompost, plain\
    \ soil"
