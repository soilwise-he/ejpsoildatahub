  title: A Mathematical Model For Predicting Isothermal Soil Moisture Profiles Using
    Finite Difference Method
  abstract: Subgrade moisture content varies with environmental and soil conditions
    and has significant influence on pavement performance. Therefore, it is important
    to establish realistic estimates of expected subgrade moisture contents to account
    for the effects of this variable on predicted pavement performance during the
    design stage properly. The initial boundary soil suction profile for a given pavement
    is a critical factor in determining expected moisture variations in the subgrade
    for given pavement and climatic and soil conditions. Several numerical models
    have been developed for predicting water and solute transport in saturated and
    unsaturated subgrade soils. Soil hydraulic properties are required for quantitatively
    describing water and chemical transport processes in soils by the numerical models.
    The required hydraulic properties are hydraulic conductivity, water diffusivity,
    and specific water capacity. The objective of this paper was to determine isothermal
    moisture profiles in a soil fill and predict the soil moisture movement above
    the ground water table using a simple one-dimensional finite difference model.
