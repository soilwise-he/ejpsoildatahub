  title: Spatial distribution of Soil Permeability across Port Harcourt Area, Southeastern
    Nigeria
  abstract: "Abstract Data from 73 soil investigation reports, mainly soil Permeability\
    \ were used to prepare maps of the variation in the Permeability of the soils\
    \ in Port Harcourt and its environs on a scale of 1:5000 metres at depths of 3-10m,\
    \ 11-15m and 16-20m. Data processing and interpretation were made with the help\
    \ of different professional computer software some of which were; Microsoft office\
    \ tools for preparation, synthesis and analysis of data, Arc GIS 10.7, Strater\
    \ 5, Google Earth Pro, surfer 16, for preparation and manipulation of different\
    \ maps. The aim was to prepare these maps as a quick guide to land use planning,\
    \ design and construction of civil engineering structures. The permeability of\
    \ soil samples obtained at depths of 3-10m, 11-15m and 16-20m were 5 \xD7 10-5\
    \ to 1.2 \xD7 10-3, 4 \xD7 10-5 to 2 \xD7 10-4 and 8.0 \xD7 10-3 to 2.0 \xD7 10-3\
    \ m/secwith average values of 4\xD7 10-4, 3.72\xD7 10-4 and 9.30 \xD7 10-4m/sec\
    \ respectively indicating that the soils in Port Harcourt area mostly have rapid\
    \ flow rate of water. The soils are also rated as having medium to high permeability.\
    \ High permeability soils give rise to high seepage flows which lead to leakage,\
    \ tunnelling or breaking failure in earth dams. The linear regression analysis\
    \ shows that the relationship between depth and permeability is a significant\
    \ weak positive relationship indicating that as depth increases, permeability\
    \ increases. The prevalent engineering problems in the study area will most likely\
    \ be excessive settlement due to Flow of large volume of water from highly compressible\
    \ clays. These engineering geological maps were produced to guide decision makers\
    \ and planners in the land use allocation of the areas for sustainability."
