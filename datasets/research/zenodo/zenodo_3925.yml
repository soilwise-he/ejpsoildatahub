  title: DETERMINATION OF THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY FOR ADOBE (CLAY SOIL) MIXED WITH DIFFERENT
    PROPORTIONS OF QUARTZ (SHARP SAND)
  abstract: "This research investigated the thermal conductivity of Adobe mixed with\
    \ Quartz in view of their availability usage as building materials. The thermal\
    \ conductivities of disc made from AdobeQuartz chippings were determined. The\
    \ values of the thermal conductivities obtained were between 0.6Wm-1k-1and 0.9Wm-1k-1,\
    \ these values could be used to identify Adobe/Quartz as one of the engineering\
    \ materials used in building construction. Adobe/Quartz was prepared in discs\
    \ form of the same diameters and thicknesses and was also compressed under the\
    \ same pressure of 15 atmospheres (100: 0, 95: 5and 80: 20). The average values\
    \ of the thermal conductivities were between 0.07Wm-1\u04A0-1 and 0.93Wm-1\u04A0\
    -1, for sample contained the proportion of (80:20) and the sample of ratio (95:5).\
    \ MATLAB 7.0 and EXCEL software were used in the various computations, especially\
    \ in determining dT/dt, Root mean square error (RMSE), Curve fittings parameter\
    \ and the correlation coefficient, R2. An average correlation coefficient of 0.78\
    \ was existed between Adobe-Quartz ratio and thermal conductivity. The equation,\
    \ y = -0.11x2 + 0.01x + 1.03 is the general equation that can be used for the\
    \ prediction of average thermal conductivity at various ratios. Where y is the\
    \ average thermal conductivity and x here signifies the ratios. This also indicates\
    \ that compacted Adobe-Quartz of low density will be a suitable thermal insulator\
    \ when used as aggregates in walls."
