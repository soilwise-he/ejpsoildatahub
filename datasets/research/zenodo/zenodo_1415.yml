  title: Static and dynamic testing and design methods for driven piles in multilayered
    soil
  abstract: This paper summarizes the results of static and dynamic pile load tests
    performed on fully instrumented, driven piles<br> in Indiana. The soil profiles
    at the test site locations consist of multiple layers of soils that are typical
    of alluvial<br> deposits found at bridge sites. In most of the cases considered,
    closed-ended and open-ended pipe piles were driven<br> side-by-side and tested
    to allow a comparison of the resistances mobilized in each layer of the soil profile
    and at the<br> bases of the piles. For robustness and redundancy of the measurements,
    the piles were instrumented with a dense<br> arrangement of electrical-resistance
    and vibrating-wire strain gauges along the entire length of the piles. The openended<br>
    pipe piles were specially built with a double-wall system to allow separation
    of the internal and external<br> resistances. Slow-maintained static load test
    protocols were followed to obtain the pile load-settlement curves with<br> appropriate
    stiffness values. The tests were performed to large pile head settlements to allow
    determination of ultimate<br> loads. Dynamic load tests were also performed to
    assess their ability to predict static resistances. The results of these<br> tests
    were compared with predictions made using recent hybrid CPT-based design methods
    and pile driving formulas<br> applied to measured sets during driving. An assessment
    of the methods of prediction or verification of ultimate<br> resistances is made
    based on the results.
