  title: Effect of Soil Type on the Growth of Terminalia ivorensis (A. Chev.)
  abstract: '<em>Terminalia ivorensis </em>is a tree species found in lowland rainforest
    zone in Nigeria but is predominantly a tree of seasonal forest zones. Nursery
    experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of soil type on the growth
    of <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em>. Different soil types were collected namely:
    sandy, clay and loamy soils. Seeds of <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em> were broadcasted
    on a germination bed at the college nursery and later, were transplanted into
    polythene pots containing the different soil types. The parameters assessed include
    total height, stem diameter and leaf production. <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em>
    seeds grown on loamy soil gave the best result in both total height and stem diameter
    (10.22 cm and 0.20 cm respectively) while <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em> seeds
    raised on sandy soil gave the best result for leaf count (8.17). Seeds of <em>Terminalia
    ivorensis </em>performed better on sandy soil, best on loamy soil and less on
    clay soil. Seeds of <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em> performed well in total height
    on loamy soil (9.48 cm), in stem diameter on sandy soil (0.17 cm) and in number
    of leaves both in sandy and clay soil (7.25). The seeds of <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em>
    performed well in total height and stem diameter on loamy soil (9.97 cm and 0.19
    cm respectively) and had the same value for number of leaves in the three soil
    samples (7.08). Based on the findings of this work, it is hereby recommended that
    <em>Terminalia ivorensis</em> seedlings should be raised using loamy soil.'
