  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil erosion is one of the most devastating problems in Sri
    Lanka, which threatens the sustainability of Agriculture. To design future policy
    and effective outreach, this study examines the factors behind farmers&rsquo;
    decision making attitude of soil conservation. The study was conducted in Ratnapura
    District. Hundred tea smallholder farmers were selected by following multistage
    random sampling, and primary data were collected through administrating a pre-tested
    structured questionnaire. Pearson correlation coefficient was employed between
    soil conservation attitude which was measured on a scale that consisted of 15
    soil conservation measures, and farmers&rsquo; socio-economic and other factors
    considered in the study. Results obtained that age, level of education, income,
    property size, and, awareness on soil erosion, and associated problems with it
    were influencing on decision-making attitude of soil conservation while gender
    was not a significant factor. The study suggested obtaining farmers&rsquo; decision-making
    in soil conservation practices will require the use of various implementation
    tools such as subsidy, technical assistance, teaching, and extension efforts as
    well as it should facilitate regional social capital formulation to enable and
    thrive in the collective decision of soil conservation.&lt;/p&gt;'
