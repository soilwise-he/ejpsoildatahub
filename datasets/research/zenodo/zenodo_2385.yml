  title: Unpacking the legal conundrum of nature-based soil remediation and sustainable
    biofuels production in the European Union
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The fight against soil contamination and the development of
    sustainable fuels constitute major environmental and climate change objectives
    under the European Green Deal. At the same time, the uptake of nature-based solutions
    is increasingly advocated in the European Union as viable techniques to enhance
    soil ecosystem services while addressing the soil vs. food vs. energy conundrum
    to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the European Green Deal objectives.
    This contribution deals with unlocking the potential of phytoremediation both
    a soil remediation technique and a source of sustainable feedstock for advanced
    biofuels. Phytoremediation consists of the use of plants and their associated
    microbes to extract, volatilize, stabilize, or degrade soil pollutants. Furthermore,
    phytoremediation''s by-products may be used to develop advanced, low indirect
    land use change biofuels thus contributing to the EU''s climate change mitigation
    objectives. The value chain entailed in the deployment of phytoremediation techniques
    and recovery of phytoremediation''s output materials for biofuels production faces
    an array of legal and policy roadblocks in the European Union. Importantly, such
    barriers relate both to material legal obstacles, policy fragmentation and lack
    of a holistic approach towards complex processes. This contribution aims to provide
    a comprehensive overview of such legal and policy roadblocks with a view to champion
    the embedding of phytoremediation in the existing EU legal framework also in relation
    to the development of low-Indirect Land Use Change biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;'
