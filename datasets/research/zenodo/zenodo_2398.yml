  title: Improvement of the model of forecasting heavy metals of exhaust gases of
    motor vehicles in the soil
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Consideration of the problem of modeling the penetration of\
    \ heavy metals of exhaust gases of automobile engines is carried out for the soil\
    \ with permeability coefficient c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and diffusion coefficient\
    \ D. As a result of mathematical modeling, an exponential equation is obtained,\
    \ the input variables for which are the surface concentration of harmful components\
    \ c, permeability coefficient c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, diffusion coefficient\
    \ D and soil depth l. The output variables for the obtained exponential equation\
    \ is the concentration of harmful components C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;at\
    \ a depth l.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to the obtained equation, the depth\
    \ of penetration of heavy metals into the soil &ndash; l is theoretically investigated,\
    \ depending on the surface concentration \u0441&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;\u02C2\u0441\
    &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and at constant ratio c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/D.\
    \ As a result, the penetration depth of heavy metals increases, which is due to\
    \ an increase in the driving force of the diffusion process. Having studied the\
    \ effect of an increase in the c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/D ratio on the penetration\
    \ depth of heavy metals into the soil at constant surface concentrations c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and\
    \ c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a decrease in their penetration depth is found, which\
    \ is due to a decrease in the diffusion process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obtained\
    \ theoretical results are confirmed by experimental studies of the depth of penetration\
    \ of heavy metals &ndash; exhaust gases of the ZMZ-511.10 petrol engine into the\
    \ soil. It is found that the content of heavy metals in the soil at an arbitrary\
    \ depth corresponds to theoretical calculations, and the discrepancy is within\
    \ the measurement error. When measuring the lead concentration, the discrepancy\
    \ is within 12.5&ndash;15&nbsp;%, zinc 5.5&ndash;7.5&nbsp;%, manganese 8.5&ndash;11&nbsp;%.\
    \ So, the concentrations of heavy metals, measured at arbitrary depths, are 0.1\
    \ and 0.2 m for lead; 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 m for zinc; 0.1; 0.2 and 0.25 m for manganese.\
    \ This indicates the validity of the results obtained by the exponential equation.\
    \ Therefore, the proposed model provides high accuracy in determining the concentration\
    \ of heavy metals in the soil and can be used for forecasting their penetration\
    \ depth if the surface concentration is known&lt;/p&gt;"
