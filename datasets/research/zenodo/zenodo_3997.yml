  title: Geotechnical Study of the Properties of Black Cotton Soil Treated with Cement
    and Bone Ash as Admixture
  abstract: 'In this study, an attempt was made to assess the effectiveness of black
    cotton soil blended with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and bone ash (BA) for
    soil stabilization. The study was therefore about improvement of the properties
    of black cotton soil with bone ash admixed with ordinary Portland cement and the
    determination of the optimum quantity that could be used as road construction
    material at minimal cost. Bone generated waste from slaughter houses (abattoirs)
    could be effectively utilized for civil engineering construction works, aiming
    at minimizing the disposal problems and reducing the environmental hazard. The
    preliminary investigation on the black cotton soil collected along Gombe-Biu road
    in Yamaltu (Baure village) Yamaltu Deba Local Government area of Gombe state Nigeria,
    shows that the soil belongs to A-7-6 (31) in the American Association of State
    Highway and Transport Officers and CH in the Unified Soil Classification Systems
    (USCS), respectively. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC)/Bone ash (BA) blend in stepped
    concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8% and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% respectively, by
    dry weight of soil, were used to treat the soil. Compaction was carried out using
    three energy levels namely: the British Standard Light, West African Standard
    and the British Standard Heavy. The liquid limit decreased steadily from 65% for
    the natural soil to 55.5% at 6% OPC / 6% BA content, while the plasticity index
    decreased from 28.49% for the natural soil to 16.5% at 6% OPC / 6% BA treatment.
    Generally, the maximum dry density (MDD) increased while optimum moisture content
    (OMC) decreased with higher BA treatment. The UCS values of specimens treated
    with 6% OPC / 6% BA increased from 752, 779 and 827kN/m2 for the natural soil
    to 1688, 2250 and 2667kN/m2 when cured for 7, 14 and 28 days, respectively. There
    was an increase in the unsoaked CBR values from 6, 9 and 12% for the natural soil
    compacted with BSL, WAS and BSH energy levels to 48, 80 and 85% at 6% OPC / 6%
    BA content. The soaked CBR values of 4, 7 and 9% for the natural soil compacted
    with BSL, WAS and BSH energies, respectively, increased to peak values of 43,
    71 and 74% at 6% OPC / 6% BA content. Based on the results obtained the optimum
    of 6% OPC / 6% BA treatment on the black cotton soil could be used as sub-base
    material when compacted with BSH. The study therefore recommended that a 50% replacement
    of cement by the bone ash can be made to achieve a desired material for sub-base
    pavement construction at a reduced cost.'
