  title: "Effect of Salt Solution on Plasticity and Permeability of Vietnam\u2019\
    s Soil Liners"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In Vietnam, there are a lot of landfills to block pollutants
    and one of materials used for impermeable liners is soil liners (soil &ndash;
    bentonite mixture). In order to use as impermeable liners, the properties of soil
    liners such as plasticity and permeability were affected by many salt solutions
    which are leaching from decomposition of waste materials in the landfills. Those
    salt solutions can reduce the stable of impermeable liners. So, this paper presents
    a series of experimental studies in the laboratory to investigate the effect of
    some salt solutions on the properties of compaction, consolidation and plasticity
    of soil liners. The experimental results indicated that the salt concentration
    effected complex on the Atterberg limits and the vertical coefficient of permeability.
    It also found that increase in the salt concentration from 0N to 0.05N cause increase
    in plasticity index, liquid limit and decrease in the vertical coefficient of
    permeability. After that, the increasing of the salt concentration up to 1N resulted
    in decrease in the liquid limit and plasticity index and increase in the vertical
    coefficient of permeability increases.&lt;/p&gt;'
