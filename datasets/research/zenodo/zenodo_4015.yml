  title: DEVELOPMENT EQUATION FOR DETERMINATION THE START TIME OF SEEPAGE UNDER HYDRAULIC
    STRUCTURE RESTING ON SOIL CONTAINING A CAVITY
  abstract: This study aims to introduce a formula for determination the start time
    of seepage when single cavity presence at a specific location within the homogenous
    soil under a hydraulic structure. The investigation aims to observe the effect
    of cavity locations and size on the start time of seepage. The experimental work
    has been done in three stages, the first stage includes 36 models of 75mm in diameter
    cavity, while the second and the third stages includes eight models for each with
    100mm and 34mm diameter of cavity respectively. The analysis of result shows that,
    generally, the effect of cavity was positive in term of increasing the time of
    starting the seepage. To generate the deterministic formula the SPSS statistical
    software was used and the results of multiple regressions are checked by statistical
    indices. By this process more realistic formula has been proposed with acceptable
    reliability.
