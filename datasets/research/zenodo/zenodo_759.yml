  title: EFFECT OF FLUORIDE CONTAMINATION ON MICROBIAL ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY IN SOIL
  abstract: The accumulation of environmental contaminant such as fluoride in wetlands
    especially in rice fields is increasing drastically by the action of fertilizers,
    pesticides, mining, waste disposal, and atmospheric pollution of which Kuttanad,
    the unique tropical wetland agro ecosystem is not an exception. Accumulation of
    excess F<sup>-</sup> in the environment poses serious burden to all organisms.
    Since soil microbial enzymes respond more quickly to various environmental conditions
    and soil management practices than any other soil quality parameters and thus
    used to detect early the changes in the soil health. In view of this, the activities
    of various enzymes involved in the biogeochemical cycles such as urease, protease,
    dehydrogenase, arylsulphatase, acid and alkaline phosphatase were investigated.
    Result showed thatF<sup>-</sup> had an inhibitory effect on the activity of all
    the enzymes studied possibly due to the adverse effect of F<sup>-</sup> on microorganisms.
