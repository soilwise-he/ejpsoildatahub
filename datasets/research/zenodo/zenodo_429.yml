  title: A Study of the Potential of Selected Soil Inoculants, Soil Conditioners,
    and Foliar Fertilizer to Enhance Upland Rice Production
  abstract: "The rising cost of farm inputs (fertilizers) results higher production\
    \ expenses in rice farming, thus meeting the country's growing demand for food\
    \ is at stake due to lack of capital for production. Philippines agriculture department\
    \ pinned several strategies to boost rice production through new varieties and\
    \ mechanization to secure food sufficiency. To contribute on boosting rice production\
    \ this study was encapsulated, evaluating the efficacy of selected soil inoculants,\
    \ soil conditioner and organic foliar fertilizers on agronomic, yield, and yield\
    \ components of rice (NSIC Rc 27) was the objective. A completely randomized block\
    \ design was used in the study (RCBD) with eight (8) treatments: T1 \u2013 Farmers\
    \ practice (Slash and Burn), T2 \u2013 Recommended Rate of Fertilizers, T3 \u2013\
    \ Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alone, T4 \u2013 Carrageenan alone, T5 \u2013 Carbonized\
    \ Rice Hull + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, T6 \u2013 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\
    \ + Kappaphycus drippings, T7 - 50% RRF + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens + Carrageenan\
    \ and T8 - 50 % RRF + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and replicated thrice in a 4m\
    \ x 5m standard size with a total area of 646m2 with the duration of two years.\
    \ The research was carried out at Davao de Oro State College's research laboratory\
    \ at Compostela, Davao de Oro. Agronomic parameters, meteorological data, yield\
    \ and yield components, and economic analysis were collected. The results confirmed\
    \ that using various approaches increased upland rice production by up to 3.9\
    \ tons per hectare. On the other hand, soil conditioner and soil inoculant like\
    \ carbonized rice hull (CRH) and Bacillus spp could improve soil health by increasing\
    \ organic matter resulting to better absorption of nutrients correlating to higher\
    \ production. Keywords: food security; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Carrageenan;\
    \ Carbonized Rice Hull (CRH), Kappaphycus drippings"
