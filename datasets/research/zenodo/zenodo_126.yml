  title: Geotechnical Study Of Baghdad Soil
  abstract: This paper comprises the study and analysis of Baghdad soil for 23 geotechnical
    properties which were extracted from field tests of 630 boreholes with depth taken
    to 30m and representing 200 sites. Soil investigation reports are collected from
    different laboratory tests. The soil layers were divided into each 2m, which means
    15 studied layers and the soil properties values were adopted and submitted in
    tables and digital maps to represent the variation of soil properties values with
    depth and relationships between the properties values. Different softwares and
    tools were implemented for digital maps preparation. The results clarify that
    Baghdad upper soil layer is mainly fill with poor strength. The stratum is erratic
    and non-homogenous with water levels near the natural ground surface. Baghdad
    soil is generally alkaline with high concentration of sulphates in the upper layers.
