  title: Optimized Workflow Framework in Construction Projects to Control the Environmental
    Properties of Soil
  abstract: "To optimize the workflow of civil engineering construction in a harbour,\
    \ this paper developed a framework of the contaminant leaching assessment carried\
    \ out on the stabilized/solidified dredged soil material. The specimens included\
    \ the sampled sediments collected from the in situ fieldwork in Arendal and Kongshavn.\
    \ The background levels of the concentration of pollutants were evaluated to assess\
    \ the cumulative surface leaching of substances from samples over two months.\
    \ The contamination of soil was assessed using a structured workflow scheme on\
    \ the following toxic substances, heavy metals\u2014As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, and\
    \ Zn; organic compounds\u2014PAH-16 and PCB; and organotin compounds\u2014TBT.\
    \ The numerical computation and data analysis were applied to the results of geochemical\
    \ testing creating computerised solutions to soil quality evaluation in civil\
    \ engineering. Data modelling enabled the estimation of leaching of the contaminants\
    \ in one year. The estimated leaching of As is 0.9153 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, for Ni\u2014\
    2.8178 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, for total PAH-16 as 0.0507 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and for\
    \ TBT\u20140.00061 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per year. The performance of the sediments\
    \ was examined with regard to permeability through a series of the controlled\
    \ experiments. The environmental engineering tests were implemented in the Swedish\
    \ Geotechnical Institute (SGI) in a triplicate mode over 64 days. The results\
    \ were compared for several sites and showed that the amount of As is slightly\
    \ higher in Kongshavn than for Arendal, while the content of Cd, Cr, and Ni is\
    \ lower. For TBT, the levels are significantly lower than for those at Arendal.\
    \ The algorithm of permeability tests evaluated the safety of foundation soil\
    \ for construction of embankments and structures. The optimized assessment methods\
    \ were applied for monitoring coastal areas through the evaluated permeability\
    \ of soil and estimated leaching rates of heavy metals, PHB, PACs, and TBT in\
    \ selected test sites in harbours of southern Norway."
