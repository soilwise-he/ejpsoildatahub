  title: HYGIENIC SUBSTANTIATION OF WORKING CONDITIONS OF WORKERS DEVELOPING VEGETABLES
    UNDER THE OPEN SOIL CONDITIONS
  abstract: <strong>Resume:</strong> In this article, the purpose of the study is
    a hygienic assessment of the working conditions of workers engaged in the cultivation
    of vegetables in open ground. It has been established that when growing vegetables
    workers can be affected by such production factors as high physical activity,
    dust, noise, vibration, carbon monoxide, summer insolation, relatively low temperatures
    in the autumn-winter period, vapors and gases of mineral fertilizers and pesticides.
    . In this regard, sanitary inspection of the working conditions of vegetable growers
    should be carried out taking into account the specific features of the cultivation
    of vegetable crops.
