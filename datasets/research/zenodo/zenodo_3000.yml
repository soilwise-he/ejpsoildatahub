  title: An Appraisal Of Productivity, Nutrient Uptake And Soil Fertility Status In
    Fenugreek (Trigonella Foenum-Graecum L.) Under An Integrated Nutrient Management
    Module
  abstract: 'A field experiment during winter seasons of 2001-03 was conducted at
    Pantnagar on a clay loam soil to appraise the productivity, nutrient uptake and
    soil fertility status in fenugreek under an integrated nutrient management module.
    The results indicated highest total biological yield (70.71q ha ), total N (224.45
    kg ha ), P (11.78kg ha ) andK(161.39 kg ha ) uptake in the treatment NPK+ Sinorhizobium
    + Bacillus + FYM@5.0 t ha . The mean effect on post harvest soil fertility status
    in the both the years observed to be highest in the same treatment recognizing
    the

    need for incorporating microbial inoculants in integrated nutrient management
    module. Soil organic carbon was strongly correlated with post harvest availableN

    (r = 0.858**), P (r = 0.803**) and K (r = 0.819**). Pearson''s correlation analysis
    revealed statistically significant and positive correlation existed among seed
    and

    straw yield with nutrient uptakes (r = 0.84** to 0.90**). Total biological yield
    was significantly correlated with total N uptake (r = 0.86**) and total P uptake
    (r = 0.87**) indicating positive response of N and P release microbial inoculants.
    Linear and non-linear regression equations were developed to estimate the productivity
    as function of soil properties and nutrient uptakes. Such models could

    be applied in predicting yield variations and assessing soil health of fenugreek
    grown under diverse agroecological regions. Power functions were generated to
    estimate the seed yield of fenugreek, which suggested that availableN(r = 0.81**)
    and K (r = 0.80**) were found to be most appropriate in explaining variation in
    seed yield of fenugreek. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository
    service in June, 2017 before shutting down.'
