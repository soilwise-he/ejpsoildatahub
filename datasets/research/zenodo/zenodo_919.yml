  title: Identification of the optimal soil-crop association/agronomic practice pairs
  abstract: "This\_milestone has the objective to provide an overview of the optimal\
    \ soil-crop association/agronomic practice pairs among all those tested by the\
    \ different partners in the Case Study (CS). The identification of the optimal\
    \ pairs has been done in strict collaboration with the responsible of each CSs.\
    \ To summarize the results and allow for a comprehensive evaluation, the same\
    \ set of criteria was used for all the CSs, namely: yield (t/ha), gross margin\
    \ (Euros/ha or Euros/tons), soil organic carbon (g/kg), and total nitrogen (g/kg)\
    \ as exemplary of ecosystem services. With the aim to facilitate the reading of\
    \ the document, the diversification is reported by country. \n\nEvaluation of\
    \ the diversified cropping systems showed that in many cases the introduction\
    \ of new crops in rotation in arable land or intercropped as cover crops in permanent\
    \ crops improved not only environmental aspects related to SOC and Total N concentration,\
    \ but also economic aspects related to the gross margin.\n\nIn general, is important\
    \ to find a trade-off between the environmental and economic factors by selecting\
    \ the right crops to be used for diversification.\n\n\_"
