  title: STUDY ON THE GROWTH RESPONSE OF PHYSIC NUT TO VARIOUS SOIL TYPES.
  abstract: A field work has been conducted to study the impact of soil over the growth
    and seed output of Jatropha (Physic nut) for a period of three years at Krishna
    district of Andhra Pradesh selecting different Jatropha plantations. Various parameters
    like mean height, mean girth, average number of branches per plant were observed
    along with the phenological output with a regular interval in the study sites
    to compare the growth of Jatropha in varied soil conditions.Results revealed that
    both the physical growth and fruit yield were recorded comparatively high in the
    black gravel soils among all the field stations. Details of the study were mentioned
    here in the full paper.
