  title: Modelling of electrokinetic techniques for soil remediation and ground improvement.
    State of the art and assessment of research opportunities.
  abstract: "This paper presents a review of the state of the art concerning the simulation\
    \ of\_electrokinetic techniques used in soil stabilisation and remediation processes.\
    \ The main\_THMC models as well as those specifically designed for the simulation\
    \ of electrokinetic\_phenomena have been presented. After evaluating the main\
    \ characteristics of each of\_them, the need for a THMC model that also considers\
    \ electrokinetic phenomena and their\_coupling with other physic-chemical processes\
    \ has been identified."
