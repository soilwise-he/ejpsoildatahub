  title: Influence Of Watertable Depth On Soil Sodicity And Salinity
  abstract: 'In order to monitor the water table depth on soil profile

    salinity buildup, a field study was carried out during 2006-07. Wheat

    (Rabi) and Sorghum (Kharif) fodder were sown in with three

    treatments. The results showed that watertable depth lowered from

    1.15m to 2.89 m depth at the end of experiment. With lower of

    watertable depth, pH, ECe and SAR decreased under crops both

    without and with gypsum and increased in fallowing. Soil moisture

    depletion was directly proportional to lowering of watertable. With the

    application of irrigation water (58cm) pH, ECe and SAR were reduced

    in cropped plots, reduction was higher in gypsum applied plots than

    non-gypsum plots. In case of fallowing, there was increase in pH, EC,

    while slight reduction occurred in SAR values. However, soil salinity

    showed an increasing upward trend under fallowing and its value in

    0-30 cm soil layer was the highest amongst the treatments.'
