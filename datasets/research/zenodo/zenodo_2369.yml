  title: Effect Of Soil Liming On European Beech (Fagus Sylvatica L.) And Sycamore
    Maple (Acer Pseudoplatanus L.) Plantations
  abstract: "Support of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sycamore maple (Acer\
    \ pseudoplatanus L.) plantations by amelioration has been tested in air-polluted\
    \ sites in the mountains since 1993. The research locality is a site with humic<br>\n\
    podzol soils at an altitude of 960 m a.s.l. Dolomitic limestone (1 kg per tree)\
    \ was mixed with soil used for planting tree seedlings. According to the results\
    \ of a 15-year investigation (1993\u2013 2008), liming had a positive effect on\
    \ beech<br>\ntree growth, while the positive effect of liming on tree growth was\
    \ temporary in the case of sycamores. Ca content was higher in the limed beech\
    \ plantations throughout the observation period. Soil analyses (sampled in 2002)\
    \ showed<br>\nthat the application of dolomitic limestone influenced soil conditions\
    \ markedly in terms of increased pH. The pH values measured in H2O increased from\
    \ 4.9 to 6.2 for beeches and from 4.3 to 6.1 for sycamores."
