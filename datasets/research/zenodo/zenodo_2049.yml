  title: Effect of Palm Bunch Ash on Soil pH And Growth of Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus
    L)
  abstract: "A field experiment to assess the effect Palm Bunch Ash (PBA), at various\
    \ levels (0, 2, 4t/ha) on the pH of soil and growth of Cucumis sativus at the\
    \ Teaching and Research Farm, Rivers State University, Port Harcourt, was conducted.\
    \ Soil samples (0 \u2013 15cm) before and after application, from the experimental\
    \ plots were collected, and analyzed with standard methods for pH and nutrients.\
    \ Also, Palm Bunch Ash (PBA) sub-sampled, and analyzed with standard methods for\
    \ pH used for the experiment. A total of 9 treatments were used with A<sub>0</sub>\
    \ (Control), A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>4, </sub>where A represents PB<strong>A,</strong>\
    \ and the subscripts 0, 2 and 4 represent the treatment levels. The experiment\
    \ was a 1x3 factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replicates.\
    \ 18 seeds of cucumber (2 per hole) from NSPRI, Rumueme, Port Harcourt were planted\
    \ on each treatment plot of 2 x 2m at a plant spacing of 45 \xD7 45cm. Thereafter,\
    \ it was thinned to one (1) per hole after emergence. This implies that, there\
    \ were a total number of 10,000 plants per hectare. Growth parameters include\
    \ shoot height (cm), 3, 6 and 9WAP, and Number of leaves, 3, 6 and 9WAP. Data\
    \ generated from field were subjected to one-way ANOVA test using the Minitab\
    \ package and the means were separated using Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference\
    \ at 95% probability. The results revealed that pH increased (p&lt;0.05) as the\
    \ amendment level increased in the treated soil with the highest 6.00 of 4t/ha.\
    \ Also, there was significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on growth, as the PBA level increased\
    \ in the treated soil with the highest values 13.97cm recorded in 2t/ha, and 48.13cm\
    \ and 77.90cm recorded in 4t/ha for 3, 6, and 9WAP. Similarly, for number of leaves,\
    \ the highest values were recorded in 4t/ha, also for 3, 6, and 9WAP. Hence, PBA\
    \ is recommended as good amendments for acid soil neutralizer and nutrient buffer\
    \ and supplier to the soil and ultimately to plants."
