  title: Jigger Flea (Tunga Penetrans) Infestations And Use Of Soil-Cow Dung-Ash Mixture
    As A Flea Control Method In Eastern Uganda
  abstract: Despite several interventions, jigger flea infestations continue to be
    reported in the Busoga sub-region in Eastern Uganda. The purpose of this study
    was to identify factors that expose the indigenous people to jigger flea infestations
    and evaluate the effectiveness of any indigenous materials used in flea control
    by the affected communities. Flea compositions in residences were described, factors
    associated with flea infestation and indigenous materials used in flea control
    were evaluated. Field surveys were conducted in the affected communities after
    obtaining preliminary information on jigger infestation from the offices of the
    District Health Inspectors to identify the affected villages and households. Informed
    consent was then sought from the local authorities and household heads to conduct
    the study. Focus group discussions were conducted with key district informants,
    namely, the District Health Inspectors, District Entomologists and representatives
    from the District Health Office. A GPS coordinate was taken at central point at
    every household enrolled. Fleas were trapped inside residences using <em>Kilonzo
    traps. </em>A <em>Kilonzo Trap</em> comprised a shallow pan, about three centimetres
    deep, filled to the brim with water. The edges of the pan were smeared with Vaseline
    to prevent fleas from crawling out. Traps were placed in the evening and checked
    every morning the following day. The trapped fleas were collected in labelled
    vials filled with 70% aqueous ethanol and taken to the laboratory for identification.
    Socio-economic and environmental data were collected. The results indicate that
    the commonest flea trapped in the residences was the cat flea (<em>Ctenocephalides</em>
    <em>felis</em>) (50%), followed by Jigger flea (<em>Tunga penetrans</em>) (46%)
    and rat flea (<em>Xenopsylla Cheopis</em>) (4%), respectively. The average size
    of residences was seven squire metres with a mean of six occupants. The residences
    were generally untidy; with loose dusty floors and the brick walls were not plastered.
    The majority of the jigger affected households were headed by peasants (86.7%)
    and artisans (13.3%). The household heads mainly stopped at primary school level
    (80%) and few at secondary school level (20%). The jigger affected households
    were mainly headed by peasants of low socioeconomic status. The affected community
    members use soil-cow dung-ash mixture to smear floors of residences as the only
    measure to control fleas. This method was found to be ineffective in controlling
    the insects. The study recommends that home improvement campaigns be continued
    in the affected communities to improve sanitation and hygiene in residences as
    one of the interventions to combat flea infestations. Other cheap, available and
    effective means should be identified to curb jigger flea infestations.
