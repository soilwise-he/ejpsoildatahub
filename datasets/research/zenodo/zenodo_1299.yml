  title: Enhancement of Strength Characteristics of Poorly Graded Soil by Flyash and
    Cement
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Fly Ash is the waste material, which is obtained after burning
    coal in Thermal Power Plants. It can be used as a stabilizer for soil due to its
    pozzolanic effect or an inherent self hardening property under favourable conditions
    of moisture and compaction. This project aims at increasing the strength of poorly
    graded soils by using Fly Ash and cement as admixtures. Some percentage of Fly
    Ash without any additives was utilized so as to reduce the cost of construction
    and this is a good method for disposal of it. Fly Ash was added in various percentages
    like 10, 20, 30 and 40 percentages by volume . Initially all basic Geotechnical
    properties of the soil such as liquid limit, plastic limit, shrinkage limit, Grain
    Size Analysis, Specific Gravity, Free Swell Index, Unconfined Compressive Strength,
    OMC and MDD were determined. Later on the stabilized mixes were tested for CBR
    California Bearing Ratio which is an indirect measurement of strength. After the
    detailed experimental investigation it is observed that 30 addition of Fly Ash
    has shown maximum strengths, so that to obtain much more strengths cement was
    added in 2, 5, 8 and 10 percentages to this optimum mix of Fly Ash with soil.
    After that the soil mixes were tested for CBR California Bearing Ratio to check
    it&#39;s feasibility in Flexible Pavement constructions. The strengths were checked
    in both Unsoaked and soaked conditions and at various curing periods like 7 and
    28 Days. Among all proportions 30 Fly Ash 8 of the cement has shown maximum strengths,
    so that it was decided as optimum mix. Maximum strengths were obtained at 28 days
    curing period for all proportions of mixes so that this period is decided as optimum
    curing period. Eventually this project work facilitates an economical, strong
    and durable construction material for Flexible Pavements. Kammampati Laxman |
