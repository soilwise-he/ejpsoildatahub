  title: 'New records of soil dwelling mites of the superfamily Pygmephoroidea (Acari:
    Heterostimatina) from northern Iran'
  abstract: 'Following a short-term faunistic study on soil inhabiting heterostigmatic
    mites (Acari: Prostigmata: Heterostigmata), during springwinter 2019, in Gorgan,
    Golestan Province, northern Iran, a total of six species from five genera of two
    families were identified. Among them Promicrodispus pumilis (Sevastianov, 1975)
    and Premicrodispus montanus Khaustov, 2006 are new records for mite fauna of Iran.
    The genus Promicrodispus Khaustov, 2017 is recorded for the first time for the
    mite fauna of Iran. Moreover, Pre. akermanae (Sevastianov &amp; Al Douri, 1988),
    Paramicrodispus scarabidophilus Hajiqanbar &amp; Rahiminejad, 2012, Pygmodispus
    (Allodispus) latisternus Paoli, 1911 and Scutacarus sphaeroideus Karafiati, 1959
    were collected from soil in the sampling sites. The world distribution of the
    mites is reviewed.'
