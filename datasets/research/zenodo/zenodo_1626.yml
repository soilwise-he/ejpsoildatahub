  title: Dependence of Vertical and Horizontal Distribution of Juice in Nature on
    Soil-Climate Conditions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: Aphids play an important role in nature and human
    life. Nature these insects, which are a major component of landscape entomocenoses,
    have become pests of crops grown in cultivated cenoses. The specificity of soil-climatic
    conditions and vegetation cover in the vertical regions of South Fergana is reflected
    in the composition of the fauna of algae distributed at different absolute heights,
    as well as in their biological and ecological properties.&lt;/p&gt;'
