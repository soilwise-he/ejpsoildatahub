  title: A Review of Soil Contamination and Remediation on Basis of Case Studies
  abstract: <em>Soil contamination has increased over the past few decades, mainly
    due to petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides application, industrial
    wastes, and human activities. Suitable and standardized monitoring and remediation
    strategies are required to minimize soil contamination. In this sense, in the
    most recent decade, there has been a developing innovative technology on the usage
    of residues and waste materials, originating from various industries, many remediation
    innovations (Chemical degradation, photo- degradation) and bioremediation to clean
    polluted soils. The purpose of this article is to collect contributions from outstanding
    researches and experts involved in various fields of soil contamination and soil
    degradation with some case studies to highlights and future developments in the
    context of contaminated soil monitoring and remediation strategies. The article
    is planned into six topics containing an introduction, soil pollution, types and
    sources of soil pollution, soil contamination and degradation, soil remediation
    and some case studies. I hope that the composed data will be beneficial to soil
    contamination researchers, (e.g., geologists, engineers, and biologists to get
    an overview of soil contamination and degradation</em>
