  title: 'Gypsum amendment and seasonal variability: effect on soil quality, fruit
    characteristics and toxicological responses of Cucumber (Cucumis sativus l.) in
    the Ahafo-Kenyasi Mining Area of Ghana'
  abstract: Depending on soil, climate and crop characteristics exposed subsoils can
    be amended with gypsum for agricultural activities when topsoil is inadequate
    as a result of natural and geophysical activities. To determine how exposed subsoil
    amendment with gypsum interact with weather patterns to influence soil chemical
    properties, cucumber growth, fruit characteristics and heavy metal concentration,
    a two-seasonal experiment was conducted in the major and minor rainy season of
    2020 in the Ahafo-Kenyasi Mining Area in Ghana. The experiment was laid out as
    a 6x2 factorial arranged in randomized complete block design, consisting of 6
    gypsum application rates (20 ton/ha, 40 ton/ha, 60 ton/ha, 80 ton/ha, 0 ton/ha
    (subsoil control) and 0 ton/ha (topsoil control)) in two rainy seasons and replicated
    three times. The results show that gypsum application and rainy seasons interact
    to significantly influence soil chemical properties, cucumber growth and fruit
    characteristics. Increasing gypsum application resulted in decreased organic carbon,
    increased calcium, increased available P, increased exchangeable magnesium (Mg),
    increased pH during both major and minor rainy seasons. Vine length, number of
    leaves, number of fruits per plant and fruit weight of cucumber were increased
    with increasing gypsum application during the minor rainy season. In spite of
    exceeding permissible limits in soils and crops, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and
    mercury (Hg) showed similar concentrations (below 2 mg/kg) in cucumber during
    the minor and major rainy seasons across gypsum treatments. Lead (Pb) concentration
    in cucumber was significantly higher in the major season across treatments. There
    was no difference in lead (Pb) concentration for treated vs untreated, and no
    increase across the amendment range. Further studies on how heavy metals in soil
    and plants interact with plant phytochemicals in ecosystems and living tissues
    are recommended.
