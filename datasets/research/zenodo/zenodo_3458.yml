  title: Performance Evaluation Of Rotavator Based On Different Soil Moisture Content
  abstract: Rotary tillage implements are now being projected as important equipment
    that results in production of fine tilth soil. Preparation of an optimum seedbed
    condition by minimizing the time, cost and energy requirements has assumed considerable
    significance for the paddy-wheat farming system widely practiced in northern part
    of India. In order to study the effect of various parameters on the performance
    under actual field conditions, a rotary tiller was selected. Moisture content
    (11.27%, 17.04 % and 22.87%) was recorded in the different field conditions. The
    rear shield position was adjusted at full down, full up and middle positions and
    three different Forward speeds of the tractor 2.5 km/hr, 3.0 km/hr and 3.5 km/hr
    and three types   depth of cut 5cm, 8cm and 12cm. were used for the study. The
    study was undertaken to examine the influence of Forward speed, depth of cut at
    different moisture content fields with dependent parameters such as draft, fuel
    consumption, power consumption, field efficiency, and residue incorporation by
    rotavator. In this paper the results indicated that as the forward speed, shield
    position full down and depth of cut increases, the value of draft, fuel consumption,
    power consumption also increases
