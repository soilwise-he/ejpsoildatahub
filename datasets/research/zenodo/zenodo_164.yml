  title: MAINTAINING AND INCREASING SOIL FERTILITY
  abstract: This article discusses the methods of increasing the productivity of irrigated
    lands and their role in agriculture, and also the positive impact of these recommendations
    on the future development of agriculture in our country. The main task of reclamation
    measures of the new technology system is creating and maintaining optimal water,
    food and air regimes to ensure high and low yields of crops grown with efficient
    use of irrigation water and other sources. The period when the groundwater level
    raises the most corresponds to the periods of saline washing and vegetation irrigation.
    The level of mineralization of groundwater in this period is at its lowest.
