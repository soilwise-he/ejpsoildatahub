  title: 'Microbial Soil Enhancer: The Panacea to Land as a Limiting Resource in Agricultural
    Productivity'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land is an inevitable resource in agricultural
    production and its health status determines the position of agriculture in the
    present and future. The study investigated the ability of microbial soil enhancer
    to increase yield and soil nutrients, maintain soil health for sustainable and
    continuity in agriculture.&nbsp; Two (2.5ml/liter) of microbial soil enhancer
    was applied to the soil before planting and thereafter, 2ml/liter was applied
    through foliar application after every four weeks till maturity, followed by treatments
    with different rates&nbsp; of inorganic fertilizer NPK15:15:15 (20g/plant, 15g/plant,
    and 10g/plant). The study revealed that microbial soil enhancer gave the best-improved
    yield (52.67 Ton/Ha), SOM and many primary nutrients when used with 50% (10g/plant)
    inorganic fertilizer.&nbsp; Microbial soil enhancer improved and balanced the
    soil microorganism&#39;s community, making the soil fit for sustainable use and
    continuity in agriculture.&nbsp; It generated pro-bacteria and fungi needed for
    plant protection and productivity. The study also revealed that microbial soil
    enhancer should not be used in a virgin or fertile soil to avoid disaster outbreak.
    It is also good for bioremediation. It should be encouraged and supplemented with
    a low rate of inorganic fertilizer to increase yield, sustainability, and continuity
    in agriculture and also for bioremediation, to reclaim agricultural lands lost
    to pollution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
