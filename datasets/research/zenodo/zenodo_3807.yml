  title: Effect of EDTA and LMWOAs on Zinc Fraction Redistribution and Kinetic Release
    from Soil
  abstract: 'In the present investigation, we studied the speciation and kinetic aspects
    of Zinc (Zn) release from artificially Zinc contaminated soil, under the treatment
    of synthetic chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and low molecular
    weight organic acids (LMWOAs). Addition of EDTA and LMWOAs significantly increased
    the exchangeable fraction of Zn by 4.91-5.68, 3-4.33, 2.25- 2.89, 2.38-2.80 times
    under the treatment of EDTA, citric acid, oxalic acid, and malic acid respectively.
    Kinetic modeling (two first order reaction model) of Zn release vs. time distinguished
    two metal pools: readily labile and less labile. There was a high release of Zn
    by EDTA (24.9%-34.7%) compared to the LMWOA (4.3%-6.4%). In this study, it was
    also shown that the Q1of Zn released under the EDTA treatment was positively correlated
    with exchangeable, carbonate bound and Fe-Mn bound fractions suggesting that <br>
    EDTA can release Zn associated with these fractions, whereas LMWOA can release
    Zn only from exchangeable fraction.'
