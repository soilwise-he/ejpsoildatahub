  title: Investigation into the Settlement of a Case Study Building on Liquefiable
    Soil in Adapazari, Turkey
  abstract: "This paper investigates the key parameters that influenced the settlement\
    \ of a case study building on liquefiable soil in Adapazari (Turkey) during the\
    \ 1999 Kocaeli earthquake. Ground movements in Adapazari caused large devastation,\
    \ largely attributed to liquefaction of low plasticity silty soil layers underneath\
    \ buildings on shallow foundations. The case study soil profile was well characterized\
    \ by in-situ testing as well as laboratory tests from the Adapazari area. This\
    \ allowed several different estimates of the building settlement to be obtained\
    \ through different methods and through a variation in upper and lower bound estimates\
    \ of the soil parameters. The different methods and different soil properties\
    \ resulted in a wide range of estimates from 0.004 m to 1.6 m for the building\
    \ settlement, compared to the observed in-situ value of 0.9 m. Even though the\
    \ results were varied, the estimation of the liquefied strength of the soil appeared\
    \ to be a key parameter for the settlement of the case study building. A detailed\
    \ study with the PLAXIS finite-element software and UBC3D-PLM constitutive model,\
    \ provided a consistent estimate of the final settlement of 0.9 m compared to\
    \ the in-situ value. However, the limitation due to the enforced \u2018undrained\u2019\
    \ conditions during the dynamic phase of the analyses may have resulted in an\
    \ inaccurate simulation of the pore water pressure and subsequently could have\
    \ influenced the estimation of settlement. The modeling of the liquefaction settlements\
    \ under free-field conditions was also considerably less than the re-consolidation\
    \ settlements that were obtained through simplified procedures, suggesting that\
    \ the re-consolidation settlement under the foundation was not modelled accurately.\
    \ The present paper focuses on the assessment of the settlements due to earthquake-induced\
    \ liquefaction as part of the research being conducted within the European project\
