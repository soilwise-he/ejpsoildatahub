  title: 'The Current State Of Studying The Changes In The Forms And Bioavailability
    Of Copper And Zinc In The Soil-Plant System: Optimal Design Studies For Monitoring
    On Large Sample Arrays'
  abstract: "To describe the biotransformation of copper and zinc in the soil, the\
    \ directions of study of accumulation and transformation in soils of copper and\
    \ zinc in science are distinguished. These are studies of man-caused contaminated\
    \ areas that have developed under the influence of the anthropogenic factor \u2014\
    \ due to their proximity to industrial enterprises, location near cities; studies\
    \ with the artificial creation of a model of acculturation or man-made pollution\
    \ through the introduction of the element into the soil, through the introduction\
    \ of multicomponent fertilizer compositions in microfilm and field experiments.\
    \ The analysis of Russian and foreign scientific publications over the past 20\
    \ years has been done on the elibrary.ru portal, in the electronic catalog of\
    \ the Russian State Library, among the dissertations on earth sciences, foreign\
    \ electronic resources \u2014 Consortium of University Scientific Publishers Europe,\
    \ Google Academy, Web of Science, Scopus, ERIH PLUS, \xABNature\xBB registered.\n\
    \nStudies of changes in bioavailability and the fractional composition of zinc\
    \ and copper in a soil are analyzed, and the effect of these processes on organic\
    \ and mineral fertilizer systems is less influenced by the long-term application."
