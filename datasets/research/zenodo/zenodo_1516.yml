  title: Isolation and Biochemical Identification of Soil Bacteria from North Eastern
    Hill University, Shillong
  abstract: One of the richest habitats for microorganisms is soil due to its complex
    composition and availability of nutrients which has allowed for the greatest microbial
    diversity. This diversity is a blessing and a curse, as along with beneficial
    and non pathogenic microorganisms, it is also a hub for pathogenic microbes to
    thrive. In this diverse microflora, a plethora of microorganisms are yet to be
    discovered and understood. Due to the ever-changing climate conditions, global
    warming, pollution, erosion etc, there may be change in the microbial diversity
    in soil of a particular area and may lead to infection and spread diseases. 4
    different isolates were obtained from soil sample collected from the North Eastern
    Hill University campus, Shillong, Meghalaya and biochemically identified. 3 out
    of 4 isolates were identified to be pathogenic in nature. This paper aims to highlight
    the importance of estimating the soil microorganisms, understand their functions
    and make aware about the lurking dangers in our surroundings.
