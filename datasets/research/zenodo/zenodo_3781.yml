  title: Study On Seismic Performance Of Reinforced Soil Walls To Modify The Pseudo
    Static Method
  abstract: 'This study, tries to suggest a design method based on

    displacement using finite difference numerical modeling in

    reinforcing soil retaining wall with steel strip. In this case, dynamic

    loading characteristics such as duration, frequency, peak ground

    acceleration, geometrical characteristics of reinforced soil structure

    and type of the site are considered to correct the pseudo static method

    and finally introduce the pseudo static coefficient as a function of

    seismic performance level and peak ground acceleration. For this

    purpose, the influence of dynamic loading characteristics,

    reinforcement length, height of reinforced system and type of the site

    are investigated on seismic behavior of reinforcing soil retaining wall

    with steel strip. Numerical results illustrate that the seismic response

    of this type of wall is highly dependent to cumulative absolute

    velocity, maximum acceleration, and height and reinforcement length

    so that the reinforcement length can be introduced as the main factor

    in shape of failure. Considering the loading parameters, geometric parameters
    of the

    wall and type of the site showed that the used method in this study

    leads to efficient designs in comparison with other methods, which

    are usually based on limit-equilibrium concept. The outputs show the

    over-estimation of equilibrium design methods in comparison with

    proposed displacement based methods here.'
