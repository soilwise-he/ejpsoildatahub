  title: COEFFICIENTS OF UTILIZATION OF NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM FROM THE
    SOIL AND FERTILIZERS BY WINTER WHEAT AND BARLEY IN THE CONDITIONS OF IRRIGATION
  abstract: "In the irrigated soils of winter wheat and barley the problem of the\
    \ degree of absorption of nutrient elements from the soil and fertilizers is observed.\
    \ In the conditions of field experiments (2020-2022) the coefficient of the utilization\
    \ of nitrogen from the soil (CUS) by wheat and barley varied from 44,4 to 54,4%,\
    \ P2O5 \u2013 26,3-31,5 and K2O - 4,9-6,1%. Coefficients of the utilization from\
    \ mineral fertilizers (CUF) by the investigated plants were: nitrogen \u2013 49,6-82,8;\
    \ P2O5 \u2013 29,4-38,4 and K2O - 56,4-74,6%, and from semi-rotten manure and\
    \ biohumus \u2013 54,3- 70,4; 25,8-43,0 and 33,5-141,1%, respectively. The balance\
    \ coefficients of the utilization of nutrient elements by the investigated crops\
    \ in fertilized variants are higher than 100%, which explains the deficiency of\
    \ the applied doses of organic-mineral fertilizers (N120P80K90), as a result of\
    \ which in these farms the deficit of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium deepens\
    \ and is accompanied by gradual dehumufication of the soil."
