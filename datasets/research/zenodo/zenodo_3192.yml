  title: Morpho-anatomical characteristics and antimicrobial activity of crude extract
    of Tephrosia villosa (L.) Pers. growing on sandy soil of Phan Thiet City, Binh
    Thuan Province, Vietnam
  abstract: "<em>Tephrosia villosa</em> (L.) Pers. is an herb species distributed\
    \ mainly in arid sandy lands of the South Central Coast of Vietnam, including\
    \ Binh Thuan province. The existing Vietnamese folk remedies have mentioned the\
    \ medicinal effects of this herb in the treatment of edema and diabetes. Documents\
    \ available in Vietnam provided only basic information on the morphology of this\
    \ species. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the morphological and anatomical\
    \ characteristics of stems, leaves and roots of the plants in the analysis of\
    \ relation to climatic conditions of the region. Antibacterial activity was initially\
    \ studied as a basis for subsequent pharmacological studies. The crude ethanolic\
    \ extracts were tested for inhibitory against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>\
    \ and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> by agar well diffusion method. The results\
    \ showed that the plants had formed the morpho-anatomical characteristics to adapt\
    \ to strong wind, strong light, high temperature, and dry sandy soils of the region.\
    \ The ability to inhibit the two mentioned bacteria via the diameters of the halo\
    \ was 10.8 \u2013 12.7 mm, respectively. The recommendation was to continue to\
    \ study the anatomical characteristics of the primary roots to complete the data\
    \ and further investigate the antibacterial and antifungal activities of extracts\
    \ of <em>Tephrosia villosa</em>."
