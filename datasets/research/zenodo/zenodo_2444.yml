  title: Hardening Accelerators (X-Seed 100 BASF, PCC, LKD and SALT) as Strength-Enhancing
    Admixture Solutions for Soil Stabilization
  abstract: 'This study is aimed at evaluating the strength of stabilised soil collected
    from the Port of Norvik, Stockholm, Sweden, where 350,000 m 3 of clay had to be
    stabilized. The tests were performed in the laboratory of the Swedish Geotechnical
    Institute (SGI). The soil was stabilised by binder mixtures using Portland cement
    clinker (PCC) and lime and lime kiln dust (LKD). Accelerators (X-seed 100 BASF,
    PCC, LKD and salt) were added to the soil samples for quicker stabilization. The
    strength of the stabilised soil was assessed using resonance frequency measurements
    of seismic P-waves by an ICP accelerometer in order to estimate the shear strength
    of the soil and to evaluate the effects from the accelerators, binder ratios,
    and the curing temperature on the gains in stabilization and strength. Various
    proportions of the binders were tested, i.e.: 50/50 cement/lime and 50/50 PCC/lime.
    The temperature was measured using a calorimeter in double experiments. The results
    showed that the accelerators improve the strength in the stabilized specimens
    and enhance the soil performance for engineering construction work.'
