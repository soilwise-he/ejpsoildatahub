  title: Graph-analytical optimization of the transverse vertical cross-section of
    a contact zone between soil and an elastic wheeled mover
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The intensification of agricultural production under modern
    conditions implies the use of super-powerful mobile technical means, which leads
    to an increase in the levels of technogenic impact on soil and, consequently,
    deteriorates its fertility. Therefore, the most acute issue related to current
    agricultural production is aimed at resolving the task on improving the operational
    indicators of wheeled running systems of mobile technical means. This necessitates
    an analytical study into the processes of soil deformation under the elastic motors
    of mobile wheeled agricultural machinery.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;We have proposed a procedure of the graph-analytical step-by-step modeling
    of the process of soil deformation under pneumatic tires of mobile agricultural
    equipment taking into consideration the changing shape of an elastic tire sheath.
    Using appropriate graphic models makes it possible to explore, in stages, the
    process of soil compaction inside the profile of the track it formed. It has been
    found that in the contact area &laquo;deformed soil &ndash; the surface of an
    elastic wheeled mover of the mobile vehicle&raquo; the highest level of compaction
    is observed in the soil layer, which is directly in contact with the elastic mover.
    The depth of the recompacted soil layer on the &laquo;track bottom&raquo; depends
    on the dimensions of a tire of the wheeled mover and does not exceed the value
    of 0.075 width of the tire. The highest soil compaction level is observed in the
    area directly adjacent to the gauge. It has been established that the most dangerous
    design of a pneumatic tire, in terms of soil overcompaction in the track, is the
    shape of an elastic tire sheath that is described by the curve of the Cassini
    oval with four points of inflection. We have outlined distinctive features of
    recommendations to determine the operational values of tire working pressure depending
    on specific physical-mechanical and agro-technological properties of soil and
    the character of performed technological operations&lt;/p&gt;'
