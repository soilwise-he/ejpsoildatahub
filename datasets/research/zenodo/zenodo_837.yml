  title: 'Microbial-aided phytoremediation of heavy metals contaminated soil: a review'
  abstract: Anthropogenic exercises as well as industrial enterprise and agricultural
    practices contribute considerably to the degradation and contamination of environment
    that considerably affects the soil. The normal physical and chemical know-how
    soil washing used for soil remediation render the land useless as a medium for
    plant growth, as they take away all biological activities. Others are labor-intensive
    and have high maintenance value phytoremediation, a cheaper and sustainable in
    situ remediation technique was so thought of. This data can enable proposing solutions
    to issues of contamination and eventually convalescent sites and soils. However,
    plants don't have the aptitude to degrade several soil waste matters particularly
    the organic pollutant. It's so imperative to require advantage of the degrading
    ability of soil microorganisms. This review so focuses on phytoremediation techniques
    improved by microbial colonies.
