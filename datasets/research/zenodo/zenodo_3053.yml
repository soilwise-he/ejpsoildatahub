  title: A Study on the Effect of Phosphate, Molybdate and Humic acid Application
    on the Availability of Iron Manganese and Molybdenum in Laterite Soil
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp; Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani-741 235<br> <em>Manuscript received 17 January\
    \ 1982, revised 10 February 1986, accepted 8 May 1986</em> A typical laterite\
    \ soil of West Bengal was treated with phosphate, molybdate and humic acid singly\
    \ as well as in combination and incubated at moisture saturation. Both phosphate\
    \ and humic acid application showed considerable increase in Mo availability.\
    \ Mo application decreased the DTPA-extractable Fe but increased the available\
    \ Mn content of the soil. Phosphate application decreased both available Fe and\
    \ Ma. Humic acid did not change the available Fe content but available Mn content\
    \ was increased. Combined application of HA \u2014Mo, P\u2014Mo and HA \u2014\
    \ P as well as P \u2014HA \u2014Mo enhanced availability of Mo and Mn in the soil\
    \ but available Fe content was found to be depressed. With the increase in incubation\
    \ period, amount of available Mo and Fe gradually increased but Mn content showed\
    \ a decreasing trend after initial increase."
