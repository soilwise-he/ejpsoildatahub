  title: Soil Enzymes Assessment Around Amega Cement Factory in Nigeria.
  abstract: "High soil quality is important for agricultural activities but pollution\
    \ from cement industries is of great threat to sustainable agriculture in Nigeria.\
    \ The aim of this study is to assess the effect of heavy metals in cement dust\
    \ on the soil enzymes activities. This study investigated the activities of some\
    \ selected soil enzymes, the microbial communities\u2019 population, the concentrations\
    \ of some heavy metals, some selected soil macronutrients and the physico-chemical\
    \ properties (pH, moisture, and temperature) of the soil surface (0-15 cm), within\
    \ the vicinity of a cement factory in Nigeria. The pH, total organic nitrogen\
    \ (TON), total organic carbon (TOC) and heavy metals decreased with increasing\
    \ distance from the cement factory. The microbial population around the factory\
    \ was (34.00 \xB1 2.64 CFU g-1) and (92.00 \xB1 1.00 CFU g-1) at 100 m and the\
    \ control site respectively. All the soil heavy metals contents analyzed are less\
    \ than the permissible limit except Cd. Moreover, the enzyme activities increased\
    \ away from cement factory except alkaline phosphatase that decreases with increase\
    \ in distance. The enzymes activities (except alkaline phosphatase) correlated\
    \ negatively with the content of all heavy metals, the pH, the TON, the TOC and\
    \ temperature but positively correlated with moisture, phosphorous and microbial\
    \ populations. The inverse correlations between most of the heavy metals, the\
    \ pH and soil enzymes activities could be a result of the pollution. This means\
    \ that the cement production exhibits a significant effect on the enzyme activities."
