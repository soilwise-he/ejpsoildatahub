  title: Soil Water and Nitrogen Balance Study of Maize Using CERES Maize Model in
    DSSAT
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Simulated studies indicated that early sowing i.e 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ April (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) predicted highest grain yield during all the\
    \ years from 1986-2013. Under irrigated conditions increasing levels of N predicted\
    \ increased grain and stover yield from N levels up to 90 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.\
    \ Under irrigated and mulched conditions increased level of N predicted increase\
    \ in maize grain and stover yield upto 120 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Whereas\
    \ under un-irrigated mulched conditions highest grain and stover yield was predicted\
    \ at 60 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Maize yield was also simulated at different\
    \ sowing dates and in combination with variable spacings and it was predicted\
    \ that under irrigated condition closer spacing 40 cm \xD7 20 cm at 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ April sowing recorded highest grain and stover yield of maize. Under un-irrigated\
    \ mulched conditions highest grain yield was predicted at 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ April sowing with spacing 65 cm \xD7 20 cm. Soil water balance under simulation\
    \ studies indicated that potential ET was recorded comparatively higher with early\
    \ sowing date than late sowing date under both irrigated un-irrigated mulched\
    \ conditions. Similar trend was recorded with respect to transpiration under both\
    \ irrigated and un-irrigated mulched conditions. Simulated soil evaporation was\
    \ more in wider spacing than closer spacing. Similar trend was recorded with regard\
    \ to simulated run-off. Predicted nitrate content (final) of irrigated soil decreased\
    \ where under un-irrigated mulched conditions 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April\
    \ (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) sowing predicted lowest NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ leaching than later sowing dates. Under un-irrigated mulched conditions leached\
    \ nitrate was nominal. Nitrogen denitrification was comparatively more under un-irrigated\
    \ mulched conditions than irrigated condition. It is concluded that DSSAT v 4.5CERES-Maize\
    \ model is very robust in predicting the growth and yield of maize as influenced\
    \ by agrotechniques and could be used in wider perspective.&lt;/p&gt;"
