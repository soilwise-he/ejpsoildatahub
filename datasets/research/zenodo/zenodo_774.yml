  title: Effect of Turfgrass Establishment on Soil Microbiota Using Illumina Sequencing
  abstract: Soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in ecosystem functioning and the
    maintenance of soil fertility.Many studies have been carried out to assess the
    effects of plant on microorganism communities indifferent environments. However,
    little is known about whether turfgrass establishment affects soil microbial community.
    Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in turfgrass soil and
    vacant land soil were studied by high-throughput sequencing technique, and the
    corresponding analysis of microbial composition were conducted. The results showed
    that the bacteria and fungi in the soil of turfgrass are richer than that of vacant
    land. The difference of soil microbial community atthe genera level is more significant
    than that at phylum level. Among bacteria, a total of one dominantgenus and 91
    non-dominant genera were shared by the two samples. Five dominant genera and 66non-dominant
    genera were present only in sample CP4 (turfgrass soil), and 13 dominant genera
    and17 non-dominant genera only in sample CP0 (vacant land).Among fungi, a total
    of 5 dominant genera and 71 non-dominant genera were shared by the two samples,
    8 dominant genera and 23 non-dominant genera were present only in sample CP4,
    and 6 dominant genera and 20 non-dominant genera only in sample CP0. The results
    also indicated that both dominant and non-dominant microbial populations differed
    greatly in the two samples, as did the overall soil microbial community structure.This
    study provides previously unknown information regarding the impact of turfgrass
    establishment on soil microbial communities and also lays a foundation for further
    investigations into microbiota in turfgrass soil.
