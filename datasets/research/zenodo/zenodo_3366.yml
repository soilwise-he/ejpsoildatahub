  title: Effect of integrated watershed management on vegetation cover, soil organic
    carbon and soil fertility in mid-hills of Nepal
  abstract: This research was objectively carried out to evaluate the effect of integrated
    management on watersheds. Thus, well managed and poorly managed watersheds were
    selected; where samples from three altitudinal ranges, four land use types and
    three consecutive soil depths were taken. Changes in vegetation cover were also
    analysed. The result showed an increase in vegetation cover by 27.82 % in well
    managed, and decrease in vegetation cover by 38.33% in poorly managed watershed
    from 1992 to 2015.  Soil organic carbon was found highest (43.57 t/ha) in shrublands
    of altitudinal range of 1700 -2000 m of well managed, and lowest (3.94 t/ha) in
    shrublands of below 1700m in poorly managed watershed. This paper summarises that
    the integrated watershed management is crucial for increasing organic carbon content
    at the watershed level, as a contribution to climate change mitigation.
