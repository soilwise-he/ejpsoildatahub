  title: The Effect Of Soil Conditions On The Physiological Indices Of Costus Afer
    Ker Gawl
  abstract: The effect of different soil conditions on some physiological indices
    of Costus afer was studied in two locations (Otuoke and Opolo) in Bayelsa State,
    Nigeria. The soils physico-chemical properties as well as mineral elements and
    phytochemical contents in leaf samples were assessed using standard procedure.
    The descending order of mineral elements in location I were, P &gt; Ca &gt; Mg
    &gt; K &gt; C &gt; H &gt; AI &gt;Na &gt; N, while that of location 2 were, P &gt;
    Ca &gt; C &gt; K &gt;Al &gt;H &gt; Mg &gt; Na &gt; N. The contents of calcium,
    magnesium, sodium, potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves of C. afer in
    location I were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than those of location 2, while
    the iron, zinc and lead contents in leaves of the test plant in location 1 were
    relatively higher than that of location 2. There were also marked variations in
    phyto chemical contents in leaves of the test plant between the two locations.
    This study indicates that soil factors have a considerable influence on the mineral
    elements and phytochemical contents of Costus afer.
