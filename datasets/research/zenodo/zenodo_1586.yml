  title: Factors affecting soil invertebrate biodiversity in agroecosystems of the
    Po Plain area (Italy)
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil is a fundamental component of the biosphere, whose properties\
    \ and quality are affected by human activities, such as agriculture. Soil health\
    \ is fundamental for different ecosystem services and soil biota has a crucial\
    \ role in maintaining it. Elucidating how different crops and agricultural practices\
    \ affect soil invertebrates communities is of relevance. In the present study,\
    \ a DNA metabarcoding approach was adopted to evaluate the effects of different\
    \ biotic and abiotic factors, including agricultural practices, on the composition\
    \ and diversity of soil invertebrate communities of different agro-ecosystems\
    \ (Po Plain-Italy). At this aim, the DNA markers and the more effective primers\
    \ in retrieving soil metazoan communities were established. Bulk soil samples\
    \ from different agro-ecosystems (i.e., cornfield, alfalfa, paddy fields, vineyard,\
    \ stable meadow, woodland) were collected and, processed for obtaining\_&lt;em&gt;18S\
    \ rRNA&lt;/em&gt;\_and\_&lt;em&gt;coi&lt;/em&gt;\_sequences (raw reads analyzed\
    \ using QIIME2 and R). Soil physical and chemical parameters were measured for\
    \ each soil sample (e.g., pH, carbon-nitrogen ratio, texture, porosity) and metadata\
    \ on farms management were retrieved.\_&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most efficient primer\
    \ pairs in recovering soil metazoans were M620F/M1260R for 18S rRNA, and mlCOIintF/jgHCO2198R\
    \ for\_&lt;em&gt;coi&lt;/em&gt;\_gene.\_Soil communities resulted dominated by\
    \ Nematoda, Arthropoda, Annelida, Rotifera and Tardigrada. The most diverse invertebrate\
    \ communities have been found in the soil of stable meadows and woodlands, while\
    \ cornfields showed the lowest level of diversity. The diversity of soil invertebrate\
    \ communities (Hill numbers) was positively correlated with the level of porosity\
    \ and carbon-nitrogen ratio, while it was negatively correlated with the phosphate\
    \ abundance. This pattern probably reflects the negative effect of excessive fertilization\
    \ with phosphates on soil fauna, while the abundance of organic matter and microhabitats\
    \ were found to enhance the presence of more complex communities. Other soil properties\
    \ were correlated only with specific taxa (e.g., pH was negatively correlated\
    \ with the diversity of Annelida and Rotifera).&lt;/p&gt;"
