  title: COMPARATIVE EFFECTS OF BREWERY WASTE-BASED COMPOSTS ON SOME SOIL CHEMICAL
    PROPERTIES AND YIELD OF AMARANTHUS CAUDATUS.
  abstract: Composting of brewery waste (spent grains) into organic fertilizers can
    serve the multipurpose of conversion of waste to useful material, reduction of
    air and soil pollution as well as the cost of waste disposal. The research was
    aimed at determining the effects of brewery waste-based composts on some physical
    and chemical properties of the soil and the yield of Amaranth (Amaranthuscaudatus).
    The experiment was conducted at the Organic Vegetable Garden for Teaching and
    Research, Department of Agronomy, University of Ibadan, Ibadan. Treatments used
    were 20 t/ha of spent grain (SG) + Poultry dropping (PD) (1:1 and 2:1; v/v), spent
    grain (SG) + cow dung (CD) (1:1 and 2:1; v/v), spent grain (SG) alone (100% SG)
    and control (un-amended soil). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design (RCBD) with four replications. The data collected were subjected
    to analysis of variance and means separated using Fisher?s least significant difference
    (LSD). The spent grains plus poultry droppings performed better than the spent
    grains plus cow dung in the release of organic matter, P, N, K, Na and Ca into
    the soil after the first and residual planting. All the treatments reduced the
    exchangeable acidity when compared with the control. Soils treated with spent
    grains plus poultry droppings (1:1) gave the highest values of organic carbon
    of 33.0 and 31.0 g/kg) and nitrogen of 2.98 and 2.91 g/kg respectively after the
    main and residual trials. The highest yield values were obtained in the spent
    grains plus poultry droppings (1:1) and the least in the control (un-amended)
    in both in both first (treatment) and second (residual) planting. In conclusion,
    the use of brewery waste-based composts for soil amendment added value to the
    improvement of the soil nutrient status.
