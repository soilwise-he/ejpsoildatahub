  title: Isolation and Identification of Cellulolytic Bacteria from Wood Industry
    Soil in Kancheepuram, Chennai
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cellulose degradation is carried out by a large number
    of microorganisms with only a limited population of these organisms producing
    a substantial amount of cellulase capable of complete hydrolysis of cellulose;
    cellulolytic bacteria are one of the main cellulase-producing microorganisms.
    A total of 22 bacterial strains from 3 different wood industries in Chennai was
    isolated on agar plates containing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the substrate,
    two strains showed hydrolyzing zones after congo red staining and microscopic
    examination of the isolates revealed Gram-positive cocci exhibiting pink colored
    cells; using 16S rRNA sequence, phylogenetic analysis was performed with BLAST
    program to determine the evolutionary relationship and molecular identification
    indicated that 2 strains (ABTRI-1 and ABTRI-2) exhibit 99% similarities to Oceanobacillus
    profundus on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Identification of bacterial
    species capable of cellulose degradation is becoming an important aspect in the
    mass production of cellulase enzymes that have applications in textile industries,
    food industries as well as biomedical fields.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
