  title: Soil N transformation rates protocol
  abstract: "Soil nitrogen transformation rates (potential net N transformation, mineralization,\
    \ ammonification, nitrification and depolymerisation) (Schimel & Bennett, 2004)\
    \ are measured by determination of the total K2SO4 or KCl extractable nitrogen\
    \ (TAN), the available mineral N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) and the dissolved organic\
    \ N (DON) forms before and after a soil incubation in the laboratory at 80% of\
    \ water holding capacity (WHC) and 30\xB0C for 14 days (Allen, Grimshaw & Rowland\
    \ 1986),\_and extracted with K2SO4 0.5M or KCl 1M in a 1:10 ratio.\_ The incubation,\
    \ extraction and the colorimetric analyses of DON, NH4+-N and NO3-N in the soil\xB4\
    s extract are made following the procedure describe below. The amount of N forms\
    \ in the soils is calculated using a linear calibration curve with standards and\
    \ expressed as mgr N kg-1 soil and rates are expressed as mgr N kg-1 soil day-1.\_"
