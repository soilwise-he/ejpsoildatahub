  title: Numerical Investigation of Soft Clayey Soil Improved by Soil-Cement Columns
    under Harmonic Load
  abstract: Deep soil mixing is one of the improvement methods in geotechnical engineering
    which is widely used in soft soils. This article investigates the consolidation
    behavior of a soft clay soil which is improved by soil-cement column (SCC) by
    numerical modeling using Plaxis2D program. This behavior is simulated under vertical
    static and cyclic load which is applied on the soil surface. The static load problem
    is the simulation of a physical model test in an axisymmetric condition which
    uses a single SCC in the model center. The results of numerical modeling consist
    of settlement of soft soil composite, stress on soft soil and column, and excessive
    pore water pressure in the soil show a good correspondence with the test results.
    The response of soft soil composite to the cyclic load in vertical direction also
    compared with the static results. Also the effects of two variables namely the
    cement content used in a SCC and the area ratio (the ratio of the diameter of
    SCC to the diameter of composite soil model, a) is investigated. The results show
    that the stress on the column with the higher value of a, is lesser compared with
    the stress on other columns. Different rate of consolidation and excessive pore
    pressure distribution is observed in cyclic load problem. Also comparing the results
    of settlement of soil shows higher compressibility in the cyclic load problem.
