  title: CREATION OF FERTILE SOIL MIXTURES USING SOIL MODIFIERS BASED ON HUMIC SUBSTANCES
  abstract: "Effectiveness of humic-based natural biopolymers from peat and coal (\u201C\
    Peatgel\u201D and \u201CCoalgel\u201D) used as soil modifiers (SM) to create fertile\
    \ artificial soils is evaluated. The effect of increasing rates of SM (0, 3, 5,\
    \ 7, 9, 13 and 15%) on the agrochemical and hydrophysical soil properties and\
    \ wheat plants productivity has been studied in pot experiment. It is shown that\
    \ both GM in the increasing rates positively affect soil agrochemical parameters..\
    \ Both SM drastically increase the proportion of medium and large soil aggregates,\
    \ whereas the share of fine particles decreased. The most significant changes\
    \ were observed when the content of soil organic matter achieved 6 % and higher.\
    \ For artificial soils based on \u201CPeatgel\u201D, the optimal proportion of\
    \ GM was 13-15%, and for the ones based on \u201CCoalgel\u201D it was 7-13%."
