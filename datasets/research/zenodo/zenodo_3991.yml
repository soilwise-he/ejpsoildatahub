  title: The Effect of Treatment Sewage Sludge Applied to the Vetch + Barley Mixture
    on Soil Heavy Metal Content
  abstract: Abstract This study was conducted in the trial fields of Ege University
    Faculty of Agriculture in Bornova in 2015 and 2016 in order to determine the effect
    of treated sewage sludge (SST) applied to vetch + barley mixture on the heavy
    metal content of the soil. The study was carried out in a randomized complete
    block design with four replications and 1, 2 and 3 t /da of sewage sludge were
    applied in addition to control and mineral fertilizer applications. In the study
    the heavy metals of soil such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), nickel
    (Ni), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and chromium (Cr) contents were investigated. As
    a result of the research, although slight increases were found in Cu, Mn, Ni,
    Zn, Cd contents, these increases were observed to be below the limit values of
    the regulation of the use of sewage sludge in agriculture. Applications had no
    significant effect on available K and available Mn. When the results are according
    to the soil analysis results and heavy metal amounts from the sewage sludge, it
    is concluded that 2 t da-1 sewage sludge can be used in vetch + barley mixtures.
