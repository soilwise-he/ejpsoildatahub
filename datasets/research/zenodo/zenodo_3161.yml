  title: Chromic acid oxidation of oxalic acid catalysed by manganese(II) - Kinetic
    method of estimation of manganese(II) and water soluble and extractable manganese
    in soil
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, S.R.V.B.S.J.B.M.R. College, Peddapuram-533 437.
    East Godavari Dt., Andhra Pradesh. India <em>Manuscript received 22 February 2008.
    accepted 15 April 2008</em> The catalytic effect of manganese(II) on the oxidation
    of oxalic acid by chromic acid has been pressed into use for its determination.
    A simple kinetic method has been developed using fixed time and iodometric procedures.
    The method is found to be suitable for the estimation of water soluble and exchangeable
    manganese in soil and the results have been compared with those of Atomic Absorption
    Spectrophotometer (<strong>AAS</strong>).
