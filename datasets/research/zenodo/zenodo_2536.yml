  title: Guidelines and a supporting toolbox for parameterising key soil hydraulic
    properties in hydrological studies and broader integrated modelling
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Information on soil hydraulic properties (e.g. soil moisture
    pressure relationships and hydraulic conductivity) is valuable for a wide range
    of disciplines including hydrology, ecology, environmental management and agriculture.
    However, this information is often not readily available as direct measurements
    are costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, as more complex representations of
    soils are being built into environmental models, users and developers often require
    sound hydraulic property information, while having limited access to specialist
    knowledge. Although indirect methods have been developed to obtain soil hydraulic
    properties from easily measurable or readily available soil properties via pedo-transfer
    functions (PTFs), few articles provide guidance for obtaining soil hydraulic properties
    over a wide range of geoclimatic and regional data availability contexts. The
    aim of this study is, therefore, to develop guidelines and an associated spatially
    referenced toolbox, NB_PTFs, to speed the process of acquiring sensible soil hydraulic
    properties for different geoclimatic and data-rich/sparse regions. The guide compiles
    available information about soil hydraulic properties, as well as a large number
    (151) of PTFs, not collated in any other guidance to date. NB_PTFs is an open-source
    ArcGIS toolbox which allows users to quickly get values, graphs and spatial distributions
    of soil hydraulic properties. The soil hydraulic properties, obtained using the
    guide and the toolbox, can be used as inputs for various models amongst other
    purposes. To demonstrate the use of the guidelines and the toolbox in different
    geoclimatic and data-availability contexts, the paper presents two case studies:
    the Vietnamese Mekong Delta and New Zealand Hurunui catchment. The Vietnamese
    Mekong Delta shows the use of these guidelines in a tropical, flat location with
    limited information on soil physical, chemical and hydraulic properties. The Hurunui
    catchment represents a case study for a semi-arid and hilly area in an area with
    detailed soil information.&lt;/p&gt;'
