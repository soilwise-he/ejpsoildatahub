  title: Finite Element Analysis Of Raft Foundation On Various Soil Types Under Earthquake
    Loading
  abstract: The design of shallow foundations to withstand different dynamic loads
    has given considerable attention in recent years. Dynamic loads may be due to
    the earthquakes, pile driving, blasting, water waves, and machine vibrations.
    But, predicting the behavior of shallow foundations during earthquakes remains
    a difficult task for geotechnical engineers. A database for dynamic and static
    parameters for different soils in seismic active zones in Iraq is prepared which
    has been collected from geophysical and geotechnical investigation works. Then,
    analysis of a typical 3-D soil-raft foundation system under earthquake loading
    is carried out using the database. And a parametric study has been carried out
    taking into consideration the influence of some parameters on the dynamic behavior
    of the raft foundation, such as raft stiffness, damping ratio as well as the influence
    of the earthquake acceleration-time records. The results of the parametric study
    show that the settlement caused by the earthquake can be decreased by about 72%
    with increasing the thickness from 0.5 m to 1.5 m. But, it has been noticed that
    reduction in the maximum bending moment by about 82% was predicted by decreasing
    the raft thickness from 1.5 m to 0.5 m in all sites model. Also, it has been observed
    that the maximum lateral displacement, the maximum vertical settlement and the
    maximum bending moment for damping ratio 0% is about 14%, 20%, and 18% higher
    than that for damping ratio 7.5%, respectively for all sites model.
