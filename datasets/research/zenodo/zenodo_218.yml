  title: METHODS OF SOIL SLOP STABILITY ANALYSIS
  abstract: Slope failure is one of the major geological phenomenon that happen due
    to the topography and weather conditions which cause a wide range of ground movements
    which needed engineers to plan in order to avoid its risk on human lives and properties
    by an appropriate stabilizing method. The analysis of slope stability has received
    widely attention now days because of its practical importance. To provide steepest
    slops which are stable and safe various investigations are ongoing. Stability
    is determined by the balance of shear stress and shear strength. If the forces
    available to resist movement are greater than the forces driving movement, the
    slope is considered stable.
