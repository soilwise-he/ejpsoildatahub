  title: Effect of Soil Behavior Model on Drilling Response of Anchor-reinforced Excavation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The reinforced elements such as nailing and anchor have been
    widely used for the stability of excavation and trench because of not taking up
    a large space, improved soil properties by injection, greater safety and possibility
    of being used as permanent retaining structure. Due to the complex behavior of
    reinforced excavation, the stability analysis of reinforced excavation is performed
    by finite element method. Some factors such as boundary interval, dimensions and
    type of elements, and type of behavior model of materials affect the numerical
    results. Due to the complex behavior of the soil stress-strain, influence from
    stress path and loading history, and existence of groundwater, different behavior
    models have been proposed to simulate the materials. In this study, the effect
    of soil behavior model on the response of anchored excavation was investigated.
    For this purpose, using the finite element method in the plane strain conditions,
    the excavation reinforced with anchorage system was simulated for different geometrical
    conditions, and the results of the excavation response were compared for the Mohr-Coulomb,
    Drucker-Prager, and modified Cam-Clay behavior models. In the shallow excavation,
    it was found that the Mohr-Coulomb behavior model has the least displacement and
    the Drucker-Prager behavior model has the largest lateral displacement. The Drucker-Prager
    behavior model should be considered as a reliable criterion for the design and
    control of the excavation because of the greater results regarding the lateral
    displacement of excavation and generally, excavation deformation.&lt;/p&gt;'
