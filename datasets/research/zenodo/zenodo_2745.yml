  title: Particle-based model shows complex rearrangement of tissue mechanical properties
    are needed for roots to grow in hard soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;When exposed to increased mechanical resistance from the soil, plant
    roots display non-linear growth responses that cannot be solely explained by mechanical
    principles. Here, we aim to investigate how changes in tissue mechanical properties
    are biologically regulated in response to soil strength. A particle-based model
    was developed to solve root-soil mechanical interactions at the cellular scale,
    and a detailed numerical study explored factors that affect root responses to
    soil resistance. Results showed how softening of root tissues at the tip may contribute
    to root responses to soil impedance, a mechanism likely linked to soil cavity
    expansion. The model also predicted the shortening and decreased anisotropy of
    the zone where growth occurs, which may improve the mechanical stability of the
    root against axial forces. The study demonstrates the potential of advanced modeling
    tools to help identify traits that confer plant resistance to abiotic stress.
