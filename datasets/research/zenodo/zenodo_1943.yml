  title: Influence of agricultural residues on some physical parameters of the soil
    fertility under eggplant cultivation
  abstract: The loss of physical soil fertility reduces the mineral potential of soils
    each year with loss of agricultural yields in West Africa. As a solution, soil
    amendment based on animal waste is often considered while agricultural residues
    are regularly destroyed or subjected to animals. In addition, agro-industries
    and sawmills dump large quantities of waste into the environment of cities. The
    present study aimed to evaluate the effects of carbonized rice husk and sawdust
    on some physical parameters of a soil in eggplant production. The effect of fourteen
    (14) treatments based on carbonized rice husk and sawdust, with or without addition
    of chicken droppings, was tested under eggplant culture in the presence of two
    controls, with and without the addition of droppings. Particle size, permeability
    and humidity were determined after each crop cycle. In addition, the evolution
    of organic matter was evaluated in parallel. The results showed a textural improvement
    of the soil in relation to the variation of permeability and humidity at saturation
    and field capacity under the effect of agricultural substrates. The combination
    of rice husk, sawdust and chicken droppings allowed better soil moisture control.
    The 67% sawdust-33% rice husk composite with basic manure of 3 t.ha-1 of chicken
    droppings stood out from the others. In a context of climate change where rains
    are scarce, the data indicate that carbonized rice husks, carbonized sawdust and
    chicken droppings are residues to be valued in the conservation management of
    organic matter and agricultural soilwater.
