  title: Behavior of Soil Subgrade Strength with Saturation
  abstract: The traffic volume counts to be carried and the strength of the subgrade
    soil are used to design the different levels of pavement that must be placed over
    it. The strength of the subgrade is commonly expressed as a ratio known as the
    California Bearing Ratio, abbreviated as CBR. When the subgrade is weaker, thicker
    layers are required, whereas when the subgrade is stronger, thinner layers are
    sufficient. When we can understand how the strength of these soils is affected
    by variations in saturation, it will be much easier to design and maintain stronger
    structures. CBR resistance values for soils utilized in the subgrademay vary to
    a greater extent due to the saturation of the subgrade. Hence, throughout this
    study,variation in the soaking degreehas been tried and in turn the saturation
    level in twosoiltypes and engineering properties of soils and CBR at different
    levels of saturation are studied. The engineering properties that wereevaluated
    after the soaking of three days were worst and consideringfine-grained soils,
    it is found to be same after the end of day 4.
