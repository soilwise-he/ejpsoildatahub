  title: Red alder (Alnus rubra) alters community-level soil microbial function in
    conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-fixing tree species have been shown to improve site
    fertility and increase N transformation rates, but the influence of N-fixing plants
    on the soil microbial community as a whole is largely unknown. We used patterns
    of individual carbon-source utilization and enzyme activities to assess the relative
    effects of N-fixing red alder on the soil microbial community in three adjacent
    stands (pure conifer, mixed alder-conifer, and pure alder) of a highly productive
    coastal Oregon forest where the density of red alder has been experimentally manipulated
    for over 65 years. Two major patterns were revealed: (1) bacterial and fungal
    carbon-source utilization patterns in soil from pure conifer stands were significantly
    different from both pure alder soils and mixed conifer-alder soils, while there
    was no difference in substrate utilization patterns between soils from the mixed
    alder-conifer and pure alder stands; and (2) the activities of nine extracellular
    enzymes involved in ligno-cellulose degradation and the mineralization of organic
    nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate compounds were all significantly greater in pure
    alder soils compared to either pure conifer or mixed conifer-alder soils. Our
    results show that, in addition to an overall increase in soil fertility, microbial
    biomass, and microbial activity, the presence of N-fixing red alder significantly
    alters the physiological profile of the microbial community-even in an ecosystem
    already of high N status.&lt;/p&gt;'
