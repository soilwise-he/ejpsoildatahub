  title: "Soil organisms as an essential element of a monitoring plan to identify\
    \ the effects of GMO cultivation. Requirements \u2013 Methodology \u2013 Standardisation"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;After a release of genetically modified organisms, monitoring
    of potential adverse effects on the environment is mandatory. The protocol used
    for monitoring should be previously tested in practical studies and must be standardised.
    Moreover, sampling methods and the evaluation of results must meet current scientific
    and technical standards. Due to their particular role in maintaining soil quality
    and in a multitude of ecological processes in agro-ecosystems, soil organisms
    belong to those groups for which VDI guidelines are being developed. The guideline
    4331 Part 1 describes fundamental criteria for the selection and sampling of soil
    organisms for GMO monitoring and gives guidance for sampling design, sampling
    strategy and statistical evaluation. In the guideline three approaches are followed:
    (1) a compilation of previously known effects and exposure pathways, (2) a documentation
    of ecological functions of soil organisms (ecosystem services) as well as (3)
    a description of characteristic species compositions in the soil. The aim was
    to develop a selection matrix that helps to choose the appropriate animal groups
    to be sampled. Besides the habitat type and the ecological relevance, the selection
    matrix also considers the suitability of animal groups in terms of practical issues
    and, in specific cases, anticipated effects. Further parts of the guideline 4331
    will describe sampling methods for relevant soil animal groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
