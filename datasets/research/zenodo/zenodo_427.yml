  title: New pedotransfer approaches to predict soil bulk density using WoSIS soil
    data and environmental covariates in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems
  abstract: "For the estimation of the soil organic carbon stocks, bulk density (BD)\
    \ is a fundamental parameter but measured data are usually not available especially\
    \ when dealing with legacy soil data. It is possible to estimate BD by applying\
    \ pedotransfer function (PTF). We applied different estimation methods with the\
    \ aim to define a suitable PTF for BD of arable land for the Mediterranean Basin,\
    \ which has peculiar climate features that may influence the soil carbon sequestration.\
    \ To improve the existing BD estimation methods, we used a set of public climatic\
    \ and topographic data along with the soil texture and organic carbon data. The\
    \ present work consisted of the following steps: i) development of three PTFs\
    \ models separately for top (0\u20130.4 m) and subsoil (0.4\u20131.2 m), ii) a\
    \ 10-fold cross-validation, iii) model transferability using an external dataset\
    \ derived from published data. The development of the new PTFs was based on the\
    \ training dataset consisting of World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) soil profile\
    \ data, climatic data from WorldClim at 1 km spatial resolution and Shuttle Radar\
    \ Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model at 30 m spatial resolution.\
    \ The three PTFs models were developed using: Multiple Linear Regression stepwise\
    \ (MLR-S), Multiple Linear Regression backward stepwise (MLR-BS), and Artificial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN). The predictions of the newly developed PTFs were compared\
    \ with the BD calculated using the PTF proposed by Manrique and Jones (MJ) and\
    \ the modelled BD derived from the global SoilGrids dataset. For the topsoil training\
    \ dataset (<em>N</em> = 129), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN had a R<sup>2</sup> 0.35,\
    \ 0.58 and 0.86, respectively. For the model transferability, the three PTFs applied\
    \ to the external topsoil dataset (<em>N</em> = 59), achieved R<sup>2</sup> values\
    \ of 0.06, 0.03 and 0.41. For the subsoil training dataset (<em>N</em> = 180),\
    \ MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN the R<sup>2</sup> values were 0.36, 0.46 and 0.83, respectively.\
    \ When applied to the external subsoil dataset (<em>N</em> = 29), the R<sup>2</sup>\
    \ values were 0.05, 0.06 and 0.41. The cross-validation for both top and subsoil\
    \ dataset, resulted in an intermediate performance compared to calibration and\
    \ validation with the external dataset. The new ANN PTF outperformed MLR-S, MLR-BS,\
    \ MJ and SoilGrids approaches for estimating BD. Further improvements may be achieved\
    \ by additionally considering the time of sampling, agricultural soil management\
    \ and cultivation practices in predictive models."
