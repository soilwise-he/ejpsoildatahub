  title: Soil fertilizer as an antropogenic factor of the increase potential in biological
    fixation of nitrogen
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An application of mineral fertilizers is considered the main
    method of provision of agriculture plants with nitrogen. However, the plant need
    for nitrogen can&rsquo;t be always wholly satisfied because of the energetic crisis
    and expensiveness of nitrogen fertilizers. In this regard, biological nitrogen
    is of great importance. Use of the biological nitrogen creates a favourable background
    for agriculture and allows to spend economically mineral fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;'
