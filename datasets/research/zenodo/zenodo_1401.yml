  title: Estimation of soil enzyme activity with respect to decomposition of leaf
    litter types
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> The measurement of enzyme activities give an\
    \ index of the extent of specific biochemical processes in soil and in many situations\
    \ acts as an indicator of soil fertility. Historical evidences show that this\
    \ area was once a thick forest but widespread forest denudation by human settlements\
    \ form early nineteenth century had converted the entire area barren up to the\
    \ line of horizon. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect\
    \ of litter types of the above-mentioned four tree species on edaphic properties\
    \ of tropical deciduous afforested ecosystem in Srisailam reserve forest. The\
    \ present climatic record of the local meteorological station shows average monthly\
    \ temperature of 26.10C in 2010 (range 10.90C in January to 38.40 C in May), 26.40C\
    \ in 2011 (range 12.40C in January to 37.70C in June), total annual rainfall of\
    \ 1516.7 mm in 2010 and 1381.5 mm in 2011, and mean monthly relative humidity\
    \ 78.1% in 2010 and 77.8% in 2011. The changes in enzyme activities were clearly\
    \ evident with respect to leaf litter types and between winter, summer and rainy\
    \ Seasons. Among different enzymes the activities of invertase, protease and acid\
    \ phosphatase were higher than that of amylase, cellulase and dehydrogenase in\
    \ all the sites. The enzyme activity of all the sites, except Shorea showed equally\
    \ high levels during rainy season. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Srisailam, Invertase,\
