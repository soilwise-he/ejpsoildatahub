  title: ASSESMENT OF THE RAILWAY INFLUENCE ON THE HEAVY METAL ACCUMULATION IN SOIL
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The scientific paper
    aims at analyzing the current state of the railway infrastructure soil contamination
    with heavy metals (HM), namely, the three stations of Prydniprovska railway: Kamianske-Pasazhyrske,
    Zaporizhzhia-Kamianske and Trytuzna.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology.&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The
    research object is the soil of the above mentioned railway stations, the research
    subject is the total content of HM. Sampling was carried out every 15 m between
    and outside both rails up to the end of railway ties. The total area of the investigated
    sites is 600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total form of Fe, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni,
    Cd and Mn concentration was determined by the atomic absorption spectrometry method.
    The obtained data were compared with the background concentration of HM for Dnipropetrovsk
    oblast and the results of analyzing the reference control located at a distance
    of 250 m from the railway stations.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Findings.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;It
    is found out that rail transport is a source of HM emission into soil. The findings
    indicate that the soil state of the Kamianske-Pasazhyrske station corresponds
    to a low ecological risk and a low degree of pollution, since the station is a
    passenger one only and pollution occurs mostly due to&nbsp;and that of the pantograph
    and overhead system, as well as the pesticide use. The soil contamination of the&nbsp;Zaporizhzhia-Kamianske
    station is characterized by a considerable potential environmental risk and a
    very high degree of pollution. This station is a cargo-passenger one, and this
    pollution level is mainly due to loading and unloading processes. The soil of
    the Trytuzna station is characterized by an average potential ecological risk
    and a moderate degree of pollution. Although this station is mainly used for the
    freight trains reformation, but due to the transportation of large volumes of
    bulk ore cargoes HM fall into soil. Besides, the station is not electrified. Recommendations
    for assessment of the soil pollution levels are given.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Originality.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;For
    the first time the potential ecological risk of soil contamination was determined
    on the basis of the physical and chemical analysis of the HM content in the soil
    of the above-mentioned stations.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Practical value.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The
    results of the study can be used as a justification of the reasonability of introducing
    the environmental monitoring programs for the railway land, the environmental
    protection measures for the soil treatment from HM, correcting the railway exclusion
    zone, as well as protection of adjacent territories from the propagation and accumulation
    of the mentioned pollutants. The necessity and urgency of the constant control
    of the HM content in the railway soil and the relevance of the research continuation
    in this scientific direction are confirmed on the basis of the received data.&lt;/p&gt;'
