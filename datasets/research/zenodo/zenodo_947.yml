  title: 'Comparative Study of Different Sewage Farming on Soil Quality: A Review'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Sewage Sludge contains high amount of nutrients in the form
    of wastewater. This wastewater is treated in Sewage treatment plant and separation
    of Sludge from wastewater is taken out using various type of technology. The sludge
    separated from wastewater is further treated in sludge treatment unit and removal
    of maximum amount of water is done using various equipment. The treated water
    is reused for various purposes or discharge into river bodies and the sludge after
    treatment are sending to disposal site. This study focuses on the utilization
    of this sewage sludge as a fertilizer and comparison of this sludge with chemical
    fertilizer. The content of nutrient in sewage shows significant results on application
    with various plants and discussed the effect of sewage farming on soil quality.
