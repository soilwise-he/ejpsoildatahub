  title: Analytical Indicators Research Of Water And Soil Samples In The Territory
    Of Karmanovskaya Gres (Neftekamsk, Bashkortostan)
  abstract: "The aim of this work is the study of the analytical performance of samples\
    \ of water and soil on the territory of Karmanovskaya GRES city of Neftekamsk\
    \ of the Republic of Bashkortostan.\n\nIn the article the organoleptic evaluation\
    \ of the quality of the water samples and the results of investigations of physical-chemical\
    \ indicators: total salinity, hardness, pH and radon. Analysis of water for metal\
    \ content was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The radon content was\
    \ measured with a radiometer Alford. The article also presents a study of soil\
    \ samples from the territory of Karmanovskaya GRES. The analysis of the content\
    \ of movable forms of metals, petroleum, volatile phenols and other indicators.\
    \ Determination of mobile forms of metals was conducted by atomic absorption method\
    \ M-MVI-80-2008. Study of petroleum products was carried out using fluorescence.\
    \ The results of the study of organoleptic characteristics of water samples indicate\
    \ the absence of \u201Cbloom\u201D and \u201Cattenuation of water\u201D. Values\
    \ of mass concentrations of metals in all water samples do not reach the maximum\
    \ permissible concentrations. The concentrations of heavy metals in soil sample\
    \ within the MPC. However, there is a slight increase in the concentration of\
    \ copper and manganese, which is probably connected with their presence in parent\
    \ rocks.\n\nAccording to the research data of water samples, the authors have\
    \ shown that Karmanovskaya GRES is not a source of pollution, as indicators of\
    \ all chemical values were determined in water samples do not exceed the Mac values,\
    \ according to SanPiN 2.1.4.107401. The numerical values of the soils, in General,\
    \ do not exceed standards and have no adverse effects on the environment. The\
    \ conclusion that the territory of Karmanovskaya SDPP, not subjected to anthropogenic\
    \ influence."
