  title: 'Nanoparticles in Biosolids: Effect on Soil Health and Crop Growth'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles are becoming popular from their use in medicine
    for therapy, diagnostics and imaging, in pharmacy for drug delivery, to its use
    in electronics, engineering and manufacturing industries. This wide application
    has increased their presence in the environment especially in wastewater from
    municipal and industrial sources. They end up in the fi nal product; biosolids
    which are treated sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. Due to limited
    space in landfi lls and cost effectiveness, biosolids are predominantly disposed
    in land applications as organic fertilizer for crop production or land reclamation.
    Nanoparticles have been detected in wastewater and biosolids raising concerns
    about their effect on soil health and crop growth. While a large number of studies
    have been conducted on effect of nanoparticles on seed germination and plant growth,
    few studies have been carried out using biosolids. The sole effect of nanoparticles
    may be different from when it&rsquo;s present in biosolids due to reaction with
    some components in biosolids. Hence more work is needed in this area to provide
    direction for regulation of biosolids. Studies have reported both positive and
    negative effects of nanoparticles on plant growth showing that it depends on plant
    species, type of nanoparticle, and dose of nanoparticle and method of application.
    There is also very little work on effect of nanoparticles on soil health. Most
    of the work done has shown the antimicrobial effect of some nanoparticles which
    could affect nutrient release from the organic matter fraction in the soil and
    disrupt some plant-microbe relationships that promote soil fertility. Although
    nanoparticles have proved benefi cial in many aspects of life, they need to be
    monitored due to their increasing use in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;'
