  title: Intercropping in rainfed Mediterranean olive groves contributes to improving
    soil quality and soil organic carbon storage
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Given the current degradation problems that Mediterranean soils\
    \ endure, the implementation of alley cropping in olive orchards has been suggested\
    \ as a sustainable strategy to increase agricultural productivity and improve\
    \ carbon storage and soil fertility. Therefore, the objective of this study was\
    \ to evaluate in the short term (3 years) the effect of alley cropping with minimum\
    \ tillage versus conventional tillage in a traditional rainfed olive grove on\
    \ soil organic carbon, total nitrogen concentrations, and stocks. Changes in soil\
    \ quality through a stratification index, and the success of the 4\u2030 strategy\
    \ in these soils with this type of management were also evaluated. Three intercropping\
    \ strategies were tested: &lt;i&gt;Crocus sativus&lt;/i&gt; (D-S), &lt;i&gt;Vicia\
    \ sativa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Avena sativa&lt;/i&gt; in rotation (D-O), and\
    \ &lt;i&gt;Lavandula x intermedia&lt;/i&gt; (D-L), all with minimum tillage versus\
    \ olive with conventional tillage without intercropping, which was used as a control.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intercropping\
    \ increased soil organic carbon in topsoil (0\u201310 cm) by 41.1, 28.5, and 30.5%\
    \ for D-S, D-O, and D-L, respectively, compared to conventional tillage. At a\
    \ depth of 10\u201330 cm, the soil organic carbon and the soil organic carbon\
    \ stock increased slightly, although significant differences were found only in\
    \ D-L. In the diversified plots, total nitrogen did not vary. However, total nitrogen\
    \ increased in olive with conventional tillage due to fertilisation. Concerning\
    \ soil quality, no significant differences were observed when evaluating the soil\
    \ carbon and nitrogen stratification index in any of the treatments. However,\
    \ the implementation of intercropping reached the objectives set by the&nbsp;4\u2030\
    &lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;initiative in these soils with an increase\
    \ in soil carbon per hectare and per year of 80, 87.4, and 86.4% for D-S, D-O,\
    \ and D-L, respectively. Therefore, based on these results, in the short term,\
    \ intercropping treatment enhances carbon storage in these soils, effectively\
    \ achieving the objectives of the 4\u2030 initiative. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
