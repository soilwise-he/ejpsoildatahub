  title: Effect Of Nacl Salinity In Genotypic Variation Of Maize (Zea Mays L.) During
    Early Growth Stage In Low Land Soil Of Ethiopia
  abstract: Salt stress is the main problem during crop production at the agricultural
    land. This study was conducted to screen the maize genotypes for salt tolerance
    under salt stress condition using agronomical traits. The pot experimental treatments
    were used four NaCl salinity levels (0, 80, 160 and 240 mM) and nine maize genotypes
    (61006, Mal-1, Mal.hybrid, 215065, MHQ, 207346, 227235, M-130 and 61036). It was
    arranged in factorial Complete Randomize Design with three replicates. Data was
    analyzed using SAS, SPSS and Minitab-6 statistical software and means were separated
    by least significance difference (LSD). Eight agronomic traits (shoot length,
    root length, shoot fresh weight, root fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root dry
    weight, seedling root reduction and seedling shoot reduction) were measured. The
    ANOVA for treatments of genotypes and their interaction was found to be highly
    significant (p&lt;0.05) with regard to root fresh weight (RFW), shoot fresh weight
    (SHFW), root dry weight (RDW), shoot dry weight (SHDW) and seedling root reduction
    (SRR). Genotypes MHQ, 207346 and Mal.hybrid were found in a highly salt tolerant
    during seedling growth stage. However, genotypes 227235 and 61006 were salt sensitive,
    and the rest genotypes were intermediate in their salt tolerance. The correlation
    analysis showed a highly positive significant correlation between shoot length
    (SHL) and shoot fresh weight (SHFW). Cluster analysis was carried out to set genotypes
    into different groups. The agronomical traits method was an effective, easy and
    affordable technique for assessment of salt-tolerant genotypes which will be useful
    for plant breeders.
