  title: Transition to agroforestry significantly improves soil quality for increased
    food production and food security in the terrace ecosystem of Bangladesh
  abstract: "The study was aimed to evaluate soil chemical properties in jackfruit\
    \ based multistoried agroforestry system in the central terrace ecosystem of Bangladesh.\
    \ The study was conducted at a farmer\u2019s field under Belabo upazila of Narsingdi\
    \ district of Bangladesh from September, 2011 to January, 2014. Jackfruit trees\
    \ were kept as upperstorey; papaya, lemon, mandarin and sweet orange were at middlestorey\
    \ and seasonal vegetables such as eggplant, bottle gourd and ash gourd were grown\
    \ as lowerstorey crops.The experiment was conducted in a Randomized Complete Block\
    \ Design (RCBD) with three replications. There were five treatments covering agroforestry\
    \ with four orientations and sole cropping (jackfruit trees). Positive changes\
    \ of the chemical properties of top soil layer were observed in agroforestry over\
    \ sole cropping (jackfruit trees). Soil pH (4.62), total nitrogen (0.081%), organic\
    \ carbon (0.61%), organic matter (1.05%), phosphorus (4.23 ppm), Sulphur (10.17\
    \ ppm), calcium (2.27 meq/100g), magnesium (0.46 meq/100g) and potassium (0.52\
    \ meq/100g) were found higher in agroforestry systems than that of sole cropping\
    \ (jackfruit trees). Results revealed that soils in the agroforestry systems tuned\
    \ to more fertile than soil in the sole cropping (jackfruit trees). The results\
    \ clearly indicated that agroforestry systems are more suitable to build up soil\
    \ fertility than the sole cropping (jackfruit trees)."
