  title: The Effect of N Fertilizer Application Timing on Wheat Yield on Chernozem
    Soil
  abstract: "The challenges of the global food supply and environment conservation\
    \ require ongoing scientific observations of soil-to-plant and plant-to-environment\
    \ interactions with the aim of improving agriculture resource management. This\
    \ study included observations of winter wheat yield and biomass of four varieties\
    \ over three consecutive growing seasons and four site-year cases to assess the\
    \ effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization rate and time of application on grain\
    \ yield and biomass. For different wheat varieties, the full factorial design\
    \ was performed, where factorial combinations of year, location, fall and spring\
    \ N applications were laid out in a randomized complete block design. The N rate\
    \ significantly influenced grain yield and biomass production efficiency. The\
    \ time of N application had a highly significant effect on grain yield, biomass\
    \ and NUE traits. The N rate of 120 kg ha<sup>\u22121</sup> was recognized as\
    \ a breakpoint over which the grain yield and biomass showed a downtrend. N application\
    \ in the fall had a significantly higher impact on grain yield and biomass compared\
    \ to spring N application. The major contribution of wheat variability production\
    \ belongs to seasonal climate circumstances (&lt;85%) and consequential intrinsic\
    \ soil properties. The average difference of grain yield between varieties was\
    \ 15.75%, and 12% of biomass, respectively."
