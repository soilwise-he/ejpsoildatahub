  title: Effects of Solubilised Orange Peels on the Occurrence of some Fungal Soil-borne
    Pathogens of Zea mays (L.)
  abstract: This work examined the use of <em>Trichoderma</em> solubilised orange
    peel to inhibit the occurrence and growth of some fungal pathogens associated
    with soil-borne diseases of maize (<em>Zea mays)</em>. The study was conducted
    in the Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology demonstration plot, Rivers
    State University, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. <em>Trichoderma </em>species were isolated
    from contaminated mushroom substrates at Dilomat Farms and Services Limited, Rivers
    State University. Sweet orange (<em>Ci</em><em>trus sinensis</em>) peels were
    collected from a local market at the Port Harcourt Metropolis, air-dried for seven
    days and ground to powder. The treatments were <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em>+<em>orange
    peel</em>, <em>T. koningii</em>+<em>orange peel</em>, <em>orange peels only, T.
    harzianum only, T. koningii only,</em> <em>T. harzianum</em>+<em>T. koningii </em>and
    Soil only. The layout was a completely randomized design with three replications
    and concentrations at 5g/15ml, 10g/15ml and 15g/15ml which were applied to the
    soil at the interval of two weeks for 10 weeks. <em>Pythium spp, Fusarium spp,
    Rhizoctona spp</em> and <em>Phytopthora spp</em> were isolated and identified
    at three weeks and ten weeks of treatments. Average number of individual colonies
    of soil mycoflora in the various treatments at the three concentration levels
    varied relatively and the total number and frequency of occurrence decreased as
    the number of weeks of treatments increased. There was relatively high occurrence
    of soil-borne pathogens of maize at 5g/15ml concentration, but 10g/15ml concentration
    recorded less whereas 15g/15ml had the least occurrence. However, the frequency
    of occurrence was very high on the control experiment. Frequency of soil-borne
    fungal pathogens of maize decreased with increase in concentration as well as
    <em>Trichoderma spp</em> occurrence in the soil across the treatments when compared
    to their controls. The treatments had higher inhibitory effects on all the soil-borne
    pathogens of maize at 15g/15ml at 10 WAP.
