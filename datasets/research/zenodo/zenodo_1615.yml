  title: Humidity and Salt Movement in the Environment of Soil at Different Structural
    Levels
  abstract: The article interprets the results of the research conducted with regard
    to the influence of the natural factors - hidrothermic regime on the salt accumulation
    in the saline soil of the Siyezen-Sumgayit massif. A comparative analysis of the
    water and salt migration in the soil monoliths of mixed structure strengthened
    with the natural ecological model, reinforced with the mixed and VO polymer, and
    a definition of the effective method of the salt movement under the influence
    of the Natural factors, are given in the article.
