  title: Identification Of Management Zones Based On Soil And Yield In Slope Citrus
    Field
  abstract: 'This paper aims to 1) describe the spatial variation of soil parameters
    and yield in a steep slope citrus field and 2) identify the management zones based
    on the variation of soil properties and yield from the point of view of a row-based
    irrigation system. The test field was located on Iwagi Island, Ehime Prefecture.
    Soil volumetric water content (VMC) and electrical conductivity (EC) were collected
    from 51 locations at 3 different depths: the ground surface, 20 cm depth, and
    40 cm depth. The yield data of 89 trees between 2010 and 2013 were also collected.
    Yield, VMC, EC, elevation and combination of yield and soil parameters were classified
    by cluster analysis with the fuzzy c-means method. The cluster analysis divided,
    VMC into 3 groups, EC into 3 or 4 groups, yield into 5 groups, elevation into<br>

    3 groups and combination of yield and soil parameters into 2 groups. The classified
    groups clearly showed the influence of cultivation of each variable. Comparing
    the row irrigation system with the cluster analysis results, row irrigation affected
    the yield and soil parameters. Some clustered groups in the same irrigation row
    were also observed. It is suggested that the existing row irrigation system can
    adjust the variability of the field yield.'
