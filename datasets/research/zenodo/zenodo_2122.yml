  title: A Study on Prospective Green Chemistry Alternatives for Organic Synthesis
    in Order to Promote Sustainable Development
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Rice is one of the most important sources of carbohydrates for
    humans. The non-degradable and carcinogenic characteristics of heavy metals are
    the main concerns. Intensive use of farm inputs, industrialization and urbanization
    cause heavy metals accumulation in the soil, water, and rice grains. This review
    aimed to assess heavy metals pollution in agricultural soil and their transformation
    into rice grains. It collected information from different journals, websites,
    and published reports on heavy metals in soils, water, and accumulated rice grains
    in the last 13 years. The analysis results illustrated that the amount of heavy
    metal in the soil and rice of different rice-producing countries was higher than
    the permissible limits of the WHO, United Kingdom, Tianjin, and European Union
    standards. The accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural land has become a
    threat to humans as well as the environment. Reports showed that the higher concentrations
    of heavy metals in rice grains may cause heart disease, diabetes, possibly stroke,
    liver changes, hearing changes, changes in blood pressure, diarrhea, flushing
    of the face, etc. in humans. Regular monitoring and strict regulations of industrial
    discharge and chemical fertilizer should be recommended for the safety of soil
    and public health in rice-producing countries.&lt;/p&gt;'
