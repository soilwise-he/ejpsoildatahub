  title: Change Soil Moisture Content from 2015 to 2016 during Rainy season in the
    Nile Basin of Ethiopia.
  abstract: In this paper soil moisture within 0 to 10cm of depth was compared in
    between 2015 and 2016 during Kirmet season in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. This
    time period was chosen to observe the impact of El-Nino event on soil moisture
    in the basin. Kirmet is the rainy season in Ethiopia; it starts in June 1 and
    end in September last. This season is very important for the most dominant crop
    Teff. The Dataset FLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.1 x 0.1 degree for
    Eastern Africa (GDAS and RFE2) V001 (FLDAS_NOAH01_A_EA_M) at GES DISC was used
    for this study. The same dataset was collected covering Nile basin for the Kirmet
    season (rainy) months June, July, August and September of the years 2015 and 2016.
    To find the change in the content of soil moisture the dataset 2016 was subtracted
    from 2015. The images representing the change were converted to point data. Finally
    to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of high values (hot spots)
    and low values (cold spots) Getis-Ord Gi* statistic was applied with Hot Spot
    Analysis tool of ArcGIS. The result shows during June, July, August and September
    Nile basin received less moisture content in the El-Nino year (2015) than the
    year 2016 as13.0%, 15.1%, 13.3%, and 14.5% of its total area respectively with
    99% of confidence level.
