  title: Influence of Cone Index on Mean Relative Growth Rate, Leaf Area Index and
    Yield of Soybean in Sandy Clay Soil
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nMean Relative Growth Rate (MRGR), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and\
    \ yield of soybean (varTGX-1448-2E) as affected by cone index in sandy clay soil\
    \ was tested. Soil tests were carried out before and during the experiment. Penetrometer\
    \ and moisture meter were used in measuring cone index and soil moisture content\
    \ before and after treatments. The area was cleared and harrowed. Four treatments\
    \ including a control were imposed on the land. A Mersey Fergusson \u2013 MF 275\
    \ Xtra2WD/4WD tractor with 75 Hp and 2,360 kg weight was used. The treatments\
    \ were PLH = Ploughed and Harrowed- zero passes of tractor wheels (control), PLC10\
    \ = Ploughed, harrowed\_ and compacted to10 passes of tractor wheels, PLC20 =\
    \ Ploughed, harrowed and compacted to 20 passes of tractor wheels, PLC30 = Ploughed,\
    \ harrowed and compacted to 30 passes of tractor wheels, These were replicated\
    \ three times making a total of twelve subplots. The treatments and replications\
    \ were laid in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). A soybean variety TGX-1448-2E\
    \ was planted and parameters were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 weeks\
    \ after planting (WAP). Among the variables measured were plant height, width,\
    \ number of leaves, leaf area, dry matter weight, and weight of threshed soybean.\
    \ Analysis of the data revealed that the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of 42.83 was realised\
    \ at cone index of 0.081 MPa. Thus the LAI reduced to 10.20 at cone index of 1.21\
    \ MPa. On the other hand Mean Relative Growth Rate (MRGR) of 79.66 was observed\
    \ at cone index of 0.081 MPa. Whereas at 1.21 MPa, a MRGR of 59.29 was observed.\
    \ While a MRGR of 52.36 was realised at cone index of 1.82 MPa. A yield of 2.50\
    \ t/ha was realised from soybean planted on PLH plots with an average cone index\
    \ value of 0.081 MPa. Whereas at higher cone index value of 1.21 MPa, only 1.15\
    \ t/ha of soybean yield was realised. A strong negative correlation exists between\
    \ cone index and growth, and yield variables.\_ Thus correlation values of -0.906,\
    \ -0.999, -0.983 exist for plant height, leaf area and yield of soybean respectively.\
    \ It can be concluded that increase cone index of soil leads to reduction in MRGR,\
    \ LAI and yield parameters of crops."
