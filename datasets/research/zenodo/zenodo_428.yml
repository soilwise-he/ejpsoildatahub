  title: "Soil Health Evaluation of Farmland Based on Functional Soil Management\u2014\
    A Case Study of Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, China"
  abstract: Given that farmland serves as a strategic resource to ensure national
    food security, blind emphasis on the improvement of food production capacity can
    lead to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Hence, the evaluation
    of soil health (SH) should comprehensively take soil productivity and ecological
    environmental effects into account. In this study, five functions from the perspective
    of functional soil management were summarized, including primary productivity,
    provision and cycling of nutrients, the provision of functional and intrinsic
    biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and
    regulation. For each soil function, in view of the natural and ameliorable conditions
    affecting SH, basic indicators were selected from the two aspects of inherent
    and dynamic properties, and restrictive indicators were chosen considering the
    external properties or environmental elements, with the minimum limiting factor
    method coupled with weighted linear model. The new evaluation system was tested
    and verified in Yixing City, China. The healthy and optimally functional soils
    were concentrated in the northeast and mid-west of Yixing City, whereas unhealthy
    soils were predominant in the south and around Taihu Lake. The main limitations
    to SH improvement included cation exchange capacity, nutrient elements, and soluble
    carbon. The SH evaluation method was verified using the crop performance validation
    method, and a positive correlation was noted between food production stability
    index and soil health index, indicating that the evaluation system is reasonable.
