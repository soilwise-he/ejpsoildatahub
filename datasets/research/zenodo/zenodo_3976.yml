  title: Influence Of Omf Application Rates On Post Field Soil Fertility Status Under
    Pawpaw (Carica Papaya L.) Varieties
  abstract: "Field study was conducted to determine the post field soil fertility\
    \ status responses of pawpaw (<em>Carica papaya </em>L.) var. homestead selection\
    \ and sunrise-solo orchards to organo-mineral fertilizer (OMF) rates applied at\
    \ 10, 20 40 t/ha where both the zero t/ha OMF and NPK 15:15:15 at 50 g/plant/month\
    \ served as control. The result showed that all pawpaw orchards treated with OMF\
    \ rates recorded significantly (p\u22640.01) higher % P, % K, Na and % organic\
    \ matter in soil compared to applied NPK which recorded lower Na. However, while\
    \ orchards plated with sole pawpaw were higher in soil bulk density (SBD), orchards\
    \ with homestead mixture were lower in SBD and significantly lower % organic matter\
    \ compared to obtainable under sunrise crop mixture which recorded lower Na and\
    \ Mg. In conclusion, as a result of loosening effect on soil particles, the homestead\
    \ pawpaw probably due to more rooting activities as well as the addition of organic\
    \ fertilizer to soils both had significant influence leading to lower SBD."
