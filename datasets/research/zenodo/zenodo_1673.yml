  title: 'Effects of microplastics on earthworms in agricultural soil: comparison
    of traditional and biodegradable plastics'
  abstract: 'The aim of our research is to study long-term effects of microplastics
    and plastic additives on earthworms in agricultural soil. Our research started
    in January 2022. The study focuses on plastics used in agriculture and compares
    possible differences between biodegradable and non-degradable plastics. The research
    plan includes several laboratory tests with different types of plastics and plastic
    additives and a field study. We have preformed the standard ecotoxicological tests
    with earthworms for two different plastic types. From these standard tests we
    have selected juvenile earthworms for new set of tests to study, do young earthworms
    react differently to plastic contamination of soil compared to fully grown individuals
    used in standardised tests. Our aim is to study how fast the worms will grow and
    when they reach full sexual maturity in soil with different concentrations of
    different types of plastics. In addition to survivability, growth and reproduction
    we also study uptake of plastics by earthworms, uptake of plastic additives and
    oxidative stress in earthworms caused by different plastic concentrations in tests
    soils. In the field study we will artificially contaminate several boxes of soil
    with different concentrations of plastics. We use two kinds of plastic types,
    biodegradable and non-degradable. Plastic is applied as fine microplastic powder.
    The plastic is applied to agricultural research field. Crops are planted in the
    field in spring. We will take soil samples to define characteristics of the soil.
    In autumn earthworm community samples are taken from the field and effects of
    the microplastic addition to earthworm community is observed. Currently we have
    some preliminary data from the laboratory studies. High plastic concentrations
    seem to have an effect on the growth of the earthworms, but long-term experiments
    has just started and more datapoints are needed. Earthworm samples from the field
    study will be taken during September 2022. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/426989/document'
