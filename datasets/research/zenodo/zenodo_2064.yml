  title: Exchange capacity of soils, metal mobilization and soil pollution by heavy
    metals in West Bengal
  abstract: 'Department of Chemistry, Kalyani University, Kalyani-741 235, India <em>E-mail</em>
    : sujitclahiri@yahoo.com River Research Institute. Nadia. India Central Forensic
    Science Laboratory, 30, Gorachand Road, Kolkata-700 014, India <em>Manuscript
    received 14 July 2004, revised 9 December 2004, accepted 10 December 2004</em>
    Exchangeable and non-exchangeable (obtainable under stress conditions) capacities
    of K-ion (and of other ions like Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>)
    and metal mobilization (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Ba, Mn, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn) in soils from
    different regions of West Bengal were examined. The results show that the exchange
    capacities of selected soil samples are good. The exchangeable and nonexchangeable
    (obtainable under stress conditions) K-contents are fairly good [1.03-8.5% of
    the total K (exchangeable) and 4.3-18% of the total K (non-exchangeable)]. Hg
    is conspicuously absent. There is appreciable metal mobilization and the results
    are interpreted in terms of concentration factor F<sub>M</sub> and the enrichment
    factor EF. However, in view of very low AI contents (compared to natural abundance),
    EF<strong> </strong>values become abnormally high. The results in terms of F<sub>M</sub>
    values suggest depletion of AI (abnormal), Fe (fairly high), K and Mg (fairly
    high) and enrichment of Ba, Ni and Zn in most cases. There is no appreciable depletion
    or enrichment for Cu, Cr (except in Patharpratima) and Mn. Na concentrations are
    high. Bi content is also fairly high indicating the possibility of presence of
    As and Sb. Metal requirements for plants and microbes must be different from their
    macroscopic concentrations in soils and in absence of true pollutional limits
    of metals in soils, comparison of the results are difficult. However, metal mobilization
    cannot be regarded to be alarming in soils though the concentrations of some metals
    are on the increase.'
