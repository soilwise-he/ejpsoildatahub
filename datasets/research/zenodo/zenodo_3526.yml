  title: Contamination of soil around non-ferrous metals smelter lead and cadmium
  abstract: Emissions of dust containing heavy metals from processing and smelting
    was the reason of contamination of the surroundings of non-ferrous metals smelter
    by zinc, lead, cadmium, and other metals. Heavy metals cumulated in soil and bound
    to the humic matter could be the reason of its degradation. Soils samples were
    taken along transects set with a compass in eight directions around non-ferrous
    metals smelter in Upper Silesia. The concentration of lead and cadmium was measured
    with conventional AAS method. The highest content of Pb in soil was found in a
    distance of about 1500 m from the smelter and highest content of Cd was found
    250 m from the metalurgical plant. It was probably due to grain-size composition
    of dust emitted by the smelter, local conditions of accumulation of heavy metals
    in the soil or the wind direction. The results indicated contamination of the
    soil environmental by heavy metals in the vicinity of the smelter.
