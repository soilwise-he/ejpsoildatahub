  title: Identification Of Suitable Soil Parameters For The Growth Of Brackishwater
    Aquaculture In Thiruvallur District Using Remote  Sensing And Gis
  abstract: "This paper is study on a identification of suitable soil parameters for\
    \ the growth of brackish water aquaculture in Thiruvallur district using remote\
    \ sensing and GIS. The present study area is located in the North Eastern part\
    \ of Tamil Nadu between 12\xB015\u2019 and 13\xB015' North and79\xB015' and80\xB0\
    20' East. The base map was created from Survey of India top sheet 1972. The soil\
    \ map was generated from IRS P6, LISS IV 2011satellite image (scale 1:50000) thematic\
    \ map and the soil details is obtained from geological survey of India. Using\
    \ visual interpretation keys, the various types of soil features were identified\
    \ like as Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, settlement, vertisols, Pondicherry,\
    \ Reserve forest miscellaneous, etc. The best suitable soil was analysed to give\
    \ the weight age parameters based on the overlay analysis."
