  title: Study of Strength Properties of Soil for Influence of the Inclusion of Recycled
    Jute Strands
  abstract: <em>In developing countries like India, the construction of a comprehensive
    road network is a major challenge due to limited financial resources. To address
    this, alternative materials and construction techniques are being explored to
    improve subgrade engineering properties. One such approach is the incorporation
    of recycled jute fiber, which is locally available and cost-effective. This study
    involved randomly mixing jute fibers with soil and conducting CBR and Direct Shear
    tests to evaluate the strength and shear parameters of the subgrade soil. Different
    fiber lengths and percentages were tested, and the results indicated that the
    addition of jute fiber improved the strength and stability of the subgrade. The
    CBR and Direct Shear tests showed an initial increase in strength with increasing
    fiber content up to a certain percentage, beyond which the values decreased. Permeability
    tests were also conducted. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential
    of recycled jute fiber as a viable additive for improving the performance of subgrade
    soils. The increased strength and stability provided by the jute fiber can contribute
    to the longevity and durability of road infrastructure, particularly in areas
    with limited resources. The use of locally available materials like jute fiber
    not only reduces construction costs but also promotes sustainable and eco-friendly
    practices in the field of civil engineering. Further research and field implementation
    of jute fiber reinforcement in road construction projects can pave the way for
    more efficient and resilient transportation networks in developing countries.</em>
