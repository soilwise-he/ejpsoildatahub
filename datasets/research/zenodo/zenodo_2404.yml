  title: Experimental Study on the Influence of Alccofine-1203 and Phosphogypsum on
    the Strength Characteristics of Expansive Soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Expansive soil is generally found
    in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. One of the main issues with these
    expansive soils is their swelling properties when their natural water content
    increases. The various swell-shrink tendencies of expansive soils cause numerous
    issues with the substructure and distress in infrastructures such as buildings,
    pavements, and breast walls, among others. Geotechnical engineers have worked
    hard to understand the behavior of expanding soil and implement appropriate management
    strategies. The current study aims to elucidate the efficacy of alcofine-1203
    and Phosphogypsum (PG) powder in achieving the geotechnical properties of soil
    and improving its high swell, high shrink, and low bearing capacity, which have
    benefits for civil engineering. The combination of the two materials can be more
    beneficial when used as a stabilizing agent than using them individually. An experimental
    programme has calculated the effects of alcofine-1203 (3, 6, 9, and 12%) and Phosphogypsum
    (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0%) on the Atterberg limits, optimum moisture content
    (OMC), unconfined compressive strength (UCS), maximum dry density (MDD), and other
    essential soil characteristics. Both admixtures were added independently and blended
    into the expansive soil. It was found that the liquid limit, plasticity index,
    optimum moisture content, and swelling behavior of the expansive soil have been
    greatly reduced with the addition of specified admixtures. UCS gradually increases
    from 46.4 kPa to 948 kPa after 56 days due to the combined effect of 12% alccofine
    and 1.0% Phosphogypsum reacting with soil, which plays a critical role when compared
    to the remaining admixture combination. Hence, the result concluded that the addition
    of 12% alccofine and 1.0% PG exhibited an essential improver of expansive soils,
    proved that adding the admixture is a potential stabilizer, and also proved that
    the problematic soil was transformed into the best soil. It also reduced the construction
    cost by making the best use of locally available materials.&lt;/p&gt;'
