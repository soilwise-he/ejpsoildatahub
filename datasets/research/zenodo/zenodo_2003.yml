  title: THE EFFECT OF AUTUMN WHEAT AND REPEAT CROPS ON THE AGROPHYSIC PROPERTIES
    OF THE SOIL
  abstract: Winter wheat repeated crops significantly affect the growth, development
    and yield of agricultural crops. As a result of the conducted research, it is
    shown that winter wheat and repeated oilseeds accumulating a huge amount of organic
    substances during the growing season positively affect the agrophysical properties
    of the soil, which contribute to the growth, development and increase of cotton
    yields in comparison with the control.
