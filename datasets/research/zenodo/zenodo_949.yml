  title: 'Soil Taxonomy or World Reference Base: how to classify Antarctic soils?'
  abstract: "Only 0.35% of Antarctica is ice-free. More than half of this territory\
    \ \u2013 about 53% is located in the Transantarctic Mountains and, in particular,\
    \ the Pensacola Mountains. About 20% \u2013 in the Antarctic Peninsula and the\
    \ surrounding islands, 11%, and 7% can be found in the Mac-Robertson Land and\
    \ by Queen Maud Land respectively. Temperature regimes, precipitation, plant coverage\
    \ are very different in these regions. Nowadays, more than 30 countries are conducting\
    \ research in Antarctica, but according to JG Bockheim (2015), only about 2,400\
    \ soil profiles were diagnosed and classified so far. 75% of them are in the Transantarctic\
    \ Mountains and 16% in the Antarctic Peninsula. Moreover, researchers in Antarctica\
    \ use various soil classifications, hence it is difficult and sometimes impossible\
    \ to compare and summarize the results of different studies"
