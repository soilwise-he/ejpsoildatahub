  title: Determination of Dispersivity in A Laboratory Soil Column
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this study, a laboratory soil column experiment was carried
    out for estimating the dispersivity in sandy loam soil by the inversion of the
    Advection Dispersion Equation. An 89 cm deep and 15 cm diameter cylindrical column
    was filled with sandy loam soil in such a way that the bulk density of the soil
    in field condition was strictly satisfied in the column. Potassium bromide was
    used as the conservative tracer in the study. The tracer concentration was allowed
    to pass through the column at a constant rate and the leachate collected at different
    time periods were tested for the concentration of bromide. The experiment was
    carried out until the relative concentration c c0 has reached 1. The calculated
    relative concentration was plotted against time for obtaining the observed breakthrough
    curve BTC . Another BTC was plotted using the analytical solution of Advection
    Dispersion Equation. The effective dispersion coefficient De value which gave
    the best fit between these two curves was chosen by trial and error method and
    the dispersivity of the soil was calculated De = v for a constant pore water velocity
    v . The dispersivity of the sandy loam soil under study was found to be 1.7 cm
    which matches well with the previous researches. M. R. Namitha | V. Ravikumar
