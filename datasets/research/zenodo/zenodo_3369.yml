  title: 'Soil Moisture Control System: A Product Development Approach'
  abstract: In this work, we propose the concept and geometrical design of a soil
    moisture control system (SMCS) module by following the product development approach
    to develop an inexpensive, easy to use and quick to install product targeted towards
    agriculture practitioners. The module delivers water to the agricultural land
    efficiently by sensing the soil moisture and activating the delivery valve. We
    start with identifying the general needs of the potential customer. Then, based
    on customer needs we establish product specifications and identify important measuring
    quantities to evaluate our product. Keeping in mind the specifications, we develop
    various conceptual solutions of the product and select the best solution through
    concept screening and selection matrices. Then, we develop the product architecture
    by integrating the systems into the final product. In the end, the geometric design
    is done using human factors engineering concepts like heuristic analysis, task
    analysis, and human error reduction analysis. The result of human factors analysis
    reveals the remedies which should be applied while designing the geometry and
    software components of the product. We find that to design the best grip in terms
    of comfort and applied force, for a power-type grip, a grip-diameter of 35 mm
    is the most ideal.
