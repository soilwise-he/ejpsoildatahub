  title: Characterization Of Novel Atrazine-Degrading Klebsiella Sp. Isolated From
    Thai Agricultural Soil
  abstract: Atrazine, a herbicide widely used in sugarcane and corn production, is
    a frequently detected groundwater contaminant. An atrazine-degrading bacterium,
    strain KB02, was obtained from long-term atrazine-treated sugarcane field soils
    in Kanchanaburi province of Thailand. Strain KB02 had a rod-to-coccus morphological
    cycle during growth. Sequence analysis of the PCR product indicated that the 16S
    rRNA gene in strain KB02 was ranging from 97-98% identical to the same region
    in Klebsiella sp. Based on biochemical, physiological analysis and 16S rDNA sequence
    analysis of one representative isolate, strain KB02, the isolates belong to the
    genus Klebsiella in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Interestingly that the various
    primers for atzA, B and C failed to amplify genomic DNA of strain KB02. Whereas
    the expected PCR product of atzA, B and C were obtained from the reference strain,
    Arthrobacter sp. strain KU001.
