    \ TIRUPATI TOWN, ANDHRA PRADESH"
  abstract: Geographical Information System is a very effective tool for capturing,
    displaying and analyzing geographically referenced data.GIS can be used for obtaining
    data at inaccessible locations, data visualization, data processing as well as
    preparation of post processing graphs and charts. This paper highlights creation
    of a soil resource inventory and database creation for thematic mapping using
    GIS.The results illustrate the vast potential of GIS towards soil mapping and
    effective management of soil data base. By using GIS, the users can produce the
    maps of soil classifications; obtain engineering information regarding soil type,
    an initial indication of soil properties.
