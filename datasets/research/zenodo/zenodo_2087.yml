  title: RESISTANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY INDICATORS OF CEREAL CROPS TO EXTERNAL FACTORS
    IN MEDIUM SALINITY SOIL - CLIMATE CONDITIONS
  abstract: This article is based on the data obtained in the field experiments conducted
    in order to determine the resistance to abiotic and biotic factors and productivity
    elements of barley and triticale varieties planted in the demonstration field
    of Syrdarya region. In the experiment carried out in field conditions, when the
    plants were harvested and the biological yield was determined, the triticale "Boyovut"
    variety - 88.3 t/ha, the "Tuyatish" variety - 83.1 t/ha, the barley "Mashuldar"
    variety - 67.6 ts/ha, in "Sayhun" variety - 69.0 ts/ha and in "Syrdarya" variety
    - 65.8 ts/ha. It was observed that the indicators of resistance to external factors
    were higher in barley varieties, and based on the biological capabilities of the
    plant, productivity elements were higher in triticale varieties compared to barley
    varieties
