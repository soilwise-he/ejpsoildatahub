  title: Children Quitting Soil Eating Habit After Having A Diet Consisting Of Meat
    And Calcium
  abstract: "<em>The objective of this study was to make children quit the habit of\
    \ soil eating by administeringmeat, as a source of nutrients like proteins, vitamins\
    \ and minerals along with oral calcium which can be given in the form of a chewable\
    \ tablet. </em>\n\n<em>Data of 85 children of both genders was taken having a\
    \ soil eating habit. On the basis of age children were divided into 3 groups,\
    \ i.e. children of 2 to 6 years of age, childrenof 6 to 12 years of age and children\
    \ above 12 years of age. Children were given one tablespoon of minced meat and\
    \ a tablet of calcium daily for as long as the child takes to quit the soil eating\
    \ </em>\n\n<em>This course of treatment was proven to be fairly effective. The\
    \ reason forthis success was the fact that the cause behind soil eating is the\
    \ body\u2019s requirement forcertain nutrients (e.g.Anemicpeople have been reported\
    \ to have such a habit, cause being iron deficiency) and soil or clay has all\
    \ these nutrients, i.e. iron, calcium, zinc, proteins, vitamins etc. and so this\
    \ need can also be fulfilled through a diet of meat and additional administration\
    \ of calcium.</em>\n\n<em>Results showed that children of ages 2 to 6 years quit\
    \ the soil eating habit the fastest in which males quit in 10 days while females\
    \ in 12 days.</em>\n\n<strong>Keywords:</strong><em> Soil eating habit, Oral Calcium,\
    \ Vitamin and Protein.</em>"
