  title: "Improving the diagnostics of underground pipelines at oil\xADand\xADgas\
    \ enterprises based on determining hydrogen exponent (PH) of the soil media applying\
    \ neural networks"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A set of key parameters and information flows has been formed
    to simulate stages of probing the outside surface of underground metal pipelines
    (UMP) taking into account pH of the soil contacting with the pipe metal.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Specimens of 17G1S steel placed in acid, alkaline and neutral media were
    examined using a polarization potential meter in a complex with a contactless
    current meter. Principles of application of neural networks (NN) in processing
    experimental results were formulated. A database has been developed. It meets
    the initial conditions for controlling the soil pH at the boundary with the metal
    under real conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Elements of the optimization approach for assessing pH of a coated UMP
    in the soil medium were proposed. The approach is based on the multiplicative
    qualimetric criterion of quality for the UMP section taking into account two groups
    of coefficients. The first group of coefficients refers to the internal coefficients
    and characterizes the metal pipeline and the second group refers to the external
    medium (i.e., soil electrolyte). Elements of the optimization approach for assessing
    pH of the coated pipeline in the soil medium were proposed.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;An NN was presented for the &quot;pipeline-coating&quot; system, which:&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;1)&nbsp;is capable of solving the problem of cluster analysis and image
    classification;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;2)&nbsp;makes it possible to process data without their prior spectral
    transformation operating with discrete counts of information signals.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The proposed NN type allows it to dynamically expand its own knowledge
    base of possible types of defects in controlled objects (pipelines) in the process
    of operation. With the help of the NN, soil pH was assessed for an UMP of 17G1S
    steel for three situations.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The above information is important for improving the methods for controlling
    oil-and-gas enterprise UMPs, in particular, the methods for a correct assessment
    of anode current density in metal defects taking into account nonlinear character
    of informative parameters.&lt;/p&gt;'
