  title: Relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes on soil microbial
    community assembly in temperate grasslands
  abstract: "This study explored \u03B2-diversity of soil microbes and its drivers\
    \ in temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia. This study presents a comprehensive\
    \ understanding on the \u03B2-diversity of soil microbial com-munities in temperate\
    \ grasslands in norther China. Our findings highlight the importance of soil depth,\
    \ phylogenetic turnover, and species abundance in the assembly processes of soil\
    \ microbial communities. This uploaded file included all supplementary files related\
    \ to a submitted manuscript."
