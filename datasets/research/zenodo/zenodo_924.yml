  title: An Experimental Study on Stabilization of Clayey Soil Using SCBA
  abstract: 'In developing countries like India, due to remarkable development in
    road infrastructure, soil stabilization has become a major issue in constructional
    activity, stabilization is not only a method of altering or modifying of one or
    more soil properties to improve the engineering. Characteristics and performance
    of soil, but also processing available materials for the production of low -cost
    design and construction. Black cotton soils which expand when the moisture content
    of soils is increased the clay mineral Montmorillonite is main responsible for
    expansive characteristics of the soil. the expansive soils called swelling of
    soils or black cotton soils a large part of south India is covered with expansive
    soil another problem with this soil is strength decreases with increases of the
    degree of saturation heavy damages may occur buildings roads runways pipelines
    and other structures built on such soils if proper preventive measures are not
    a method. The damages can be prevented to a large extent if characteristics of
    expansive soil properly assessed suitable measures taken in design construction
    and maintenance of structures built on soils. This presents an experimental investigation
    to study the effect of sugarcane baggage ash on swelling and shrinkage and mechanical
    properties of soil. After finding out the experimental results in the lab to know
    the evaluation and performance of baggage ash on the black cotton soil in the
    laboratory. Black cotton soil and Sugar cane baggage ash have prepared by varying
    of different proportions with respect to dry the density. P. Cheenakesavalu |
