  title: Predicting Lead and Nickel Contamination in Soil using Spectroradiometer
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the geosciences, visible&ndash;near&ndash;short-wave infrared
    reflectance spectroscopy seems to have the capability to become a helpful technique
    for soil classification, mapping, and remote confirmation of soil characteristics
    and mineral composition. Focus on improving the spatial resolution of soil maps
    in order to better deal with localized problems like soil pollution. A variety
    of physio-chemical properties were measured in long-term spiked soils with a range
    of lead and nickel concentrations and also their spectral reflectance between
    400 and 2500 nm at three different locations in the agricultural region of MIDC,
    Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. Principle component analysis (PCA) used for feature
    extraction of soil were partial least squares regression (PLSR) method is used
    for classification. To measured amount of lead and nickel in soil sample, thirteen
    features of soil samples are calculated. The main aim of this study was to use
    statistical methods to calculate the lead and nickel concentrations in soil, as
    well as to assess the efficiency of VNIR-SWIR reflectance spectroscopy for heavy
    metal estimation in soil using the ASD FieldSpec4 Spectroradiometer. R2 = 0.96
    provides the best precision for lead content and R2 = 0.95 for nickel content
    in soil, according to the findings. Lead and nickel have RMSEs of 3.396 and 2.680,
    respectively. The outcomes show that the proposed method is capable of accurately
    forecasting lead and nickel concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;'
