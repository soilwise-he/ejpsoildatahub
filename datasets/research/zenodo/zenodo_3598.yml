  title: Evaluation of Soil Engineering Characteristics of Some Soils in Entisol and
    Inceptisol
  abstract: "Abstract The soils of the research area are classified in Entisol and\
    \ Inceptisol Orders. Entisol Order is classified in Typic Xerofluvent Subgroup,\
    \ Inceptisol Order is classified in Fluventic Haploxerept, Calcic Haploxerept,\
    \ Typic Haploxerept subgroup. The adhesion, cohesion and shear resistance values\
    \ of the soils and therefore the behavior of the soils against cultivation and\
    \ depending on the soil engineering properties are very different. For this reason,\
    \ the functions of moisture in soils should be well evaluated in the mechanization\
    \ conditions of soils. Otherwise, air, water and communication will be adversely\
    \ affected by compaction layers, which are undesirable in the soil, and decreasing\
    \ porosity rates, and root development will not be under normal conditions, and\
    \ undesirable physical conditions occur. The liquid limit values of the soils\
    \ entering the Entisol Order vary between 30.60% and 58.60% in surface horizons,\
    \ and between 35.90% and 56.60% in subsurface horizons. Differences in liquid\
    \ limit values are due to the privileges in the clay fractions of the soils. The\
    \ liquid limit values of the soils entering the Inceptisol Orders vary between\
    \ 27.80-40.10%. The plastic limit values of Entisol Order soils vary between 14.17-26.55%\
    \ and 9.86-16.92% of Inseptisol Order soils. Classification according to the Casagranda\
    \ plasticity card is CL- moderately plastic inorganic clays for Ineptisol Order,\
    \ while Entisol Order is classified as CH- Excess plastic inorganic clays. The\
    \ moisture value, which provides the most suitable tempering conditions, varies\
    \ between 16\xB11-23\xB11 in Entisol Orders soil and 12.5\xB11-18\xB11 in Inceptisol\
    \ Orders."
