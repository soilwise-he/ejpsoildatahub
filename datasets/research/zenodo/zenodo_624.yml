  title: Knowedge needs and gaps on soil and land management
  abstract: "Soil health is vital for many ecosystem services. The Horizon Europe\
    \ (HE) Mission \u201CA Soil Deal for Europe\u201D aims to accelerate the transition\
    \ to sustainable soil and land management and healthy soils through an am-bitious\
    \ transdisciplinary research and innovation (R&amp;I) programme, largely based\
    \ on actor engagement, Liv-ing Labs and Lighthouses. The H2020 Soil Mission Support\
    \ (SMS) project supported the implementation of the HE Mission, and aimed to improve\
    \ the coordination of R&amp;I on sustainable soil and land management. Through\
    \ a co-creation process together with actors, SMS collated available knowledge,\
    \ actors R&amp;I needs and identified R&amp;I gaps that need to be addressed for\
    \ successful transition towards sustainable soil and land management.<br> The\
    \ first step was to identify existing R&amp;I knowledge through a keyword-based\
    \ analysis of scientific literature published and peer reviewed, related to sustainable\
    \ soil and land management. The literature analysis ad-dressed the full range\
    \ of societal challenges, soil health objectives, land use types and knowledge\
    \ domains necessary to capture the socio-ecological complexity of soil health.\
    \ Covering some 15,700 scientific articles, this literature analysis represents\
    \ the current peer reviewed knowledge stock on sustainable soil and land management.\
    \ A textual analysis using the digital platform CorTexT was undertaken to explore\
    \ the identified literature and submitted to project consortium internal experts,\
    \ who analysed and processed the collected information of their respective area\
    \ of expertise (Annex III). The literature analysis revealed that the societal\
    \ challenges \u201Creduce soil degradation\u201D and \u201Cimprove disaster control\u201D\
    \ have been studied extensively. Con-versely, the societal challenges \u201Cmitigate\
    \ land take\u201D and \u201Cincrease biodiversity\u201D and the knowledge domains\
    \ \u201Cscience-based policy support\u201D and \u201Cawareness, training &amp;\
    \ education\u201D are less discussed. Factsheets present-ing the results of the\
    \ literature analysis per societal challenge were developed and can be found in\
    \ Annex VIII. Note that as the key-word based literature search was limited to\
    \ Scopus-indexed scientific journals, other publishing formats such as conference\
    \ papers, books, book chapters, non-digitalized articles, grey literature, reports,\
    \ patents, etc., may be underrepresented or not included in the used data base.\
    \ The exclusive use of Scopus-indexed scientific articles provided quality insurance\
    \ of the material through the publication peer-review system. Nonetheless, important\
    \ documents and knowledge have been incorporated by the consor-tium experts when\
    \ analysing the collected literature.<br> The second step was to consult actors\
    \ through online workshops and surveys in order to gain a practice-oriented \u2018\
    real-life\u2019 picture of current knowledge and R&amp;I needs for swift implementation\
    \ of sustainable soil and land management. This step was seen as complementary\
    \ of the published and peer-reviewed literature.<br> Finally, after exploring\
    \ our stocktaking of R&amp;I from existing knowledge evidenced by literature review\
    \ and the actor\u2019s knowledge needs identified from actor consultations, we\
    \ identified R&amp;I gaps. The main knowledge gaps across all Mission Objectives\
    \ were of socio-economic nature: drivers and causes of land degradation, knowledge\
    \ management, governance and policies for inciting improved management, and interaction\
    \ with other sectors are not sufficiently understood. Second, the HE Missions\u2019\
    \ focus on improving soil literacy was supported by the literature analysis and\
    \ by the actor consultation, which both revealed knowledge gaps re-lated to education\
    \ and capacity building in all land use types and domains affecting soil health:\
    \ production, consumption, trade, policy and governance. Thirdly, there is a gap\
    \ in the long-term implementation of a new mode of knowledge co-design, where\
    \ researchers and practitioners together develop solutions for sustaina-ble soil\
    \ and land management in a real-world context. The HE Missions\u2019 focus on\
    \ Living Labs and Lighthouses has the potential to close this gap. Finally, there\
    \ is a need to define several concepts (e.g. soil health, soil degradation, footprint).\
    \ Such definitions should be shared and will be a basis to identify relevant indicators\
    \ and respective thresholds, and to develop guidelines to support monitoring programmes\
    \ in order to translate knowledge into evidence for decision making.<br> The outcome\
    \ of the deliverable is a list of validated R&amp;I gaps across all Mission Objectives\
    \ which will feed into the SMS roadmap and the HE Mission."
