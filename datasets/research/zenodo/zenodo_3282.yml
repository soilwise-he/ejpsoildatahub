  title: Soil Practices with relation to Soil Fertilities
  abstract: 'Soil organic matter is often realized as an indicator of soil fertility,
    however, agricultural practices are expected to cause changed. This study was
    conduct to evaluate the relationship of soil practices and organic matter content.
    Fifty-eight plots were sampled (0- to 30-cm depth) from three different study
    areas. These are included two areas from high performance cropping system, and
    the remainder from low intensive practices. The soil management, including tillage,
    fertilizer and pesticide application, was also considered. To compare the difference
    of organic matter levels among three areas, together with fertilizer, pesticide
    and tillage practices, one-way ANOVA and the independent t-test were performed.
    The means of organic matter do differ significantly among three study areas (P&lt;0.05)
    whereas these values do not differ significantly among the other factors considered
    in this research (P&gt;0.05). Basic agricultural practices show the highest levels
    of organic matter. Evidence regarding intensive soil performance to obtain high
    economic yield is raised with result of this study.Read Complete Article at ijSciences:
