  title: Residual Effect of Integrated Nutrient Management Approach on the Growth
    and Yield of Amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus L.) on an Acidic Soil of Southeastern
    Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of
    Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, to ascertain the residual effect
    of Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) on the growth and yield of amaranthus
    (amaranthus cruentus L) on an acidic soil of Southeastern Nigeria. The treatment
    comprised of sole urea (UA) applied at 6.25t/ha, sole CaCO3 (LM) applied at 4t/ha,
    sole pig waste (PW) applied at 10t/ha, combination of 5t/ha of pig waste + 3.125t/ha
    of urea +5t/ha of mulch (PW+UA+ML), combination of 5t/ha of pig waste + 3.125t/ha
    of urea +5t/ha of mulch + 2t/ha of CaCO3 (PW+UA+ML+LM), combination of 5t/ha of
    pig waste + 3.125t/ha of urea + 5t/ha + CaCO3 (PW+UA+ LM) and a control (C). The
    treatments were replicated three times in a Randomized Complete Block Design and
    were applied once in August 2010. The test crop amaranthus was planted in 2010
    and 2011 on the same piece of land. The results obtained showed that PW+UA+ML+LM
    significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased the plant height at the two years, with
    the values of 46 cm and 39cm respectively. It also significantly (P &lt; 0.05)
    increased the dry matter yield, nitrogen and potassium concentration in the plants.
    The study showed that the combination of PW+UA+ML+LM improved most of the plant
    parameters tested and had a lasting residual effect in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
