  title: Bioconversion of waste paper into soil conditioner and its effect on plants
    growth and microbial population of the soil
  abstract: "This research work focused on bioconversion of waste paper into soil\
    \ conditioner and its effect on plants growth and soil microbial population. The\
    \ effects were studied for 21 days and the number of seeds germinated and their\
    \ height were measured at 3 days interval. Percentage (%) seed germination across\
    \ the samples was 100 %. The height of the plants in soil treated with composted\
    \ waste paper ranged between 80\xB10.98 mm and 643\xB1 1.76 mm that of control\
    \ soil ranged between 70\xB11.98 mm and 503\xB11.67 mm. The result for the microbial\
    \ analysis revealed a total bacterial count range from 4.0\xB1 1.01 to 6.9\xB1\
    1.03 x10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g for soil samples treated with composted waste paper\
    \ and 5.0\xB10.78 to 6.1\xB11.29 x10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g for control. The results\
    \ also revealed a total of eight bacterial genera and they include; <em>Bacillus</em>\
    \ sp, <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp, <em>E.coli</em>, <em>Micrcoccus </em>sp, <em>Staphylococuss</em>\
    \ sp, <em>Proteus</em> sp, <em>Enterobacter</em> sp, <em>Klebsiella</em> sp respectively.\
    \ Total fungal count ranged from 1.5\xB10.97 to 2.9\xB10.92 x 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g\
    \ for soil samples treated with composted waste paper. A total of five fungal\
    \ genera were isolated and they included <em>Aspergillus</em> sp, <em>Penicillium</em>\
    \ sp, <em>Mucor</em> sp, <em>Rhizopus</em> sp, and <em>Sacharomyces</em> sp respectively.\
    \ The most prevalent bacterium across the sample was <em>Bacillus</em> sp with\
    \ 33.33 % while the most prevalent fungus across the sample was <em>Penicillium\
    \ </em>sp with 41.67 %."
