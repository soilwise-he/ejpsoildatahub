  title: Effects of Biochar and Silicate Application on Soil Enzyme Activities under
    Nighttime Warming in Paddy Soil
  abstract: "Climate warming has one of important characteristics that the temperature\
    \ increase at night is greater than that during the day. Many reports have been\
    \ available regarding the effects of nighttime warming, silicate or biochar application\
    \ on the growth, physiology and yield in rice, but it is unclear regarding the\
    \ effects of the three factors on soil enzyme activities in paddy fields. A field\
    \ simulation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of biochar\
    \ and silicate supply on soil enzyme activities in rice soil under nighttime warming.\
    \ The orthogonal experimental design with three-factor and three-level was adopted\
    \ in the experiment. The nighttime warming was treated by covering the rice canopy\
    \ with aluminum foil reflective film at night (19:00~6:00). The nighttime warming\
    \ was set at three levels, ambient temperature control (W0), covering rice canopy\
    \ with 5mm aluminum foil film (W1), and with 11 mm aluminum foil film (W2); biochar\
    \ supply was designed with 3 levels, i.e., control (B0), 7.5 t\xB7hm<sup>-2</sup>\
    \ biochar (B1) and 17.5 t\xB7hm<sup>-2</sup> (B2); silicate application had three\
    \ levels, i.e., control (Si0), steel slag powder (Si1, 200 kg\xB7hm<sup>-2</sup>),\
    \ and ore powder (Si2, 200 kg\xB7hm<sup>-2</sup>). Root bag method was used to\
    \ separate rhizospheric soil from non-rhizospheric soil. The soil samples were\
    \ collected at rice main growth periods (elongation, booting, flowering and filling)\
    \ to determine the activities of urease, invertase, cellulase and protease in\
    \ the soil. The results showed that, the activities of urease, invertase and cellulase\
    \ in non-rhizospheric soil increased under nighttime warming with 5 mm reflective\
    \ film (W1). Soil invertase and protease activities increased in the treatment\
    \ without biochar application (B0), while urease and cellulase activities enhanced\
    \ in the treatment with biochar application (B1 and B2). Silicate application\
    \ increased the activities of soil enzymes mentioned above. This study suggests\
    \ the treatment with W2B1Si0 is the optimal combination. Soil enzyme activities\
    \ were inhibited in the treatment with W2B1Si0, implying that the decomposition\
    \ of organic carbon and nitrogen in paddy soil will be likely decreased with applying\
    \ biochar without silicate supply under climate warming."
