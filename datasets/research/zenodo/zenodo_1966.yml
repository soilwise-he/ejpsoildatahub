  title: Soil Carbon Forms and Organic Matter Distribution in Arable Soils of Rigachikun,
    Northern Kaduna, Nigeria
  abstract: "The study was done in Rigachikun Kaduna, Northern Guinea Savanna and\
    \ intended to investigate the carbon forms such as Organic carbon, carbon loss\
    \ on ignition (LOI), Biomass microbial carbon (BMC) as well as organic matter\
    \ distribution of the studied soils. A reconnaissance survey was carried out in\
    \ the study location using the developed Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Soils\
    \ were delineated into mapping units using the cropping land uses namely maize,\
    \ cowpea and rice. In each of the cropping land use, three profile pits were sited\
    \ giving a total of nine profile pits. Organic carbon contents of investigated\
    \ soils were low and decreased down the horizon in all investigated pedons. This\
    \ trend follows closely to organic matter which decreased in the same pattern\
    \ with the values of organic carbon. Carbon LOI had a very highly significant\
    \ relationship with BMC and OM, non-significantly correlated with Carbon/Nitrogen\
    \ ratio, Clay, pH, K, Na and total exchangeable acidity (TEA). Biomass carbon\
    \ had a negative and significant correlation with organic carbon, very highly\
    \ and significant correlation with organic matter. BMC tolled the path of LOI\
    \ in its relationship with other soil properties investigated. Also, all carbon\
    \ forms (LOI, BMC, OC and OM) investigated exhibited high (CV &gt; 35%) coefficient\
    \ of variation in all investigated locations except in pedon 3 of location B where\
    \ BMC varied moderately and pedons 1 and 2 of Location C (Rice soils) where they\
    \ all varied moderately (CV &gt;15 \u2264 35%). Generally organic matter content\
    \ of the soils was very low resulting from continual use of crop litters in the\
    \ feeding of farm animals rather than incorporating them to the soils. Soil degradation,\
    \ erosion and desert encroachment have also affected soil of north western Nigeria\
    \ so immensely"
