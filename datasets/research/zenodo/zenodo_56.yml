  title: 'Soil Monitor: an internet platform to challenge soil sealing in Italy'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This work proposes a new type of web-based geospatial decision
    support system&mdash;called Soil Monitor&mdash;which provides a multidisciplinary
    operational tool useful for a multi-stakeholder community to challenge soil sealing.
    Various technological and technical features of Soil Monitor are presented and
    discussed with particular reference to the combination of WebGIS with on-the-fly
    geospatial processing based on GPU computing, specifically designed to allow real-time
    requests. In addition, we present three quantitative analysis of soil sealing
    at three different scales. The study at national level illustrated that the type
    of land use strongly affected soil-sealing dynamics. Indeed, the class&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;complex
    cultivation pattern&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;resulted the most fragile land use while&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;forests&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;resulted
    the most resilient one. The study at province level illustrated the key importance
    of having on-the-fly the map of rural fragmentation for any Italian province.
    This map&mdash;quantifying the landscape integrity of the rural and natural areas&mdash;enables
    to better locate both new green corridors or new urban developments minimizing
    the environmental impact of human activities. The study at municipality level
    demonstrated the importance of quantifying a pool of spatial planning indicators
    and illustrated that (a) the largest urban dispersion occurs in hilly touristic
    municipalities close to the sea, (b) the increase in soil sealing in rural sites
    is not related to population growth. As a result, Soil Monitor is deemed useful
    both to support decision making at different spatial scales and to raise awareness
    in people, professionals, and experts of other fields. Keywords soil sealing,
