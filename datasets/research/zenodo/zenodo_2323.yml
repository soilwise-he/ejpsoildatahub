  title: Enhanced remediation of a real HCH-polluted soil by the synergetic alkaline
    and ultrasonic activation of persulfate
  abstract: "The desorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) and limited mass\
    \ transfer in soil systems is a significant challenge for efficient soil remediation\
    \ by oxidation treatments. The utilization of sonochemistry is a promising technology\
    \ to enhance the decontamination of HOCs-polluted soils. In this work, ultrasound\
    \ (US) was coupled to NaOH for activating persulfate (PS) to improve the remediation\
    \ for natural soil polluted with hexa-chlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (\u03A3HCHs =\
    \ 404 mg kg\u2212 1 ). Batch experiments (mass aqueous/soil ratio, VL/WS = 2)\
    \ were performed to evaluate the effect of US on HOCs desorption and oxidation.\
    \ Moreover, the influence of US power (0\u2013245 W, corresponding to 0\u2013\
    91 W L-1 of US power density) and the initial oxidant concentration (CPS = 10\u2013\
    60 g L-1) on pollutants abatement, dechlorination degree, and oxidant consumption\
    \ have been studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images verified that the\
    \ US facilitates the breakdown of soil aggregates, enhancing the desorption of\
    \ trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) (generated from HCHs alkaline hydrolysis) from the\
    \ soil. Moreover, their subsequent oxidation is favouring because of higher radical\
    \ species concentrations and the temperature rise. An increase in the US power\
    \ up to 165 W accelerates the production rate of radicals, improving the pollutants\u2019\
    \ degradation. The difference between pollutant oxidation and dechlorination decreases\
    \ with increasing US power, associated with a lower concentration of intermediate\
    \ chlorinated compounds. In the same way, the initial oxidant concentration plays\
    \ a fundamental role in the remediation treatment. At the selected operating conditions\
    \ (CPS = 60 g L-1, NaOH/PS = 2, 165 W), a pollutants degradation and dechlorination\
    \ of 0.94 and 0.74, respectively, were achieved in just 3 h of reaction time."
