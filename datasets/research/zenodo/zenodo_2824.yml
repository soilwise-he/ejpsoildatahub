  title: 'The Experimental Failure behaviour of a Prestressed Concrete Electricity
    Transmission Pole: A Case Study for Kannauj Soil, Uttar Pradesh, India'
  abstract: Pre-stressed Cement concrete poles are widely used for supporting electricity
    supply lines throughout India. Its common observation that the poles fail under
    heavy wind as well as earthquakes. The response of the poles depends upon the
    strength of pole material, supporting soil, and depth of embedment of the pole.
    To economize the erection its general practice to erect the pole as the self-supporting
    pole. This paper investigates the behaviour of a prototype self-supporting electric
    pole for two different kinds of soil compaction material with respect to monotonic
    lateral load. Load versus displacement in loading and unloading is analysed for
    two different soil conditions. The geotechnical design considerations are suggested
    for the embedment of poles in soils.
