  title: A novel method to test for lead contamination in soil around US schools
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;It has been rumored that soils around schools in the US are
    contaminated with lead, which is known to be harmful to children, and is known
    to inhibit plant growth. The purpose of this study is to investigate the growth
    of plants in soil sampled from US schools to see if decreased plant growth can
    indicate lead contamination before testing is done. After comparing the time until
    germination, height, and root length of radishes grown in soil from the surrounding
    area of the school to that of those grown in uncontaminated soil, we found that
    radishes grown in soil from schools germinated at a rate 38% slower than radishes
    grown in uncontaminated soil (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.33-1.2, Ptrend = 0.13). The
    mean radish heights between the two groups were also found to be significantly
    different (p = 0.12). Decreased plant growth may serve as an indicator for soil
    contamination before other laboratory tests are done. It is recommended that further
    testing for lead and other toxins should be conducted on the soil of the surrounding
    area, and larger studies with multiple species of plants should be conducted to
    see if these trends could be applied to the general plant population around schools.&lt;/p&gt;'
