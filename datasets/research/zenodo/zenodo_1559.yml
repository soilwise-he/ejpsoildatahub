  title: Use of Shear Wave Velocity in Evaluation of Soil Layer's Condition After
    Liquefaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;After liquefaction occurrence, summits on the surface of the
    earth and inside the soil layers that damage the structures based on them or buried
    structures and vital arteries. In the last two decades, various quasi-experimental
    methods have been presented to determine the amount of strain (siting) and shear
    strain maximum based on field data and laboratory data. The main purpose of this
    study was to compare the results of evaluation of the potential of liquefaction
    occurrence from the viewpoint of the risk of occurrence and the amount of settling
    after the occurrence of liquefaction on in the soil layers based on the use of
    the results of the standard penetration resistance (SPT) and shear wave velocity
    (Vs) along the path 2nd line of Tabriz metro. In this study, 54 borehole loops
    were first collected along the line 2 of the metro mentioned. Then, the liquefaction
    potential in the studied area is based on the proposed methods and the liquefaction
    risk index (LPI) is estimated. Then, the amount of probable sum of the soil layers
    due to liquefaction occurred based on the results of the two proposed methods.
    The results of the research show that the two methods are not suitable for matching
    and the risk of liquefaction arising from the SPT method is less than the Vs method.
    Also, the prediction of the amount of settling after the occurrence of liquefaction
    in the soil layers has more amount based on the shear wave velocity method in
    comparison with the standard penetration resistance test method.&lt;/p&gt;'
