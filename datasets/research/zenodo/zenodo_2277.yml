  title: Optimization of the production of Bioethanol from waste Newspaper using Yeast
    isolate from Palm oil polluted soil
  abstract: The high cost of bioethanol resulting from the uneconomical price of feedstocks
    has led to the investigation of potential feedstocks from inedible substances
    such as lignocellulosic materials including waste biomass. One of the problems
    of producing bioethanol from waste biomass is low yield coupled with the high
    cost of organic catalysts. The current work was geared towards optimizing the
    concentration of bioethanol from the fermentation of waste newspapers using yeast
    isolate from palm oil polluted soil. The optimization was conducted using Central
    Composite Design in Design Expert software. The experimental parameters considered
    included pH, inoculum size, incubation time and carbon:nitrogen ratio, and the
    results obtained show that quadratic models best fitted bioethanol, yeast biomass
    and reducing sugar experimental data. The interaction of inoculum size and incubation
    time impacted most on the concentrations of the bioethanol, yeast biomass and
    reducing sugar. The optimum concentrations of bioethanol (30.12 mg/mL), yeast
    biomass (0.82 mg/mL) and reducing sugar (3.0 mg/mL) were obtained using operating
    condition of pH (7), inoculum size (6 %), inocubation time (14 days) and carbon:nitrogen
    ratio (52). The bioethanol being produced from waste feedstock, and yeast isolated
    from palm oil polluted soil could be more economical than the conventional gasoline,
    and the process developed could serve as a sustainable waste newspaper disposal
    management.
