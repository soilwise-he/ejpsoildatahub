  title: CRITICAL SOIL OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL
    WASTE, LIVESTOCK, AND FISHERIES
  abstract: 'Critical land area in Indonesia was recorded 23.25 million ha in 2000,
    and increased to 77.8 million ha in 2007, efforts are needed to optimize it. However,
    the existence of agricultural waste, livestock waste and sewage abundant fishery
    potential to increase soil fertility has not been utilized to the maximum. This
    study aimed to determine the macro nutrient content available in waste after the
    fermentation process. This research is an experimental research conducted in a
    laboratory to find out the content of: N, P, K, C / N ratio. The method for making
    liquid organic fertilizer is fermentation for one month using EM4 effective microorganisms,
    then analyzed using Spectrometry and Titrimetry Kjeldahl. The results showed that
    the highest N content was in bio urine fermentation (0.126%), fish waste (0.035%)
    and mixed waste (0.028%); The highest P was found in cattle rumen (7.239 mg /
    L), bio urine (5.234 mg / L), and seaweed (4.689 mg / L), and highest K was found
    in fruit waste (7, 801 mg / L). The highest C / N ratio was found in seaweed (55,643%)
    and fruit waste (27,857%). The conclusion is that agricultural waste, livestock
    waste, and fisheries waste after 1 month of fermentation contain adequate nutrients
    for optimizing critical land.'
