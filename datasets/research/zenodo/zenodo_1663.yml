  title: Extraction and detection of microplastics from agriculture soil near industrial
    area of kapurthala (Punjab)
  abstract: 'Microplastics in soil have been found in large quantities and MPs cause
    adverse effects on agricultural soil fauna. Microplastic pollution in the soil
    has become a major global issue. Understanding the occurrence, fate, and impacts
    of microplastic requires reliable methods for their extraction and identification.
    The study aims to evaluate the extraction and detection of microplastics from
    agricultural soil by using density floatation and filtration method employing
    NaCl and including the pre-digestion of soil with hydrogen peroxide to remove
    all the organic matter present in the soil. High-density salt solutions were more
    efficient in separating small microplastic particles in the soil. The first approach
    to identify microplastics is naked eye or microscopy. Another technique to identify
    microplastics is the ATR-FTIR spectrophotometer, such as fibres, fragments, and
    film identified by using ATR- FTIR spectrophotometer. The extracted microplastics
    were polypropylene, polybutylene tetrapthalate; polyethylene, polystyrene and
    polyethylene tetrapthalate and the size of particles was determined by using microscope.
    Several analytical techniques used for characterization of MPS, such as SEM and
    XRD. This study concludes that the size range of extracted microplastics is Also
