  title: Soil And Building Interaction Under Earthquake Loads
  abstract: <em>Soil-building interaction is an important factor to reduce the damage
    of structures under various dynamic effects. This interaction refers to the effect
    of dynamic properties of the ground such as seismic wave propagation, dispersion,
    reflection and absorption on the seismic performance of the structure. Therefore,
    it is of great importance to consider the soil-foundation interaction during building
    design and construction. Soil-foundation interaction depends on many factors that
    determine how structures will behave under earthquake loads. These factors include
    building material, building geometry, soil properties, selected foundation system
    and earthquake loads. The influence of these factors is taken into account during
    the design and construction of structures and the seismic performance of the structure
    is improved by taking appropriate measures. Local soil effects play an important
    role in earthquake resistant building design. For example, in the 2023 Kahramanmaras
    earthquake of magnitude 7.7 and 7.6, buildings were severely damaged due to soil.
    As a result of the examination of the damaged buildings, it was observed that
    the soil-foundation-structure relationship was not established properly. One of
    the most prominent features of the collapsed buildings is the low bearing capacity
    of the soils on which the foundations sit. Within the scope of this study, how
    the soil type, soil structure and the properties of the selected foundation system
    affect the behaviour of the structure is investigated. By considering soil-structure
    interaction, how the structure will behave on the appropriate soil and determination
    of the foundation system suitable for the soil are emphasised. The foundation
    system of the building is selected by considering the soil classes and the requirements
    of the 2018 Turkey Building Earthquake Code are taken into consideration. A sample
    building modelling was carried out by making calculations and simulations were
    made in IDECAD programme. In this way, it is aimed to reveal the relationship
    between the soil and the structure in a healthy way.</em>
