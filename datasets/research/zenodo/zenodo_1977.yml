  title: Impacts Of Soil Contamination On The Response Of Piles Foundation Under A
    Combination Of Loading
  abstract: "The behavior of single piles driven into contaminated clayey soil samples\
    \ subjected to a combination of static axial and cyclic lateral loadings have\
    \ been studied in this research. A laboratory model was manufactured especially\
    \ for studying such behavior. A solid circular cross sectional area pile of diameter\
    \ 19 mm and made from aluminum, the pile was embedded into the soil with an eccentricity\
    \ to embedded length (e/L) ratio of 0.334. The intact soil samples and industrial\
    \ wastewater were obtained from the center of Iraq. The industrial wastewater\
    \ is a byproduct disposed from Musayib thermal electric power plant. The intact\
    \ clayey soil samples were synthetically contaminated with four percentages of\
    \ 10, 20, 40 and 100% from the weight of water used in the soaking process which\
    \ continued for a period of 30 days. The different percentages of contaminant\
    \ concentrations have significant effects on the lateral load-displacement relation\
    \ of the piles subjected to a combination of axial and lateral loadings. The vertical\
    \ displacement under the same vertical load increased by 5\u201395%, the axial\
    \ strength of piles decreased by 10\u201334% and the lateral-bearing capacity\
    \ of the piles decreased by 10\u201334% with increasing the percentage of contamination\
    \ from 10 to 100%. The ratio of permanent lateral displacement to the total lateral\
    \ displacement was increased by 23\u201327% when the concentration of contaminant\
    \ increased by 10-100%. Generally, the application of axial loading increases\
    \ the lateral-bearing capacity of piles, and reduces the total lateral displacement."
