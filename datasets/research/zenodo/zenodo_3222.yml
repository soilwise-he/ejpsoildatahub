  title: EFFECT OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF COHESION LESS SOILS AND PILE DIAMETERS
    ON THE BEHAVIOR OF SOIL COLUMN INSIDE THE OPEN ENDED PIPE PILES UNDER DIFFERENT
    SATURATION CONDITIONS
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;This research is conducted to study the effect different grain\
    \ size distribution of cohesionless soils (i.e. fine, medium and coarse sand)\
    \ \_and pipe pile diameters on the degree of soil plugging and plug length ratio\
    \ under different saturation conditions (i.e. fully and partially saturated).&lt;/p&gt;\n\
    \n&lt;p&gt;\_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karbala sand, were used as a natural soil\
    \ in the present study, it is poorly graded clean sand of rounded particles. The\
    \ sandy soil is sieved to obtain a fine, medium and coarse graded according to\
    \ (ASTM D 422-02)[3].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\_&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experimental\
    \ model tests conducted on four open-ended steel pipe pile models with diameters\
    \ of (25, 30, 35 and 41mm). embedded within different grain size distribution\
    \ of sand prepared under fully and partially saturated conditions with predermined\
    \ relative density of 65%. The unsaturated states were achieved by lowering of\
    \ water table according to predetermined matric suction values of soils. The relationship\
    \ between matric suction and depth of ground water table was measured in suction\
    \ profile set by using three Tensiometers (IRROMETER). The soil, water characteristic\
    \ curve (SWCC) was estimated by applying fitting methods through the program (Soil\
    \ Vision).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The results shows that, the plug length ratio\
    \ (PLR) (The proportion of a soil plug length to the pile penetration depth) which\
    \ was measured for different pile diameters, and different grain size distribution\
    \ in unsaturated conditions, for the same pipe pile diameter increase with increasing\
    \ the matric suction values and the length of soil column inside the pipe pile\
    \ increase gradually with the increasing of a piles diameter.&lt;/p&gt;"
