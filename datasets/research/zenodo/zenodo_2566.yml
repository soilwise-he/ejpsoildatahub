  title: Effects of biochar and wood ash amendments in the soil-water-plant environment
    of two temperate forest plantations
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Forest biomass is considered an alternative to fossil fuels in energy
    production, as part of global strategies for climate change mitigation. Application
    of by-products such as wood ash (WA) and biochar (BC) to soil could replace the
    nutrients removed by tree harvesting and could also increase soil carbon stocks.
    However, the extent to which these amendments can provide benefits depends on
    how the by-products interact with the soil-water-plant system. We studied the
    short-term responses of WA and BC application in two different mineral soil-water-plant
    systems in temperate forests: A. Typic Udorthent (TU) with mature Pinus radiata;
    B. Typic Dystrudept (TD) with young Quercus pyrenaica, to test the following hypotheses:
    (1) the application of WA and BC will increase nutrient uptake by plants, but
    (2) these products could induce toxicity in the soil-water-plant system, and (3)
    in case of no toxicity, plant biomass growth in these temperate forest soils will
    increase due to increased plant nutrient uptake. Biochar was applied at rates
    of 3.5, 10, and 20 Mg ha&ndash;1 and WA at rates of 1.5, 4.5, and 9 Mg ha&ndash;1
    (calcium equivalent). A nitrogen enriched treatment was applied with the intermediate
    doses. Ecotoxicity testing indicated that WA and BC were not toxic, although Ni
    uptake increased in biomass of the TU after BC + N application. BC increased SOC
    stocks of both sites, depending on treatment. In TD BC increased K uptake by plants,
    but did not increase biomass. In summary, this study shows that the application
    of BC and WA had different effects on the soil -water-plant system in two different
    forest soils. This difference was attributed to (i) the soil characteristics,
    (ii) the application rates and (iii) whether or not nitrogen was applied. Long-term
    field experiments are required to test the performance and potential toxicity
    of these by-products as soil enhancers. Copyright &copy; 2023 Moragues-Saitua,
