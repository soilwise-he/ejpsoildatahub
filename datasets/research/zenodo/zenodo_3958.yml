  title: Comparison Of Artificial Neural Network And Multivariate Regression Methods
    In Prediction Of Soil Cation Exchange Capacity
  abstract: 'Investigation of soil properties like Cation Exchange

    Capacity (CEC) plays important roles in study of environmental

    reaserches as the spatial and temporal variability of this property

    have been led to development of indirect methods in estimation of

    this soil characteristic. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) provide an

    alternative by estimating soil parameters from more readily available

    soil data. 70 soil samples were collected from different horizons of

    15 soil profiles located in the Ziaran region, Qazvin province, Iran.

    Then, multivariate regression and neural network model (feedforward

    back propagation network) were employed to develop a

    pedotransfer function for predicting soil parameter using easily

    measurable characteristics of clay and organic carbon. The

    performance of the multivariate regression and neural network model

    was evaluated using a test data set. In order to evaluate the models,

    root mean square error (RMSE) was used. The value of RMSE and

    R2 derived by ANN model for CEC were 0.47 and 0.94 respectively,

    while these parameters for multivariate regression model were 0.65

    and 0.88 respectively. Results showed that artificial neural network

    with seven neurons in hidden layer had better performance in

    predicting soil cation exchange capacity than multivariate regression.'
