  title: 'THE SOIL SCIENCE &amp;amp; ARCHAEO-GEOPHYSICS ALLIANCE (SAGA): going beyond
    prospection'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Archaeological sites can be discovered and recorded in a high-resolution\
    \ and non-invasive manner using geophysical methods. These measure the spatial\
    \ variation of a range of physical properties of the soil which may be representative\
    \ proxies of the subsurface archaeology. Less-invasive and cost-effective field\
    \ procedures have become top-priority to mitigate the destructive effects on our\
    \ cultural heritage from intensified land use, climate change and the current\
    \ conflict panorama.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;At a time when many organisations are\
    \ investing in advanced geophysical equipment, a major problem is that our ability\
    \ to fully interpret the information available from geophysical datasets is still\
    \ very limited. This deficiency prevents geophysical survey moving beyond basic\
    \ prospection and becoming a significant tool for answering nuanced questions\
    \ about archaeology and their host landscapes. This limitation arises from an\
    \ incomplete understanding of the relationship between soil properties and geophysical\
    \ measurements. Bridging this gap requires multi-disciplinary teams, testing novel\
    \ methods, plus scholarly discussion to collate the outcomes of projects on this\
    \ topic. Overcoming these challenges is a prerequisite for maximising the costeffectiveness\
    \ of geophysical methods, realising the expected benefits of technological investment\
    \ and allowing broader utility of geophysical methods in the cultural heritage\
    \ sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;SAGA will build an international network of geophysicists,\
    \ archaeologists, soil scientists and other experts to develop our capability\
    \ to interpret geophysical data and promote research collaborations. Our vision\
    \ is that after four years, SAGA will have created an environment within which\
    \ emerging field procedures, enhanced data interpretation and a broader understanding\
    \ of integrated geophysical methods can flourish.&lt;/p&gt;"
