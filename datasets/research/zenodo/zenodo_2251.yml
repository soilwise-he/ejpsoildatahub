  title: Effects of Forest and Rangeland on Interception, Evapotranspiration, Soil
    Moisture and Ground water, Infiltration-a review
  abstract: "Land use types and practices significantly influence hydrological properties.\
    \ The hydrological properties like interception, infiltration, soil moisture and\
    \ evapotranspiration varies with vegetation cover, topography, climatic conditions\
    \ and soil properties. These properties don\u2019t have exact value for all areas\
    \ i.e. they can have different values under same vegetation cover. The purpose\
    \ of the study was to understand the effects of forest and rangeland/grasslands\
    \ on various hydrological properties like interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration,\
    \ soil moisture and ground water recharge. Interception and evapotranspiration\
    \ were higher from woody vegetation due to aerodynamics roughness of trees in\
    \ promoting increased evaporation in wet condition that the rate of evapotranspiration\
    \ losses from forests and grassland were 1400 \xB1 100 mm yr\u22121 and 950 \xB1\
    \ 50 mm yr\u22121 respectively. Soil moisture was found higher in area with small\
    \ bulk density and higher abundance of pore spaces that some studies found moisture\
    \ under grassland twice that under forest and some found higher moisture on forest\
    \ with good management practices than in grassland. Ground water was found increased\
    \ when forests were converted to rangelands; groundwater recharge would increase\
    \ by 7.8 \xB1 12.6%. Well managed forest land with coarse medium texture soil\
    \ has higher infiltration capacity than grassland and bare ground. Study found\
    \ mean cumulative infiltration 33.47 cm in forest and 8.4 cm in grassland. Different\
    \ vegetation structure and their management practices impacts soil, climate and\
    \ water cycle differently. So, it is very important to understand which vegetation\
    \ type can be used in particular area. This study will help to understand the\
    \ hydrological influence of woody and herbaceous plants and helps in practicing\
    \ better land use practice in water related disaster vulnerable areas."
