  title: Rice production threatened by coupled stresses of climate and soil arsenic
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Projections of global rice yields account for climate change.
    They do not, however, considerthe coupled stresses of impending climate change
    and arsenic in paddy soils. Here, we showin a greenhouse study that future conditions
    cause a greater proportion of pore-waterarsenite, the more toxic form of arsenic,
    in the rhizosphere of CalifornianOryza sativaL.variety M206, grown on Californian
    paddy soil. As a result, grain yields decrease by 39%compared to yields at today&rsquo;s
    arsenic soil concentrations. In addition, future climatic con-ditions cause a
    nearly twofold increase of grain inorganic arsenic concentrations. Ourfindingsindicate
    that climate-induced changes in soil arsenic behaviour and plant response will
    lead tocurrently unforeseen losses in rice grain productivity and quality. Pursuing
    rice varieties andcrop management practices that alleviate the coupled stresses
    of soil arsenic and change inclimatic factors are needed to overcome the currently
    impending food crisis.&lt;/p&gt;'
