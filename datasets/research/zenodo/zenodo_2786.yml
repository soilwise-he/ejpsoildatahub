  title: Study on Land Use Activities and Their Effects on Soil Erosion on the Slopes
    of Kajulu Hills, Kisumu County, Kenya
  abstract: Soil erosion is a natural phenomenon, but human activities accelerate
    it between ten to forty times the natural occurrences. It therefore calls for
    mitigating measure to curb the effects of erosion since soils form at a slower
    rate than they are destroyed. A study on land use activities and their effects
    on soil erosion was conducted in the upland ecosystem in Kenya, Kajulu hills.
    The study assessed the effectiveness of the mitigation measures adopted by the
    residents to ease the effects erosion on the hill slopes. A sample size of 295
    households out of 1600 households engaged in various mitigating practices was
    used. The study collected data on the magnitude of soil (kg) lost from the arable
    lands using collector ditch technique. The data were analyzed using frequency
    distribution tables and Man U-test. The result showed a double amount (1.198 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
    of soil lost on the arable land without mitigation measures as compared to plots
    under cut off ditches (0.615 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and vegetative strips (0.904 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
    with Man U=7. These findings were above the world wide estimation of soil erosion
    on arable mountainous regions which range between 1.3-40.kg/m<sup>2</sup>/year
    (13-40T/Ha/year) as it was based on one rainy season. The findings showed that
    the mitigation measures adopted by the farmers to check the effects of soil erosion
    were effective with Man U=7 under the cut off ditches and vegetative strips.
