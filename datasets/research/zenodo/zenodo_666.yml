  title: Effectiveness of Different Chemicals on Stabilization of Expansive Soil
  abstract: Significant damage and distortions in the supporting structures are caused
    due to the volume fluctuation resulting from the moisture change of the expansive
    soil. To achieve the post-construction stability standards, sufficient performance
    improvement of expansive soil is necessary. Chemical soil stabilization is one
    of the preferred methods utilized across the world. The efficiency of several
    chemical stabilizers (e.g., lime, fly ash, BaCl2, CaCl2, and MgCl2) in enhancing
    the engineering properties of expansive soils are examined in this work considering
    the Atterberg limit test and the unconfined compressive strength test. The liquid
    limit of the expansive soil rises as the stabilizer content increase. However,
    when CaCl2 levels increases, the liquid limit of the expansive soil decreases.
    A maximum increment of the liquid limit of the soil sample is observed for 2%
    lime addition. However, the liquid limit decreases when the lime or fly ash content
    of the soil sample exceeds 5 to 6%. Soil plastic limit normally increases with
    lime or fly ash addition (up to 5%) and reduces with salt content inclusion. Unconfined
    compressive strength of the expansive soil increases with increase in stabilizer
    contents. The expansive soil sample's unconfined compressive strength increases
    as the stabilizer content increases.
