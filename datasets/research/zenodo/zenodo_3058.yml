  title: Pedotransfer Functions for Cation Exchange Capacity, Available Water Holding
    Capacity and Soil Organic Carbon for Representative Soils of Southern Highland
    Zone of Tanzania
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT: Pedotransfer functions are useful tools in estimating the not
    easily measured and expensive soil properties. They are especially valuable in
    settings such as the SHZT where limited direct soil measurements are available.
    The objective of this study was to develop a series of pedotransfer functions
    and then evaluate which ones best estimate cation exchange capacity (CEC), available
    water holding capacity (AWHC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Data from 20 horizons
    of four representative pedons was used to evaluate the most predictive properties.
    Best fit multiple linear regressions were used to obtain relationships and identify
    property coefficients. Examples of pedotransfer functions developed for the SHZT
    are %SOC = 0.1*hue-0.03*value0.034chroma (n = 20, r2 = 0.74), CEC (meq/100g) =
    0.44*%clay + 9.6%SOC (n=20, r2 = 0.93), and, AWHC (mm/m) = 14.7%SOC + 0.82%clay
    + 0.35%silt + 0.51%sand (n=12; r2 = 0.96). All color attributes are for moist
    samples. The results of predicted CEC, AWHC, and SOC were compared to those measured
    in the laboratory using the t-test, and the two methods did not differ significantly;
    two-sided p-value=0.93. These results indicate the promising potential of using
    the easily measured soil properties and cheap in fiscal terms to estimate the
    not easily measured soil properties.'
