  title: "\uFEFFThe spiral of plants and soil in the cycle of life"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This is not an article, but rather an account of a meeting that
    took place between two naturalists who had not seen each other for a few years
    and who freely exchanged their doubts and matured lines of thought. It is a provocative
    dialogue between the author of this article and Sandro Pignatti on natural evolution,
    considering the soil as a living matrix in which recycling of organic matter (including
    DNA) takes place. We can also interpret it as an attempt to merge the points of
    view of vegetation and soil ecologists, in order to revive the discussion on natural
    evolution. We think we understand it, but we don''t. We discussed the following
    topics: 1) the relationship between phytosociology and plant ecology; 2) the soil
    as an individual or as an ecosystem''s digestive machinery; 3) the hypothesis
    of a complemental geological (long-term) flow of DNA fragments in relation to
    the recycling process that takes place in the soil. Past and recent research in
    the fields of biology and evolution highlights a functional and primordial collaboration
    between living beings in the exploitation of natural resources. In this process
    that ultimately is life, soil plays a crucial role because it is cyclically and
    progressively renewed and enriches the sources of structural building blocks.
    The purpose of this story is to encourage us to reflect on the meaning of life,
    considering the functional contribution of death, which we perhaps mistakenly
    call "biodegradation".&lt;/p&gt;'
