  title: Selected physical and chemical properties of soil under different agricultural
    land-use types in Ile-Ife, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study examined changes in soil properties under different
    types of agricultural land-use. This was done with a view to extending knowledge
    on the nature of soil properties under long-term land-use practices. The study
    investigated six types of land-use: paddock, continuously cropped, secondary forest,
    teak, oil palm, and cacao plantations. Soil strength and saturated hydraulic conductivity
    were determined in-situ at two soil depths (0&ndash;15 and 15&ndash;30 cm) across
    the land-use types. Soil samples were collected to determine particle size distribution,
    bulk density, aggregate stability, pH, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity,
    total nitrogen, and available phosphorus. The data obtained were subjected to
    analysis of variance and Duncan&#39;s multiple range test was used to separate
    significant means at p  0.05. The results showed that land-use types such as forest,
    cacao and continuously cropped had higher saturated hydraulic conductivity, while
    soil bulk density was highest under continuously cropped land-use type (1.55 g
    cm3). The soil aggregates of forest, teak, and oil palm land-use types were more
    stable, but soil under oil palm land-use had the highest soil strength (5.65 kg
    m2). Soil pH across the land-use types was slightly acidic to strongly acidic,
    while soil organic carbon was least in continuously cropped land (3.87 g kg1).
    The total nitrogen content of soil across the land-use types was high, but the
    available phosphorus was low. Paddock, cacao, and continuously cropped land-use
    types had higher cation exchange capacity. The results implied that continuous
    cultivation led to depletion in soil physical and chemical properties, whereas,
    afforestation and cultivation of tree crops conserved soil properties better.
    Therefore, the establishment of tree crop plantations and conservative soil management
    practices such as manuring, mulching, liming, and conservation tillage were suggested
    to prevent agricultural lands from degradation in areas with soils under similar
    conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
