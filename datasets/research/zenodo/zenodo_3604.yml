  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;One approach is proposed for the application of high-resolution
    aerospace images in soil science. The&lt;br&gt;

    process of soil salinization in the pilot area of the Kura-Araks lowland is investigated.
    For the 1st time,&lt;br&gt;

    an analysis of spectral curves based on data from four channels of the AzerSky
    satellite and an extended&lt;br&gt;

    range of wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum based on eight-channel satellite
    WorldView-2&lt;br&gt;

    is given for this territory. The analysis of spectral curves and the use of other
    methods (calculation&lt;br&gt;

    of indices, filtration, the principal component method, and classification) made
    it possible to more&lt;br&gt;

    accurately separate soils with varying degrees of salinity and reveal features
    of the course of the spectral&lt;br&gt;

    curves of soils and vegetation on areas saline to varying degrees.&lt;/p&gt;'
