  title: 'Aspegillus terreus: From Soil to Industry and Back'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus terreus &lt;/em&gt;is an important saprophytic
    filamentous fungus that can be found in soils. Like many other soil microorganisms,
    &lt;em&gt;A. terreus &lt;/em&gt;demonstrates multiple functions and offers various
    important metabolites, which can be used in different fields of human activity.
    The first application of &lt;em&gt;A. terreus &lt;/em&gt;on an industrial level
    is the production of itaconic acid, which is now considered as one of the most
    important bioproducts in the Green Chemistry field. The general schemes for itaconic
    acid production have been studied, but in this mini-review some lines of future
    research are presented based on analysis of the published results. &lt;em&gt;A.
    terreus &lt;/em&gt;is also intensively studied for its biocontrol activity and
    plant growth-promoting effect. However, this microorganism is also known to infect
    important crops such as, amongst others, rice, wheat, potato, sugar cane, maize,
    and soybean. It was suggested, however, that the balance between positive vs.
    negative effects is dependent on the soil-plant-inoculant dose system. &lt;em&gt;A.
    terreus &lt;/em&gt;has frequently been described as an important human pathogen.
    Therefore, its safety manipulation in biotechnological processes for the production
    of itaconic acid and some drugs and its use in soil-plant systems should be carefully
    assessed. Some suggestions in this direction are discussed, particularly concerning
    the uses in crop production.&lt;/p&gt;'
