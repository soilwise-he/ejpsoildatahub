  title: IMPACT OF LONG-TERM FERTILIZATION ON YIELD IN WHEAT GROWN ON SOIL TYPE VERTISOL
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Experiments were carried out at stationary in Kragujevac, in Serbia,
    during the three growing seasons. The primary aim of the research was perceiving
    of the influence of long-term usage of the same amounts and rates of nitrogen,
    phosphorus and potassium on the yield and grain quality of winter wheat variety
    &bdquo;Kruna&ldquo;. Uptake NPK uptake by wheat ranged from 120 kg ha-1 nitrogen,
    from 60 to 100 kg ha-1 phosphorus and 60 kg ha-1 potassium, respectively, depending
    on treatments type. The grain yield of the wheat was significantly lower in control
    (treatment without fertilizer). The three-year grain yield of winter wheat was
    the highest in the NP1K and NP2K (4.367 and 4.531 t ha-1 ) treatments. In terms
    of investigated traits, particularly grain yield and test weight fertilizer expressed
    more efficiency in the 2014/2015. Variance analysis showed statistically very
    significant differences for grain yield, 1.000-grain weight and test weight between
    the vegetation seasons and very significant differences for grain yield and 1000-grain
    weight between the variants of fertilization. Variance analysis showed very significant
    differences for 1000-grain weight between the interaction of the vegetation seasons
    and variants of fertilization. It could be concluded that the grain yield in all
    treatments in the 2014/2015 growing season was significantly greater than in the
    other examined years, mostly as the result of highly favorable weather conditions
    at major stages of plant development wheat.&lt;/p&gt;'
