  title: 'Preprint: Topographic Wetness Index as a proxy for soil moisture: the importance
    of flow-routing algorithm and grid resolution'
  abstract: "The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) is a commonly used proxy for soil\
    \ moisture. The predictive capability of TWI is influenced by the flow-routing\
    \ algorithm and the resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) that TWI is\
    \ derived from. Here, we examine the predictive capability of TWI using 11 flow-routing\
    \ algorithms at DEM resolutions 1 - 30 m. We analyze the relationship between\
    \ TWI and field-quantified soil moisture using statistical modelling methods and\
    \ 5200 study plots with over 46 000 soil moisture measurements. In addition, we\
    \ test the sensitivity of the flow-routing algorithms against vertical height\
    \ errors in DEM at different resolutions. The results reveal that the overall\
    \ predictive capability of TWI was modest. The highest R2 (23.7%) was reached\
    \ using a multiple-flow-direction algorithm at 2 m resolution. In addition, the\
    \ test of sensitivity against height errors revealed that the multiple-flow-direction\
    \ algorithms were also more robust against DEM errors than single-flow-direction\
    \ algorithms. The results provide field-evidence indicating that at its best TWI\
    \ is a modest proxy for soil moisture and its predictive capability is influenced\
    \ by the flow-routing algorithm and DEM resolution. Thus, we encourage careful\
    \ evaluation of algorithms and resolutions when using TWI as a proxy for soil\
    \ moisture. Riihim\xE4ki, Kemppinen, Kopeck\xFD &amp; Luoto (Preprint). Topographic\
