  title: Constraining carbon and nutrient flows in soil with ecological stoichiometry
  abstract: 'The R code required to recreate the model analyses for the manuscript:
    "Constraining carbon and nutrient flows in soil with ecological stoichiometry."
    The model is written in the R package LIM and contains the model file (fullmodel_v4.lim)
    and the R code file that conducts the analysis (model_analysis_final.R). Three
    data files are provided. The file fundamental_biomeXecosystem_data.csv is a digital
    version of Table S2 in the manuscript and contains cross biome data. The file
    Qaio_etal_2019_Data.csv is a copy of the open access dataset with minor changes
    to match our analysis. The file srdb-data-V3.csv is a copy of the open access
    dataset SRBD. These latter two datasets are provided only for the convenience
    of the reader reproducing our analyses. Please refer to the original versions
    of these datasets and contact the original authors for all other inquiries/ uses.'
