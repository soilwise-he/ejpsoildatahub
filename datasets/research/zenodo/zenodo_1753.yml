  title: 'Soil Bioremediation in Heavy Metal Contaminated Mining Areas: A Microbiological/Biotechnological
    Point of View'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Bioremediation concerns the use of plants and microorganisms
    or their parts, for the decontamination and recuperation of polluted areas. The
    improvement of the bioremediation techniques is possible due to the last decade
    advances of the microbiological and biotechnological knowledge and methods. This
    study aimed to shortly review and discuss the bioremediation of mining areas contaminated
    with heavy metals focusing in some microbiological and biotechnological techniques.
    Strategies considered to be important on further studies are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;'
