  title: Effects of Different Planting Distance on Soil moisture content and Yield
    of Maize (Zea mays L.) in Tolon District of Northern Region, Ghana
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Rain-fed farming systems dominate Ghanaian agriculture, especially
    regarding the cultivation of major staples, such as maize, yam, cassava and rice.
    In this environment, farmers depend strongly on seasonal rains and every alteration
    in precipitation distribution affects their very livelihood. Recent threats of
    climate change aggravate the already delicate balance of food production and security.
    This research determined the effects different planting distance on soil moisture
    and yield of maize in Tolon District.&nbsp;Experimental plots were laid out in
    randomized complete block design (RCBD), with four replicates and four treatments.
    The four treatments comprising different planting distance: T1 (20 x 80 cm); T2
    (30 x 80 cm); T3 (40 x 80 cm) and T4 (50 x 80 cm), distributed randomly and independently
    in each plot. The size of each plot was 4 m by 5 m (20 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
    surrounded by bunds, with bund height of 10 cm, bottom width of 10 cm and top
    with of 5 cm. The space between plots was 1m. Soil moisture content was monitored
    using Tensiometers and Time Domain Reflectrometer, while non-weighing lysimeter
    used to establish the field water balance. Crop parameters monitored were plant
    height, number of leaves, days to 50 % tasseling and maturity, LAI, grain and
    biomass yields. The results indicated that there was significant difference for
    yield and yield-related parameters, but not on soil moisture content when maize
    was planted at four different planting distances. This suggested that planting
    distance has effects on maize yield but not&nbsp;soil moisture content. Maximum
    soil and air temperatures were within the optimum range for rain-fed maize production
    in the Tolon District during the field experiment. Soil moisture content was at
    either field capacity or near saturation throughout the various growth stages
    of maize, with only small amount of water lost to deep percolation. Planting at
    20 cm by 80 cm distance had a higher yield, compared to the rest of the treatments.
    Maize famers should adopt that planting distance to maximise yield. Farmers should
    also be advised to start planting of maize in July, to escape the effect of early
    season drought on crop establishment and growth.&lt;/p&gt;'
