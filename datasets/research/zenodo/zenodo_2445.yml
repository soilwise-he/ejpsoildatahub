    <em>Manuscript received online 01 December 2018, revised 25 April 2018, accepted
    22 May 2019</em> A laboratory experiment was conducted to study the effect of
    a drying phase on transformation of different fractions of K in a continuously
    flooded limed and the corresponding unlimed soil in presence and absence of N
    and K fertilizers. Results of the investigation revealed that irrespective of
    treatments, water soluble K decreased significantly with increase in the period
    of incubation. Liming and maintenance of a drying phase intensified the decrease
    of water soluble K in waterlogged acid soil. Addition of N along with K disturbs
    the K-equilibrium in soil as both K<sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>
    compete for the same exchange sites. The increase in exchangeable K and concomitant
    decrease in non-exchangeable K in limed soil suggests a dynamic equilibrium between
    these two forms of K in soil. Maintenance of a drying phase in presence of N and
    K fertilizers released non-exchangeable K in limed soil. However, treatment of
    limed soil with 1 N boiling HNO<sub>3</sub> released more K in presence of only
    K than N plus K fertilizers. Changes in lattice K followed exactly an opposite
    trend of results with respect to non-exchangeable and 1 N boiling HNO<sub>3</sub>
    extractable K, which again suggests a dynamic equilibrium between them. Total
    K is not significantly influenced due to liming and maintenance of a drying phase
    in waterlogged acid soil over 90-day period of incubation.
