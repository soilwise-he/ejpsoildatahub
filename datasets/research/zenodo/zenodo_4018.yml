  title: Comparative Study on the Stabilization of Three Southwestern Lateritic Soil
    for Road Work using Pulverized Cow Bone (PCB)
  abstract: '- This paper investigates on the possibility of improving and comparing
    the engineering properties of three samples of lateritic soil from Ogun, Oyo and
    Osun with pulverized cow bone, a processed animal waste obtained from abattoirs,
    for road construction. The effect of PCB on the soil samples was assessed by adding
    2-8% PCB at a 2% increment to the lateritic soil. The Atterberg limits(Liquid
    limit, Plastic limit, Plasticity Index) obtained were Ogun ( 57%, 21.16%, 35.84%),
    Oyo (51.4%, 25.19%, 26.21%) and Osun (29.4%, 14.68%, 14.72%). The high plasticity
    index of the Ogun state soil shows that the soil may be susceptible to cracking
    and shrinkage. Although the strength properties, California Bearing Ratio and
    Unconfined Compressive Strength of all the samples improved with increment in
    PCB additive from 0 - 8% PCB achieving the following peak (Soaked CBR, UCS) values
    with PCB stabilization; Ogun(15%, 93.37%), Oyo(19.65%, 95.19) and Osun(18%, 171.315%),
    the compaction result did not concur with the endless addition of PCB to the lateritic
    samples.'
