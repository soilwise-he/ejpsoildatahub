  title: 'Use of Agro-Energy Waste as Agricultural Inputs: Impact on Soil Bacterial
    Diversity'
  abstract: 'Waste reuse is a very interesting option from an economic, environmental,
    and often a social point of view. However, it is important to assess the impact
    of their use on soil characteristics to optimize proper dosages. Because microbial
    diversity can be used as one of the indicators of soil quality; we aimed to evaluate
    soil bacterial diversity after using combinations of gravel (waste from drilling
    in the petroleum industry) and Crambe press-cake (a by-product of biodiesel production)
    in haplic planosol cultivated with sunflowers (Helianthus annus l.) using a culture-independent
    technique, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Analysis of variance
    showed that the use of gravel and Crambe press cake at doses tested in haplic
    planosol did not significantly affect soil microbial diversity. This wastes had
    no significant effect on the number of bands obtained using DGGE. Besides, dynamics
    of the bacterial population did not follow any other parameter, such as chemical
    parameters, evaluated in the study, confirming that changes in the chemical characteristics
    of the soil due to the application of the wastes did not affect bacterial diversity.
    The results indicate that the use of these wastes is environmentally safe and
    that higher sodium content did not affect soil bacteria diversity.Read Complete
