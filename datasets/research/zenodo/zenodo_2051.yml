  title: Analysis of Seepage Beneath a Sheet Pile Wall in Homogeneous Soil by Finite
    Element method
  abstract: Department of Civil Engineering, Haldia Institute of Technology, West
    Bengal, India An analytical method was followed to find flow characteristics,
    like flow rate, exit gradient that are to be determined for seepage through a
    uniform and homogeneous soil. The finite element program, SEEP/W was introduced
    to analyze flow characteristics of a sheet pile wall a homogeneous soil. Extensive
    analyses were performed for different conditions, including soil layer thickness,
    soil hydraulic conductivity and sheet pile wall depth. The flow rate and exit
    gradient were determined for each condition analyzed. The analysis can help a
    designer to get solutions to the seepage problem. The results were depicted in
    simple charts. The method was verified by comparing the results with those obtained
    from SEEP/W program, and good agreement was noted.
