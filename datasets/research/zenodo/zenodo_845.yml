  title: Contemporary Aspects of Soil Eco-Chemistry and Geochemistry in Bulgaria
  abstract: 'The paper focuses on the main aspects of contemporary soil eco-chemistry
    in Bulgaria. The issues tackled refer to: (i) analysis of chemical species, including
    contaminants; (ii) prediction of metal bioavailability and exposure to plants
    of chemical species in soil. A stress is made on pilot studies concerning organic
    geochmical markers, their analysis and quantification in soils (Fluvisols, Vertisols,
    Luvisols, Arenosols). A new aspect of soil eco-chemistry is related with analysis
    of compounds in water-soluble dissolved organic carbon in soil as molecular indicators
    of environmental change.'
