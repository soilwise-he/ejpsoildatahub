  title: Usability of enzyme activity in estimation of forest soil quality
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the progressive degradation of soils it
    is important to assess their quality. Soil quality depends on a large number of
    physical, chemical, biological and biochemical properties. In the publications
    available, there are presented three approaches regarding the use of soil properties
    to estimate soil quality: (1) the use of individual properties, (2) the use of
    simple indexes and (3) the use of complex indexes derived from combinations of
    different properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility
    to use enzymes as indicators of forest soil quality. Experimental plots (43) were
    located in central Poland. The study was carried out in a number of diverse fresh
    forest sites. To assess the quality of forest soils dehydrogenase and urease activity
    and the degree of base saturation were used. One of the final conclusions point
    out that enzymatic activity indicates current site condition as well as the changes
    that occur in soil better than soil physical and chemical properties. In other
    words, in&lt;br /&gt;

    comparison to soil enzymatic activity, soil physico-chemical properties constitute
    a less sensitive indicator of soil changes.&lt;/p&gt;'
