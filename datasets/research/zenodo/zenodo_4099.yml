  title: Input Analysis Using Soil Classification Techniques And Predicting Its Evolution
    In Morocco Oriental To Conversion Wheat/Olive At Horizon 2020
  abstract: 'Agronomic and pastoral research in East Morocco depend an evolution in
    time and space of the soil which is an important factor otherwise, limiting plant
    cover.


    Thus, a chemical and physicochemical soil study was assisted by advanced techniques
    such as data mining. Today, data exploitation on a global scale are used in a
    large number of vast agribusiness operating areas. Products of computer operating
    systems and specific domain data extrapolation are applicable across disciplines,
    however they are still relatively new on agricultural . Hence a lack of bibliographic
    data is recorded.


    This research aims to analyze soil data using classification techniques. It focuses
    on soil classification using various algorithms'
