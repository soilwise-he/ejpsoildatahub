  title: Application of Geotechnics in Soil Survey and Land Evaluation
  abstract: Extensive and reliable information on soil and land resources are prerequisites
    for efficient and effective management planning of these vital natural resources.
    The information on soils with regard to their nature, physico-chemical characteristics
    and spatial distribution is of paramount importance in formulating any optimal
    land use plan. Generation of large-scale spatial database on soil and land resources
    by conventional method is a time consuming and highly expensive process. The application
    of Remote Sensing Technology has been universally recognized as a highly effective
    and inevitable tool for soil resource mapping and watershed management. Indian
    Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data are being extensively used for soil resource-mapping
    purposes. It is found to be superior over topographical map for soil mapping.
    The Standard False Color Composite (FCC), satellite imagery on 1:50,000 scale
    widely being used for soil resource inventory in semi-detail and reconnaissance
    survey (Karale et al. 1991). However, with the availability of high resolution
    PAN (5.8 m) and LISS III (23 m) data from IRS-1C/1D satellites and multispectral
    high resolution (5.8 m) data from Resourcesat (IRS- P6) satellite , it is now
    possible to utilize these data for large-scale soil mapping, i.e. up to 1:12,500
    scale for village-level planning. Cartosat-1 with 2.5 m spatial resolution and
    Cartosat-2 satellites (to be launched) with better than 1 m spatial resolution
    will be quite useful to generate larger scale soil maps.
