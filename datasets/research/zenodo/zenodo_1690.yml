  title: Experimental Study on Properties of Black Cotton Soil Mixed Stone Dust and
    Sisal Fiber
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Experimental Studies were conducted to see the effects on strength
    behavior of Black cotton soil using stone dust and Sisal fiber. In this study,
    the stabilizing effect of sisal Fiber Natural Fiber on soil properties. Keeping
    this in view an experimental study is conducted on locally available i.e. expensive
    soil mixed with varying percentage of Stone dust and Sisal fiber. Soil samples
    for California bearing ratio CBR tests are prepared at its maximum dry density
    MDD corresponding to its optimum moisture content OMC in the CBR mould without
    and with sisal fiber. Tests result indicates that both unsoaked and soaked CBR
    value of soil increases with the increase. Soaked CBR value increases from 3.97
    to 9.75 and un soaked CBR value increases from 8.1 to 40.7 of soil mixed with
    stone dust and sisal fiber. Due to sisal fiber reinforcement CBR is increased
    resulting lesser thickness of pavements are used in construction works. Soil becomes
    ductile in nature. This is because of composite effect of sisal fibre Natural
    Fibre changes the brittle behavior of the soil to ductile behavior. Wankhade Ashutosh
