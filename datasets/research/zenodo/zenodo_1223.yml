  title: 'Cellulosimicrobium funkei: A Novel Bacterium in Potassium Solubilization
    from Soil in Bangalore'
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> Potassium (K) is a very\
    \ essential element needed by plants for healthy growth and good yield. Most soils\
    \ have abundance of potassium underneath in rock as insoluble forms that are unavailable\
    \ for plant use. This research was carried out to join in the search to unearth\
    \ microorganisms from the rhizosphere soil that are able to act on the mineral\
    \ containing substances, solubilizing them to release the needed soluble form\
    \ of the potassium for plant use. An isolate, which was characterized and identified\
    \ to be Cellulosimicrobium funkei, showed significant solubilization on feldspar\
    \ (a potassium containing compound) supplemented media. It is novel for potassium\
    \ solubilization. The amount of potassium released by the isolate in comparison\
    \ to reference cultures varied but favourably compared with the reference cultures.\
    \ In glucose amended broth, solubilization was: Cellulosimicrobium funkei 7.04mg/l,\
    \ Enterobacter hormaechei 7.15 mg/l and 6.91mg/l for Aspergillus terreus. Urea\
    \ supplemented broth: Cellulosimicrobium funkei 5.45mg/l, Enterobacter hormaechei\
    \ 5.38mg/l and Aspergillus terreus 6.33mg/l. KCl supplemented broth: Cellulosimicrobium\
    \ funkei 10.23mg/l, Enterobacter hormaechei 8.05mg/l and Aspergillus terreus 9.11mg/l.\
    \ For temperature, the cultures solubilized best at these respective temperatures:\
    \ Cellulosimicrobium funkei 27<sup>o</sup>C, Enterobacter hormaechei 35<sup>o</sup>C\
    \ and Aspergillus terreus 30<sup>o</sup>C. P<sup>H</sup> was 7.5 for Cellulosimicrobium\
    \ funkei, 8 for Enterobacter hormaechei and for 7.5 for Aspergillus terreus. When\
    \ they were now cultured using the combination of the above parameters Cellulosimicrobium\
    \ funkei, Enterobacter hormaechei and Aspergillus terreus gave a maximum yield\
    \ of 7.24mg/l, 7.03mg/l and 6.81mg/l of solubilized potassium respectively. This\
    \ means that the isolate Cellulosimicrobium funkei yielded more solubilized potassium\
    \ from feldspar than the reference cultures and could therefore be a better potassium\
    \ solubilizer."
