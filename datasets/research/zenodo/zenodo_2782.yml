  title: Variation in Soil Temperature Amid COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Mid Hills
    of Rajouri and Jammu Districts, J&amp;K, India
  abstract: <strong>Aim:</strong> A preliminary analysis was done to evaluate the
    impact of lockdown on soil temperature at different depths and comparison with
    year 2018 and 2019. <strong>Methodology and Results:</strong> In order to describe
    the basic features of the data in study, descriptive statistics method was opted.
    The deviation in soil temperature in Rajouri District from mean value at 5 cm
    depth observed during lockdown was -8.58% and -4.77% compared to year 2018 and
    2019. However the deviation observed from mean value at 10 cm depth was -10.72%
    and -9.28%. The deviation from mean value at 20 cm depth observed was -2.34% and
    -1.98%. The average change in soil temperature in Jammu District in morning at
    5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm depth was -3.46%, -3.84% and -7.23% as compared to year
    2019 (22nd March to 10th June 2019) mean value and the change in soil temperature
    in evening at same depths was -7.69%, -6.31% and -4.14% from year 2019 (22nd March
    to 10th June 2019). The much focus is on Rajouri District as compared to Jammu,
    so tables and figures are representing Rajouri situation. <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
    The study concluded that due to lockdown, there was significant change in soil
    temperature values at variable depths compared to year 2018 and 2019 in the study
    region.
