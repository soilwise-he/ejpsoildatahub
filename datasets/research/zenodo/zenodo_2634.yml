  title: 'Cryoconites as biogeochemical markers of anthropogenic impact in high mountain
    regions: analysis of polyaromatic pollutants in soil-like bodies'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The globalisation and omnidirectional character of anthropogenic\
    \ processes has challenged scientists around the world to estimate the harmful\
    \ effects of these processes on ecosystems and human health. Polycyclic aromatic\
    \ hydrocarbons (PAHs) is one the most infamous group of contaminants, originated\
    \ both from natural and anthropogenic processes. They could transport to high\
    \ latitudes and altitudes through atmospheric long-distance transfer and further\
    \ enter ecosystems of these vulnerable regions by deposition on terrestrial surfaces.\
    \ An interesting object for tracking transboundary contamination processes in\
    \ high mountain ecosystems is called cryoconite. Cryoconite, a dark-coloured supraglacial\
    \ sediment which is abundant in polar and mountain environments, is considered\
    \ as a storage of various pollutants, including PAHs. Thus, it may pose a risk\
    \ for local human health and ecosystem through short-distance transfer. Studied\
    \ cryoconite sediments were collected at the surface of Skhelda and Garabashi\
    \ glaciers, Central Caucasus high-mountain region, as well as mudflow, moraine\
    \ material and local soils at the Baksan Gorge in order to examine levels of their\
    \ contamination. We analysed the content of 15 priority polyaromatic compounds\
    \ from the US EPA list and used the method of calculation of PAHs isomer ratios\
    \ with the purpose of identifying their source. To estimate their potential toxicity,\
    \ Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) equivalents were calculated. Maximum concentration was\
    \ defined for NAP (84 ng\xD7g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), PHE (40 ng\xD7g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ and PYR (47 ng\xD7g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), with the minimum concentration\
    \ for ANT (about 1 ng\xD7g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). The most polluted material\
    \ is a cryoconite from Garabashi glacier because of local anthropogenic activities\
    \ and long-distance transfer. High-molecular weight PAHs are dominated in PAHs\
    \ composition of almost all samples. The most common sources of PAHs in studied\
    \ materials are combustion processes and mixed pyrolytic/petrogenic origin. Toxicity\
    \ levels of separate PAHs did not exceed the maximum permissible threshold concentrations\
    \ values in most cases. However, the sum of PAHs in BaP equivalents exceed the\
    \ threshold values in all samples, in some of them more than twice.&lt;/p&gt;"
