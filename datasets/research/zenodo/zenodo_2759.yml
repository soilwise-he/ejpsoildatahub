  title: Effect of Protection From Grazing on Perennial Vegetation Cover and Soil
    at Mislagun Area ,Southern Jebel Al-Akhdar , Libya
  abstract: This preliminary study was conducted under the supervision Faculty of
    Natural Resources and Envirmmental Sciences at Al-Maslogun Area, an arid rangeland,
    south of Jabal Al-Akhdar, Libya, to investigate the effects of protection of range
    land from grazing animals on the richness of perennial species, their density,
    cover, volume, and landscape function analysis, soil surface condition, and some
    other soil physical and chemical properties through comparisons between closed
    and open areas under similar topographic features. The study began from Feb. to
    Sep. 2008 .The W.A.R.M.S. technique was adopted in conducting this research. The
    results showed in general slightly higher species diversity inside the protected
    area with three species but no significant difference was found in wadi sites
    and upland sites between protected area and open area. The only difference observed
    was in sites located on slopes between the closed and open ranges. The total plant
    density did significantly differ in wadis between closed and open ranges. Hamada
    scoparia, Artemisia herba-alba ,and Anabasis articulata were more abundant in
    the closed area. On slopes, significant differences were found in total plant
    density compared with the upland and wadi sites in the two areas; The densities
    of Hamada and Artemisia were lower in the closed area. On the contrary, the density
    of Anabasis was more higher in the closed area. No differences were found in total
    plant cover for wadi and upland sites between closed and open areas. The cover
    percents of Hamada, Anabasis and Artemisia were higher in the closed range, especially
    on slopes. The number of overall mean volume classes of Hamada was higher in wadis
    of the closed range, while the number of all volume classes for this species was
    higher on slopes and upland sites of the open range. Mean while, the large volume
    classes of Anabasis was higher in the closed range and lower in the slopes and
    upland sites of the open range. For Artemisia, the numbers of volume classes in
    wadi sites were nearly equal for both closed and open areas. On the other hand,
    the numbers of overall volume classes ware higher on slopes of the closed range
    while they increased on upland sites of the open range . The indices of landscape
    function analysis and soil surface condition that includes stability, infiltration
    and nutrient cycling did not differ among different sites of the close range and
    open range. The statistical analysis results showed higher values of all edaphic
    physical properties studied in wadi sites between closed range and open range
    except the clay, silt, sand percents. However, no significant differences in soil
    physical properties values were observed on upland and slope sites of closed range
    than open range . No differences were found in the mean values of soil pH, E.C.,
    Soluble cations, anions, N, P,Cu, Mn, and Zn in all sites in closed and open study
    areas. The results of this study showed that the effect of protection from grazing
    on vegetation and landscape function and some soil properties are still limited
    to be of varient level ,probably because of the short duration of protection pericd
    which lasted two years, and the slow rate of growth of the perennial species,
    as well as the drought conditions prevailed and lead to these outcome . However,
    there is a general trend that may suggest that if the protection period was longer,
    the effects will be more pronounced .
