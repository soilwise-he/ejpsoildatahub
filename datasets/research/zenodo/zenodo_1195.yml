  title: Regional soil moisture prediction system based on Long Short-Term Memory
    network
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the context of climate change, drought has been recognised
    as one of the most severe threats for agricultural production since absence of
    water is one of the most limiting factors for the growth of plants. In this study,
    a regional system for soil moisture prediction based on ERA5 climate reanalysis
    dataset, an open-source meteorological dataset issued by Copernicus Climate Change
    Service, was developed. It consisted of the relevant meteorological parameters
    for Serbia, during the period 2011e2020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air
    temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features,
    and they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric soil
    moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was designed
    and trained at a regional scale using the data from the 2011-2016 period, at 28
    locations that cover four major soil types. Validation was done on 2017-2018 data
    and LSTM was compared with a statistical forecasting technique and a classical
    machine learning approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used
    in literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved to have
    good generalisation properties. The system was tested from September 2019 to April
    2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr service. It will present the cornerstone
    of the irrigation scheduling service in AgroSense.rs, the Serbian national platform
    for digital agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;'
