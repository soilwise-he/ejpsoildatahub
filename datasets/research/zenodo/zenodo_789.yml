  title: SOIL LIQUEFACTION POTENTIAL STUDYING IN THE SOUTH OF URMIA PLAIN
  abstract: Liquefaction is one of the main topics of seismic geotechnics. The effects
    of liquefaction on structures and installations during an earthquake can be very
    destructive. In the two earthquakes Alaska and Niigata Japan in 1964, spectacular
    examples of earthquake-induced failures, such as rupture of slopes, deformation
    of foundation in buildings and bridges, and the floating of buried structures
    a result of the flow of soil bed occurred. In liquefaction in general, soils tend
    to be denser when non-adherent, saturated and loose soils are exposed to earthquake
    vibrations. However, in certain granulation ranges, drainage is somewhat slow,
    as the rapid fluctuations in the soil due to lack of drainage will necessarily
    increase the pore pressure. Increasing pore water pressure results in a reduction
    in effective stress, which results in reduced shear resistance of the soil. Based
    on the relationship between the geostatic stresses in the soil, the increase in
    pore pressure may reduce the effective stress in the soil, which results in low
    or even zero shear strength and, consequently, Soil flows into fluid state, which
    is called liquefaction. In this research, we will study this phenomenon in the
    East of Urmia plain using the Japanese specifications for highway bridges 1999.
    The basis of this method is the evaluation of the liquefaction potential, by comparing
    the liquefaction resistance assessed from the soil SPT with the shear stress ratio
    induced by the earthquake to the normal effective stress from the earthquake.
    Of the 6 study boreholes, only one of the boreholes with high-liquefaction risk
    was evaluated. So the risk of liquefaction is very low. In general, the southern
    part of Urmia region requires more geotechnical studies due to the density of
    existing industries and roads, and also geophysical studies such as the use of
    shear waves.
