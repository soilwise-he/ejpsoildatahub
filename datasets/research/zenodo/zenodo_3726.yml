  title: Application Of Lattice Boltzmann Methods In Heat And Moisture Transfer In
    Frozen Soil
  abstract: Although water only takes a little percentage in the total mass of soil,
    it indeed plays an important role to the strength of structure. Moisture transfer
    can be carried out by many different mechanisms which may involve heat and mass
    transfer, thermodynamic phase change, and the interplay of various forces such
    as viscous, buoyancy, and capillary forces. The continuum models are not well
    suited for describing those phenomena in which the connectivity of the pore space
    or the fracture network, or that of a fluid phase, plays a major role. However,
    Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) are especially well suited to simulate flows
    around complex geometries. Lattice Boltzmann methods were initially invented for
    solving fluid flows. Recently, fluid with multicomponent and phase change is also
    included in the equations. By comparing the numerical result with experimental
    result, the Lattice Boltzmann methods with phase change will be optimized.
