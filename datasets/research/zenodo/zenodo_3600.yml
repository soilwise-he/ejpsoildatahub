  title: Performance Of Axially Loaded Single Pile Embedded In Cohesive Soil With
    Cavities
  abstract: The stability of a single model pile located adjacent to a continuous
    cavity was studied. This paper is an attempt to understand the behaviour of axially
    loaded single pile embedded in clayey soil with the presences of cavities. The
    performance of piles located in such soils was studied analytically. A verification
    analysis was carried out on available studies to assess the ability of analytical
    model to correctly interpret the system behaviour. The study was adopted by finite
    element program (PLAXIS). The study included many cases; in each case, there is
    a critical value in which the presence of cavities has shown minimum effect on
    the pile performance. Figures including the load carrying capacity of pile with
    the affecting factors are presented. These figures provide beneficial information
    for pile design constructed close to underground cavities. It was concluded that
    the load carrying capacity of the pile is reduced by the presence of the cavity
    within the soil mass. This reduction varies according to the size and location
    of cavity.
