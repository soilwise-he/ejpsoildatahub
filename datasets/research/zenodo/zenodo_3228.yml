  title: Evaluation of SMED Industrial Method to Increase the Crop Yield of Asparagus
    Based on Control of pH of Soil and Water in the Agricultural Industry of Mexicali
    Valley
  abstract: "&lt;table align=\"left\"&gt;\n\t&lt;tbody&gt;\n\t\t&lt;tr&gt;\n\t\t\t\
    &lt;td&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;In this scientific study was made an evaluation to\
    \ analyze the process to make the setup change in the agricultural industries\
    \ and improve the times of this change to have a better flow process. This investigation\
    \ was made in an agricultural industry located in the Mexicali Valley, which is\
    \ part of the Mexicali city that is located in the northwest of the Mexican Republic\
    \ and is a border zone between Mexico and Unites States of America (USA) and is\
    \ a commercial region with the California State of the USA. In this scientific\
    \ study was evaluated the three principal types of variety of asparagus of agricultural\
    \ machines as cutter, count and of package of agricultural products as asparagus\
    \ in an agricultural industry located in the Mexicali Valley, which is necessary\
    \ change the type of structures of each activity (cutter, count and of package),\
    \ being the setup change, and make as soon as possible this action. Each structure\
    \ to each type of asparagus evaluated in this investigation, have size and a time\
    \ to installed, and to know if was installed the correct structure to each asparagus\
    \ is necessary control by a computer system to avoid any damage to asparagus products\
    \ and the agricultural machinery. The method used to evaluate the crop yielding\
    \ of asparagus and with this the productivity and quality indices, was the Single\
    \ Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) as an industrial engineering method in the agricultural\
    \ industry. Also, in this scientific study was made an analysis of the occurrence\
    \ of corrective, preventive and predictive maintenance and obtain data of the\
    \ size of asparagus, time of cut and package and the weight and quantity of asparagus\
    \ cropped, cut off and packaged. This data was obtained by electronic sensors,\
    \ which are coupled to a computer systems and stored the data obtained to be evaluated\
    \ with statistical methods with graphs and tables. This scientific study was made\
    \ in 2022. This investigation was made in the Mexicali Valley, which is located\
    \ in the northwest of the Mexican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/td&gt;\n\t\t\
