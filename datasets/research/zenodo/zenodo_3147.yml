  title: Effects of set-aside management on certain elements of soil biota and early
    stage organic matter decomposition in a High Nature Value Area, Hungary
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Agricultural intensification is one of the greatest threats\
    \ to soil biota and function. In contrast, set-aside still remains a management\
    \ practice in certain agri-environmental schemes. In Hungary, the establishment\
    \ of sown set-aside fields is a requirement of agri-environmental schemes in High\
    \ Nature Value Areas. We tested the effects of set-aside management on soil biota\
    \ (bacteria, microarthropods, woodlice and millipedes), soil properties and organic\
    \ matter decomposition after an initial establishment period of two years. Cereal\
    \ \u2013 set-aside field pairs, semi-natural grasslands and cereal fields were\
    \ sampled in the Heves Plain High Nature Value Area in Eastern Hungary, in May\
    \ 2014. Topsoil samples were taken from each site for physical, chemical, microbial\
    \ analyses and for extraction of soil microarthropods. Macrodecomposers were sampled\
    \ by pitfall traps for two weeks. The biological quality of soil was estimated\
    \ by the integrated QBS index (''Qualit\xE0 Biologica del Suolo'', meaning ''Biological\
    \ Quality of Soil'') based on diversity of soil microarthropods. To follow early\
    \ stage organic matter decomposition, we used tea bags filled with a site-independent,\
    \ universal plant material (Aspalathus linearis, average mass 1.26 \xB1 0.03 g).\
    \ Tea bags were retrieved after 1 month to estimate the rate of mass loss. We\
    \ found significant differences between habitat types regarding several soil physical\
    \ and chemical parameters (soil pH, K and Na content). The study showed positive\
    \ effects of set-aside management on soil biodiversity, especially for microarthropods\
    \ and isopods. However, we did not experience similar trends in relation to soil\
    \ bacteria and millipedes. There was higher intensity of organic matter decomposition\
    \ in soils of set-aside fields and semi-natural grasslands (remaining mass on\
    \ average: 74.17% and 76.6%, respectively) compared to cereal fields (average\
    \ remaining mass: 81.3%). Out of the biotic components, only the biological quality\
    \ of soil significantly influenced (even if marginally) plant tissue decomposition.\
    \ Our results highlight the importance of set-aside fields as shelter habitats\
    \ for soil biota, especially for arthropods. Set-aside fields that are out of\
    \ a crop rotation for 2 years could be a valuable option for maintaining soil\
    \ biodiversity, as these fields may simultaneously conserve elements of above-\
    \ and below-ground diversity.&lt;/p&gt;"
