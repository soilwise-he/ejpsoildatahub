  title: The Effect of Amendment of Fish Waste Fertilizer to Soil and its Impact on
    the Growth and Nutritional Status of Trigonella foenum-graecum
  abstract: The current study has been aimed to utilise<br> the fish waste collected
    from the market as an organic<br> fertilizer to study its effect on the growth
    and nutritive<br> potential of Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek). The<br>
    experiment on fenugreek was conducted with and<br> without the application of
    fish waste fertilizer to the soil.<br> Fish waste fertilizer was prepared by mixing
    jaggery,<br> water and banana together and fermented up to 15 days<br> and used
    as an organic fertilizer which offer nutrients to<br> the soil that helps for
    the plant growth. Fish waste<br> fertilizer sprayed on the experimental plant
    for upto 10<br> days. This was maintained for both experimental plants<br> (Test)
    and normal plant without fertilizer (Control). The<br> germination of the plant,
    shoot length, root length, leaf<br> length and the time taken for growth were
    noted. After<br> the growth of the plant, the macro and micronutrients<br> were
    determined in both test and control plant. This<br> study showed a significant
    role of fish waste fertilizer in<br> enhancing the growth and nutritional quality
    when<br> compare to the normally grown plant without the fish<br> waste fertilizer.
    The number of seeds germinated, height<br> of the plant, and level of the minerals
    increased in the<br> test plant. This study showed that the fish waste acts as<br>
    an excellent organic fertilizer which continuously<br> provide nutrient to the
    soil and it results in better<br> growth and nutritional quality of the fenugreek
    and also creates way of converting waste to wealth which is eco-<br> friendly
    and cost= effective.
