  title: Effects of lime and swage sludge on soil, pasture production, and tree growth
    in a six-year-old Populus canadensis Moench silvopastoral system
  abstract: "In many regions worldwide, silvopastoral systems are implemented to enable\
    \ sustainable land\nuse allowing short, medium, and long-term economic returns.\
    \ However, the short-term production in silvopastoral systems is often limited\
    \ due to nonappropriate soil-fertility management. This study evaluated the effects\
    \ of two doses of lime (0 and 2.5 t CaCO3 ha\u20131) and three sewage-sludge treatments\
    \ (0, 200, and 400 kg total N ha\u20131 y\u20131 applied in 2 consecutive years)\
    \ on soil characteristics (soil pH, soil organic matter [SOM], soil nitrogen,\
    \ cation-exchange capacity [CEC]), pasture production, and tree growth in a silvopastoral\
    \ system of Populus \xD7 canadensis Moench in Galicia, northern Spain during 6\
    \ years after establishment. Soil pH increased during the experimental period\
    \ for all treatments, although this effect was more pronounced after lime application.\
    \ Changes in SOM and soil nitrogen content were not consistent over time, but\
    \ sewage-sludge application seemed to result in higher values. Higher CEC was\
    \ found for treatments with lime and sewage-sludge application. Following incorporation\
    \ of lime and sewage sludge, pasture production was significantly enhanced (cumulative\
    \ pasture production 51.9 t DM ha\u20131 for Lime/N400 compared to 39.0 t DM ha\u2013\
    1 for No lime/N0). This higher pasture production also affected tree growth due\
    \ to more severe competition between pasture and tree resulting in slower tree\
    \ growth. Liming and application of sewage sludge are relevant measures to improve\
    \ soil fertility and thereby optimizing the overall production of silvopastoral\
    \ systems. However, it is important not to overintensify pasture production to\
    \ ensure adequate tree growth."
