  title: Influence Of Pile Radius On Inertial Response Of Pile Group In Fundamental
    Frequency Of Homogeneous Soil Medium
  abstract: An efficient method is developed for the response of a group of vertical,
    cylindrical fixed-head, finite length piles embedded in a homogeneous elastic
    stratum, subjected to harmonic force atop the pile group cap. Pile to pile interaction
    is represented through simplified beam-on-dynamic-Winkler-foundation (BDWF) with
    realistic frequency-dependent springs and dashpots. Pile group effect is considered
    through interaction factors. New closed-form expressions for interaction factors
    and curvature ratios atop the pile are extended by considering different boundary
    conditions at the tip of the piles (fixed, hinged). In order to investigate the
    fundamental characteristics of inertial bending strains in pile groups, inertial
    bending strains at the head of each pile are expressed in terms of slenderness
    ratio. The results of parametric study give valuable insight in understanding
    the behavior of fixed head pile groups in fundamental natural frequency of soil
    stratum.
