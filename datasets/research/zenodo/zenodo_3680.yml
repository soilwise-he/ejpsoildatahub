  title: Measuring The Amount Of Eroded Soil And Surface Runoff Water In The Field
  abstract: Water erosion is the most important problems of the soil in the Jabel
    Nefusa area located in northwest of Libya; therefore, erosion station had been
    established in the Faculty of Veterinary and dryfarming research Station, University
    of the Al-japel Al-gharbi in Zentan. The length of the station is 72.6 feet, 6
    feet width and the percentage of its slope is 3%. The station were established
    to measure the amount of soil eroded and amount of surface water produced during
    the seasons 95/96 and 96/97 from each rain storms. The monitoring shows that there
    was a difference between the two seasons in the number of rainstorms which made
    differences in the amount of surface runoff water and the amount of soil eroded
    between the two seasons. Although the slope is low (3%), the soil texture is sandy
    and the land ploughed twice during each season surface runoff and soil eroded
    were occurred. The average amount of eroded soil was 3792 grams (gr) per season
    and the average amount of surface runoff water was 410 liter (L) per season. The
    amount of surface runoff water would be much greater from Jebel Nefusa upland
    with steep slopes and collecting of them will save a valuable amount of water
    which lost as a runoff while this area is in desperate of this water. The regression
    analysis of variance show strong correlation between rainfall depth and the other
    two depended variable (the amount of surface runoff water and the amount of eroded
    soil. It shows also strong correlation between amount of surface runoff water
    and amount of eroded soil.
