  title: survival, growth and some physiological characteristics of Thuja orientalis
    seedlings under different soil moisture content and Nitrogen fertilizer treatments
  abstract: In this study, in order to investigate the effect of drought and N fertilizer
    on <em>Thuja orientalis</em> seedlings quality, 270 pots filled with 2 kg of Soorkesh
    forest reserve area soil, and a newly established <em>Thuja orientalis</em> seedling
    were transplanted in each of the pots.  After 2 month, using RCBD based factorial
    experiment, 6 levels of drought (contains 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 15% and 10% F.C.)
    and 3 levels of N fertilizer (control, Low N, and High N) conducted till the end
    of the first growing season in 3 replications, under greenhouse conditions.Hereafter,
    we analyzed survival and some of  morphological and physiological properties,
    water use efficiency and quality index of seedlings after 5 month.
