  title: 'Autocorrelation Metrics to Estimate Soil Moisture Persistence From Satellite
    Time Series: Application to Semiarid Regions'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) products have become an
    important information source for the study of land surface processes in hydrology
    and land monitoring. Characterizing and estimating soil memory and persistence
    from satellite observations is of paramount relevance, and has deep implications
    in ecology, water management, and climate modeling. In this work, we address the
    problem of SM persistence estimation from microwave sensors using several autocorrelation
    metrics that, unlike traditional approaches, build on accurate estimates of the
    autocorrelation function from nonuniformly sampled time series. We show how the
    choice of the autocorrelation estimator can have a dramatic impact on the SM persistence
    metrics derived thereof, particularly given the nonuniform nature of satellite
    observations, yet this fact has been overlooked to a large extent in literature.
    We give empirical evidence of performance using ground-based SM measurements,
    as well as L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and C-band [Advanced
    Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT)] remotely
    sensed SM data. Experiments along transects allow us to scrutinize the inter-method
    consistency and the spatial-temporal characteristics of autocorrelation estimators.
    This motivates the introduction of novel measures of spatial-temporal autocorrelation
    and allows us to retrieve improved persistence estimates. Results over the Iberian
    Peninsula indicate the SM persistence patterns captured by L- and C-band microwave
    sensors over semiarid regions exhibit spatially concurrent patterns of persistence
    and support their combination in long-term data records. We conclude that accounting
    for the nonuniform nature of the satellite time series using robust autocorrelation
    estimations allows providing improved measures and spatial descriptions of SM
    persistence.&lt;/p&gt;'
