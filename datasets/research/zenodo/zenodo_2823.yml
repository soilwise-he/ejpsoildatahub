  title: 'The Effect of Light and Soil Moisture on the Environmental Behavior of Newts
    (Triturus vittatus vittatus, Urodela): A Detailed Study'
  abstract: 'The effects of light and moisture on the response of metamorphosed newts
    (<em>Triturus vittatus vittatus</em>) to hiding places were studied under experimental
    conditions. No significant differences (X<sup>2</sup>-test; <em>P</em> &gt; 0.05)
    were found in the choice of hiding places covered with black or transparent paper
    as the controls for the experiments. The newts'' selection of hiding place was
    significantly affected by soil moisture and negative phototaxis. Significant differences
    (X<sup>2</sup>-test; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) were found in the choice of hiding
    places between those covered by black paper and those covered by transparent,
    differently colored paper (transmitting different wavelengths of light): colorless,
    yellow, red, blue and green. The negative phototaxis differed with wavelength.
    The response to moisture was stronger than that to light. In all combinations
    tested, juvenile <em>T.</em> <em>v. vittatus </em>chose moist soil in hiding places
    covered by black or transparent paper, and the differences were significant (X<sup>2</sup>-test;
    <em>P</em> &lt; 0.001).'
