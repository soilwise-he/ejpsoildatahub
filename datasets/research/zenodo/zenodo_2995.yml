  title: THE EFFECT OF POTASSIUM SULFATE FERTILIZER ON POTASSIUM AND SULFUR CONTENT
    IN SOIL AND CORN YIELD (Zea mays L.) IN INCEPTISOL JATINANGOR
  abstract: Sulfur and potassium are two crucial elements that plants need. Sulfur
    is crucial for boosting the quality and quantity of agricultural harvests, whereas
    potassium is important for the process of plant growth. The research aimed to
    determine the effect of applying K2SO4 fertilizer on the K and S content in the
    soil and corn crop yields on Inceptisol.A Randomized Completely Design was used
    in the experiment at the Laboratory of Soil Chemistry and Plant Nutrition. Seven
    different potassium sulfate dose combinations were used, along with one dose of
    standard NPK, and one dose of control treatment for comparison. Each treatment
    was carried out three times.The parameters in this experiment were the content
    of potassium and sulfur also the yield of corn components. The results showed
    that, in comparison to the control and other treatments, applying one and a quarter-dose
    of potassium sulfate fertilizer had the greatest outcomes for the soil's potassium
    and sulfur content as well as corn yield. The maximum weight of corn cobs per
    hectare in comparison to the control and other treatments was 8,959 kg ha-1.
