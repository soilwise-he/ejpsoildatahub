  title: Response of Soil Properties, Growth, Yield and Fruit Quality of Cantaloupe
    Plants (Cucumis melo L.) to Organic Mulch
  abstract: A modified greenhouse study was performed in summer season 2016 and 2017
    to evaluate the effect of organic mulch on soil temperature, soil properties,
    vegetative growth, and total yield and its components for cantaloupe plants (<em>Cucumis
    melo </em>L.), 10411 F1 hybrids, at El-Bosialy site. Five types of organic mulches
    were used (chopped wheat straw, wood dust, chopped maize straw, rice straw, and
    chopped sugarcane straw) compared with bare soil as the control. Seedlings were
    transplanted in 1<sup>st</sup> of April 2016 and 2017. The experimental design
    was a randomized complete block with four replications. Results indicated as generally,
    the application of organic mulch treatments were the most effective in reducing
    maximum and minimum of soil temperature, improved soil properties (soil pH, soil
    organic matter, soil moisture content, soil bulk density, electrical conductivity
    and N. P. K. availability), enhanced vegetative development (plant height, total
    leaves area and fresh and dry weights of plant), improved percent of nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium in leaves, gave greatest values of
    fruit characters such as (fruit average weight and firmness), increased chemical
    components of fruits, i.e., (T.S.S and ascorbic acid) and maximum productivity
    for both early and total yields, also, economic evaluation presented that productivity
    was increased by application organic mulches compared to bare soil. Finally, wheat
    straw treatment had the greatest effect of all parameters.
