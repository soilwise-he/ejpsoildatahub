  title: Calculation of large-span glulam structures as a soil base-foundation-above-ground
    structure system
  abstract: 'The object of research. Long-span glulam arches are widely used as coatings
    for public and sports buildings. The studies carried out concern double-hinged
    segmental arches with spans of 60 m and more.



    Description of the problem. The study of the peculiarities of the work of arches
    as a system "soil base - foundation - above-ground structure" is associated with
    the significant influence of uneven deformations of supports on the stress-strain
    state of the above-ground structure. A change in the stress-strain state in the
    structure itself, associated with uneven deformations of the foundations, can
    lead to a significant decrease up to the complete exhaustion of the bearing capacity



    Main scientific results. This article provides an analysis of the change in the
    stress-strain state of glulam arches when calculating the system "soil base-foundation-above-ground
    structure". It is noted that non-uniform deformations of supports have the greatest
    influence on the stress in the support zones of the structure. The range of critical
    non-uniform subsidence has been determined, which should be limited when calculating
    and designing the foundations of large-span arches. It has been confirmed that
    double-hinged glulam arches work well in conditions of uneven subsidence due to
    the peculiarities of the design scheme.



    The results of the studies carried out and the recommendations provided will significantly
    improve the reliability of large-span structures and require mandatory inclusion
    in the current practice of calculation and design. In addition, additional requirements
    for the distance between mine workings for large-span structures should be introduced
    when performing engineering and geological surveys. This distance should be reduced
    for a clearer account of the deformability of the foundations for columnar foundations,
    and the number of workings should be increased.



    The area of practical use of the research results. The cross-section of the glulam
    arches is selected taking into account additional deformations of the supports,
    making it possible to avoid unpredictable damage to the structure during operation.



    Innovative technological product. Glulam arches, the cross-section of which is
    determined taking into account additional deformations from uneven subsidence
    of the supports



    Scope of application. Glulam arches calculated in this way can be used as covering
    for public and sports buildings for various purposes.'
