  title: Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity Used To Determine Soil Phosphorus Variability
    In Poultry Litter-Amended Pastures
  abstract: The objectives of this research were to determine the relationship between
    soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil P distribution, and to compare
    the effectiveness of noncontact mobile electromagnetic induction (EM) and direct
    contact methods for relating ECa to soil P. Studies were conducted at two locations
    in Southwest Missouri on a longterm forage fertility plot site and three 1 to
    1.5 ha sites within beef cattle pasture fields, all having received long-term
    poultry litter applications. For the long-term plot site, both the direct contact
    ECa sensor deep reading and the EM-38 (Geonics) sensor in the shallow mode had
    significant positive correlations with soil test Bray-1 P at both the 0 to 5 and
    5 to 15 cm sampling depths. Significant spatial variation in soluble, soil test
    Bray-1 and total P were observed by landscape position within pasture fields.
    In general, soil ECa was not significantly correlated with soluble, soil test
    Bray-1 and total P at each individual pasture site, but when data was combined
    over all three sites, significant relationships were observed between ECa measured
    by the EM-38 sensor and soil soluble P, soil test Bray-1 P and total P, especially
    when the vertical (deep) mode was used. The difference in performance of the two
    sensors between the two studies was attributed to the proportion of coarse fragments
    contained in the soils and soil water content. These results suggest that soil
    ECa measurements may provide some useful information for evaluating spatial variation
    in soil P due to manure applications. However, further research is needed to assess
    the processes and factors affecting this relationship before it can be recommended
    for use for improved soil P management in individual farm fields with varying
    environmental conditions and management practices.
