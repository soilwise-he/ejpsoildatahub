  title: Influence of carbon-based cathodes on biofilm composition and electrochemical
    performance in soil microbial fuel cells
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Increasing energy demands and environmental pollution concerns
    press for sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies. Soil microbial
    fuel cell (SMFC) technology has great potential for carbonneutral bioenergy generation
    and self-powered electrochemical bioremediation. In this study, an indepth assessment
    on the effect of several carbon-based cathode materials on the electrochemical
    performance of SMFCs is provided for the first time. An innovative carbon nanofibers
    electrode doped with Fe (CNFFe) is used as cathode material in membrane-less SMFCs,
    and the performance of the resulting device is compared with SMFCs implementing
    either Pt-doped carbon cloth (PtC), carbon cloth, or graphite felt (GF) as the
    cathode. Electrochemical analyses are integrated with microbial analyses to assess
    the impact on both electrogenesis and microbial composition of the anodic and
    cathodic biofilm. The results show that CNFFe and PtC generate very stable performances,
    with a peak power density (with respect to the cathode geometric area) of 25.5
    and 30.4 mW m2, respectively. The best electrochemical performance was obtained
    with GF, with a peak power density of 87.3 mW m2. Taxonomic profiling of the microbial
    communities revealed differences between anodic and cathodic communities. The
    anodes were predominantly enriched with Geobacter and Pseudomonas species, while
    cathodic communities were dominated by hydrogen-producing and hydrogenotrophic
    bacteria, indicating H2 cycling as a possible electron transfer mechanism. The
    presence of nitrate-reducing bacteria, combined with the results of cyclic voltammograms,
    suggests microbial nitrate reduction occurred on GF cathodes. The results of this
    study can contribute to the development of effective SMFC design strategies for
    field implementation.&lt;/p&gt;'
