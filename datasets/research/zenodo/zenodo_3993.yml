  title: An Overview Of The Factors Affecting Microbial-Induced Calcite Precipitation
    And Its Potential Application In Soil Improvement
  abstract: 'Microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a

    relatively green and sustainable soil improvement technique. It

    utilizes biochemical process that exists naturally in soil to improve

    engineering properties of soils. The calcite precipitation process is

    uplifted by the mean of injecting higher concentration of urease

    positive bacteria and reagents into the soil. The main objective of this

    paper is to provide an overview of the factors affecting the MICP in

    soil. Several factors were identified including nutrients, bacteria type,

    geometric compatibility of bacteria, bacteria cell concentration,

    fixation and distribution of bacteria in soil, temperature, reagents

    concentration, pH, and injection method. These factors were found to

    be essential for promoting successful MICP soil treatment.

    Furthermore, a preliminary laboratory test was carried out to

    investigate the potential application of the technique in improving the

    shear strength and impermeability of a residual soil specimen. The

    results showed that both shear strength and impermeability of

    residual soil improved significantly upon MICP treatment. The

    improvement increased with increasing soil density.'
