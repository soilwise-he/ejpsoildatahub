  title: Measurement of Radium Content and Radon Exhalation Rates from Some Soil Samples
    of Sri Ksetra Ancient City (Pyay Township)
  abstract: "The earth is radioactive since its creation. The radioactive elements\
    \ such as uranium, radium and<br> radon are present in soil, air and water. The\
    \ inhalation and ingestion of these radionuclides,<br> above the permissible level,\
    \ becomes a health hazard. In the present work, soil samples were<br> collected\
    \ from five different areas at Sri Ksetra Ancient City of Pyay Township and assessed\
    \ for<br> radon and radium content using LR-115 Solid State Nuclear Track Detector.\
    \ The \u2018CAN\u2019<br> technique has employed for measuring the radon concentration,\
    \ radium content, exhalation rates<br> in terms of area and mass were calculated\
    \ for these samples."
