  title: Rice Hull Ash Applied to Soil Reduces Leaf Blast Incidence
  abstract: This article 'Rice Hull Ash Applied to Soil Reduces Leaf Blast Incidence'
    appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series, created by the International
    Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication among scientists concerned
    with the development of improved technology for rice and rice-based systems. The
    series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each other informed of current rice
    research findings. The concise scientific notes are meant to encourage rice scientists
    to communicate with one another to obtain details on the research reported.
