  title: Genotypic expression of nutrient use efficiency and grain yield of lowland-rice
    varieties in heavy metal polluted inland valley soil in a derived savanna.
  abstract: Heavy metal pollution is a major environmental problem that can have significant
    impacts on crop productivity including nutrient use efficiency of crop plants
    and food security. Reports exist on the nutrient use efficiency of rice cultivars
    under some heavy metals' pollution either on mining-impacted soils or heavy metal
    infested soil. However, information on the varying abilities of different cultivars
    cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa to tolerate heavy metal pollution and maintain
    nutrient uptake and use efficiency under naturally polluted soil is inadequate.
    This is important to evolve site-specific management strategies that would be
    based on careful assessment of specific conditions and needs. A one-way factorial
    arrangement fitted into completely randomized design with twelve varieties in
    three replicates was conducted to investigate the variation in lowland rice cultivars
    uptake and use efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in an inland valley
    soil with toxicity of chromium, cobalt, iron, nickel and zinc. Grain yield, nutrient
    uptake and use efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were determined
    following standard procedures. Comparing the rice cultivars on the nutrients uptake,
    ART 350 consistently had the highest uptake of N, P and K (0.84, 0.75 and 3.10
    g plant-1 respectively), which resulted in highest grain yield of 54.9 g plant-1.
    However, WITA 4 cultivar had the highest use efficiency of N, P and K (232.2,
    384.5 and 61.0 g g-1 respectively). The studies suggest that varietal selection
    can help to improve nutrient uptake and use efficiency in lowland rice production
    when cultivation is constrained to heavy metals polluted soil.
