  title: Effect of Bio-Organomineral Fertilizer on Soil Chemical Properties and PB
    Content of Industrial Waste Polluted Soil
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rancaekek Sub-district is one of
    the agricultural centers in Bandung Regency, Indonesia, which is currently experiencing
    land conversion into an industrial area. The industrial activities produce waste
    containing heavy metal lead (Pb), which if not treated can pollute the soil and
    surrounding waters. Efforts to overcome soil pollution are through fertilization.
    The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the dose and incubation
    time of Bio-organomineral fertilizer with &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;
    biological agent on improving soil chemical properties and reducing soil Pb levels.
    This study used a two-factor Factorial Randomized Block Design, namely the dose
    and incubation time of Bio-organomineral fertilizer. The results showed that the
    combination of Bio-organomineral fertilizer dose of 225 kg.ha-1 and an incubation
    time of 30 days was able to increase soil K-potential. The independent factor
    of Bio-organomineral fertilizer dose had a significant effect on increasing soil
    pH. The independent factor of incubation time had a significant effect on reducing
    soil Pb levels. In particular, there was an interaction between the dose and incubation
    time of Bio-organomineral fertilizer on soil K-potential.&lt;/p&gt;'
