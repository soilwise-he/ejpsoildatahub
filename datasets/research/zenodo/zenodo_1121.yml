  title: A Review on Application of Rice Husk Ash for Soil Stabilization
  abstract: Black soils are good for agriculture but they are not suitable for foundation
    of building or subgrade for road pavement. On such soil suitable construction
    practices and sophisticated methods need to be adopted. In this experimental work
    the soil was stabilized with Rice Husk Ash in proportion of 10%, 20% and 30%.
    Following test are conducted on Soil sample, soil Consistency limits, Specific
    gravity, Unconfined Compression test, etc. When addition of Rice Husk ash, it
    shows that the Index and Mechanical Properties of soil has improved.
