  title: "Soil Acidification And Nutrient Sustainability Of Forest Ecosystems In The\
    \ Northeastern German Lowlands \u2013 Results Of The National Forest Soil Inventory"
  abstract: 'Between the first and second national forest soil inventory in the northeastern
    German lowlands a significant soil acidification took place with regionally varying
    intensity. It manifests itself in a reduced base saturation in the whole rooting
    zone. This applies to the base cations magnesium and calcium. For potassium, however,
    no significant changes were detected. The acidification dynamic is the strongest
    in the southern part of Brandenburg. The specific immission situation<br>

    in this region during the past four decades explains this. Particularly in southern
    Brandenburg high dust depositions (fly ashes from brown coal-fired power stations)
    buffered the acid components and enriched the soil with base cations<br>

    in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the reduction of these atmospheric depositions,
    the bases were obviously totally incorporated in the biomass or leached out with
    seepage water. Currently, the majority of the forest sites in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
    and Brandenburg are poor in basic nutrient elements (Ca, Mg, K). Especially the
    element magnesium is assumed to be lacking. This paper presents an assessment
    of the long-term availability of the nutrients Ca, Mg und K on the basis of calculated
    nutrient balances for various forest management scenarios (e.g. full-tree harvest).
    The results show that the sustainable supply is critical especially for intensive
    forest use on numerous sites.'
