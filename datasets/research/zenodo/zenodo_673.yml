  title: Technical report on aligned definitions and indicators characterizing agricultural
    soil threats and ecosystem services in various scales - EJP Soil SERENA Deliverable
    1.2
  abstract: "The purpose of SERENA\xB4s task 1.2 is to align research-based definitions\
    \ of soil policy concepts, soil threats, ecosystem services and relevant indicators\
    \ amongst end-users representing administration, decision makers and farmers from\
    \ various European countries and pedo-climatic conditions. To communicate definitions\
    \ and indicators to stakeholders and gather their opinions, an online questionnaire\
    \ was developed and widely spread around European soil experts. The agreement\
    \ of participants with proposed definitions and indicator allocations was demanded\
    \ and the possibility for text comments was provided. The results showed a high\
    \ level of agreement with the proposed definitions, only a few were rated distinctively\
    \ lower than the average and therefore chosen for reformulation. As an interesting\
    \ pattern, it was observed that rather new terms such as Ecosystem Services or\
    \ Bundles were rated worse than more established ones. The text comments revealed\
    \ rather clear and consistent critics and proposals for improvement, which were\
    \ implemented in a set of new terminology."
