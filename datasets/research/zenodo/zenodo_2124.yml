  title: STUDY OF THE EFFICIENCY OF APPLICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOSTS IN COTTON UNDER
    TYPICAL GRAY SOIL CONDITIONS
  abstract: In the agriculture of our country, the demand for organic fertilizers
    is high, and in some cases there is a shortage of them. In fact, tons of organic
    fertilizer should be applied. However, it is not possible to collect this amount
    of organic fertilizers. It is necessary to find additional sources of organic
    mass and nutrients that can be given to the soil, fresh water mud, leaves of trees
    that have fallen in the fall, bacterial preparations, some of them contain large
    amounts of organic matter, macro- and microelements, and plants There are other
    substances necessary for growth. With organic fertilizers, along with all the
    nutrients necessary for the plant, a large amount of microorganisms also fall
    into the soil. These microorganisms enrich the microflora of the soil and activate
    the microbiological processes (rotting, ammonification) taking place in it.
