  title: Correction coefficients of distortion and vibration period for buildings
    due to soil-structure interaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The present research analyzed the influence of the soil structure
    interaction (SSI) in buildings, varying geotechnical parameters and height, considering
    3 international codes. The responses obtained from the structures taking into
    account the SSI, were compared with the responses of fixed-base buildings, being
    the main control variables: the period and the drift. It was determined that the
    estimated range in which the period of the structure increases is from 30 to 98%,
    demonstrating the influence of considering soil flexibility. Due to the variability
    of the responses obtained, an adjustment factor is proposed to predict said amplification
    of the control variables, depending on the height of the building and the ground.&lt;/p&gt;'
