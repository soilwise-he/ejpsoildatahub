  title: Seeder developed for direct sowing of rice under the puddled soil surface
  abstract: This article 'Seeder Developed for Direct Sowing of Rice Under the Puddled
    Soil Surface' appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series, created
    by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each
    other informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific notes
    are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to obtain
    details on the research reported.
