  title: Evaluation Of Liquefaction Potential Of Baghdad Soil During Earthquakes
  abstract: This paper is concerned with the evaluation of Baghdad soil liquefaction
    potential under earthquakes effect. Data of soil investigation reports such as
    borehole total depth, water table level, total unit weight, standard penetration
    number and fines percentage were used. Data for  630 boreholes represent 200 site
    location points for many different types of projects spread all  over the city
    have been chosen and analyzed using LiquefyPro software. Two user factors of safety
    and two options for fines correction have been used. Six earthquake magnitudes
    (M=4 to 6.5 with 0.5 interval) have been chosen to analyze the data. Only 121
    points show susceptibility to liquefaction. The final output is shown in tables
    and the points are shown on GIS maps. The results state that the effects of earthquake
    induced liquefaction should be taken in consideration in future design.
