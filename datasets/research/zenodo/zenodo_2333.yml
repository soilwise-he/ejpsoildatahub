  title: Assessment of Soil Fertility Status of Mango Orchard at Vikarabad Farmhouse
    in Manneguda Village of Telangana State
  abstract: The present study was conducted at Farmhouse, located in Manneguda at
    Gangupally village to find out the soil<br> fertility status. The soil samples
    were analyzed based on physical, physiochemical, and chemical properties The<br>
    soils of Mango orchards in Manneguda village at Vikarabad district in Telangana
    state at 0-30 cm depth were<br> studied by using standard analytical methods to
    find out the fertility status of these orchard soils. The results show<br> that
    the sand content was higher than the clay content. The majority of the soil textural
    class was sandy clay loam<br> (50.08%) followed by clay loam (38.0%). and Clay
    (11.92%). Organic carbon was found to be as low to medium,<br> soil pH was neutral
    to moderately alkaline in reaction, EC of the soils was normal in condition, available
    nitrogen<br> was low, and available phosphorus was low to medium in range. All
    the locations showed an average recorded<br> medium to highly available potassium.
    The majority of soil locations recorded sufficient calcium, magnesium, and<br>
    sulfur contents. Among micronutrients, zinc, and boron were deficient in these
    soils. Although the soil fertility status<br> is low to medium, it can be enhanced
    through the application of soil test-based fertilizers, recommendations, and<br>
    proper management practices, to achieve the targeted yields of Mango and other
    crops (Riazuddin Ahmed,<br> et.al.,2007).<br> Mango is the national fruit and
    deserves nationwide attention to achieve the top position in the world, retain
    the title<br> of national fruit, and help the farmers to get profit from the mango
    orchards. Available evidence suggests that the<br> yield gap between average farm
    yields is achieved from a mission mode to adopt the available technologies of<br>
    orchard management, across the country to enhance the productivity, yield, and
    profitability of mango orchards and<br> achieve the goal of doubling the income
    of mango farmers by 2022 (Ganeshamurthy, et.al.,2018).
