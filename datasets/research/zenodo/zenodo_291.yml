  title: STUDY OF SOIL TEXTURE AND MOISTURE CONTENT EFFECT ON SOIL COMPACTION FOR
    LONG-YEAR TILLED FARM LAND
  abstract: Farm mechanization is the main indicator of modernizing the agriculture
    and use of farm machines that can take the place of human and animal power in
    agricultural processes. During field operation the weight of farm machinery compact
    the agricultural soil due to the contact with the tires or tracks of tractors.
    The aim of the article is to study the effects of soil texture and moisture content
    on soil compaction. During field experimental test 5 different depth (5, 10, 15,
    20 and 25 cm) were selected for taking soil compaction data and soil samples at
    three depth range (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) from Kulumsa Agricultural research
    center farm land at two seasons. During compaction test 15 sample point data were
    taken from 0.6 ha farm land. The result of the study shows from average of all
    sample point the maximum and minimum value of soil compaction value where 3.73
    Mpa and 3.032 Mpa during harvesting season and 1.37 Mpa and 1.19 Mpa during seeding
    season respectively. The laboratory result shows farm land soil is clay with 25.0%
    of sand, 51% of clay and 24 % silt during both experimental seasons. The maximum
    and minimum percentage of soil moisture value where 28.92% and 20.04% during harvesting
    season and 41.8% and 30.8% at 20 to 30 cm and 0 to 10 cm depth respectively.
