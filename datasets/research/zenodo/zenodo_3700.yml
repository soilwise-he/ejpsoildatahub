  title: Effect Of Different Methods Of Soil Fertility On Grain Yield And Chickpea
    Quality
  abstract: "In order to evaluation the effects of natural, biological\nand chemical\
    \ fertilizers on grain yield and chickpea quality, field\nexperiments were carried\
    \ out in 2007 and 2008 growing seasons. In\nthis research the effects of different\
    \ organic, chemical and biological\nfertilizers were investigated on grain yield\
    \ and quality of chickpea.\nExperimental units were arranged in split-split plots\
    \ based on\nrandomized complete blocks with three replications. The highest\n\
    amounts of yield and yield components were obtained in G1\xD7N5\ninteraction.\
    \ Significant increasing of N, P, K, Fe and Mg content in\nleaves and grains emphasized\
    \ on superiority of mentioned treatment\nbecause each one of these nutrients has\
    \ an approved role in\nchlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis ability of the\
    \ crop. The\ncombined application of compost, farmyard manure and chemical\nphosphorus\
    \ (N5) had the best grain quality due to high protein, starch\nand total sugar\
    \ contents, low crude fiber and reduced cooking time."
