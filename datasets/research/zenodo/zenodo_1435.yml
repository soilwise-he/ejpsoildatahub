  title: Evaluation of a Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems Spectral Sensor for Soil
    Properties Estimation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil properties estimation with the use of reflectance spectroscopy
    has met major advances&nbsp;over the last decades. Their non-destructive nature
    and their high accuracy capacity enabled a&nbsp;breakthrough in the efficiency
    of performing soil analysis against conventional laboratory techniques.&nbsp;As
    the need for rapid, low cost, and accurate soil properties&rsquo; estimations
    increases, micro electro mechanical&nbsp;systems (MEMS) have been introduced and
    are becoming applicable for informed decision&nbsp;making in various domains.
    This work presents the assessment of a MEMS sensor (1750&ndash;2150 nm) in&nbsp;estimating
    clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. The sensor was first tested under
    various&nbsp;experimental setups (different working distances and light intensities)
    through its similarity assessment&nbsp;(Spectral Angle Mapper) to the measurements
    of a spectroradiometer of the full 350&ndash;2500 nm&nbsp;range that was used
    as reference. MEMS performance was evaluated over spectra measured from&nbsp;102
    samples in laboratory conditions. Models&rsquo;&nbsp; calibrations were performed
    using random forest (RF)&nbsp;and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The
    results provide insights that MEMS could be employed&nbsp;for soil properties
    estimation, since the RF model demonstrated solid performance over both&nbsp;clay
    (R2 = 0.85) and SOC (R2 = 0.80). These findings pave the way for supporting daily
    agriculture&nbsp;applications and land related policies through the exploration
    of a wider set of soil properties.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
