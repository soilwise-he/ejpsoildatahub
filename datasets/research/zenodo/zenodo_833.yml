  title: Effect Of Co2 Sequestration On Soil Liquefaction In Geological Pits
  abstract: '<strong>This paper deals with review of the previous related research
    on evaluation of soil liquefaction due to Carbon sequestration by various Carbon
    Capture Sequestration processes in geological pits. It provides critical literature
    recommendations on evaluation of soil liqu efaction potential assessment. The
    detection of soil liquefaction by using seismic records has been developed by
    various researchers. With this information,the evaluation of soil liquefaction
    are well under stood and this lead to a more precise and confident output. Gaining
    support for CCS will require engaging the interest and building the support of
    a variety of stakeholders,each with differ ent perspectives and goals. Although,CCS
    builds upon a technology base developed over more than half a century by the oil
    and gas industry. In the past,the industrially released CO 2 had been introduced
    to ocean which was harming the aquatic animals. In view of this,the sequestration
    of CO 2 into ocean was internationally banned. Hence,now much of the Carbon sequestration
    process is done by various industries in geolog ical pits. This creates a major
    threat to the earth quake problems worldwide. With the enhanced frequenc y of
    earthquakes all around the world,it is presumed by many environment scientists
    that the CO 2 sequestration pits leads to soil liquefaction and hence it results
    in more frequent earth quakes. T herefore,this paper summarises,different methods
    to evaluate liquefaction potential of soil by usi ng studies from seismic waves
    generated in earth,it is also propose it is also explains different me thodology
    for an eco friendly technology to reduce CO 2 from environment.</strong>
