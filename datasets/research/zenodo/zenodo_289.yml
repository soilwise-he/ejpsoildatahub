  title: 'Assessment of soil microbial functional diversity: land use and soil properties
    affect CLPP-MicroResp and enzymes responses'
  abstract: "The assessment of microbial functional diversity is an important indicator\
    \ of soil quality. Different methodological approaches are currently used; among\
    \ them are enzyme activities (EA) and CLPP (community level physiological profile)\
    \ techniques (e.g. MicroResp<strong>\u2122</strong>, MR). The aims of the study\
    \ were: <strong>i</strong>) to assess the efficacy of both methods in capturing\
    \ differences among various land use categories when different levels of selected\
    \ explanatory variables such as, total organic carbon (TOC) and pH are considered,\
    \ and <strong>ii</strong>) to explore, through a quantile regression approach,\
    \ the possible relationships between each of the two methods with land use category,\
    \ TOC and pH. The Shannon diversity index (H<strong>\u2019</strong>), calculated\
    \ from EA and MR data, was chosen as a synthetic index deriving from the same\
    \ mathematical model. The quantile regression model (QRM), the Kruskal-Wallis\
    \ and Spearman rank correlation tests were performed. Enzyme activities and MicroResp\
    \ were reliable ecological indicators to assess soil microbial functional diversity.\
    \ No correlation was found between the diversity indexes, H<strong>\u2019</strong>EA\
    \ and H<strong>\u2019</strong>MR; it was therefore supposed that the two methods\
    \ may target complementary components of microbial functional diversity. Both\
    \ methods were effective in capturing differences among various land use categories,\
    \ in particular H<strong>\u2019</strong>MR in soils with low TOC content (&lt;\
    \ 1.5%). Moreover, the QRM approach allowed a more detailed analysis along the\
    \ distribution of the diversity indexes (H<strong>\u2019</strong>EA and H<strong>\u2019\
    </strong>MR) indicating that H<strong>\u2019</strong>EA was more dependent on\
    \ the selected variables. Moscatelli M.C., Secondi, L., Marabottini, R., Papp,\
