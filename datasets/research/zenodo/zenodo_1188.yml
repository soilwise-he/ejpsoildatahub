  title: Characterisation of Rhizosphere Soil Bacteria from Rice Varieties Grown under
    Greenhouse Environment
  abstract: "The bacteria community in the rhizosphere region is critical for the\
    \ growth of plants and the formation of soil organic matter. This study focuses\
    \ on the identification of rhizospheric soil bacteria from rice varieties grown\
    \ under greenhouse environment. Samples of Oryza sativa and Oryza glabberima were\
    \ collected from the National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) Umuahia and Rice\
    \ mill at Kpirikpiri Ebonyi State. Oryza sativa grew more rapidly than Oryza glabberima\
    \ because of the variations in rice species. The rice seeds were planted in nursery\
    \ and transplanted in buckets under greenhouse conditions (75% humidity and at\
    \ room temperature 25\xB0C). The adhering soil samples from the rhizosphere region\
    \ were gotten from the roots and 1g of soil weighed aseptically and dissolve in\
    \ sterile distilled water. An aliquot was picked for serial dilution. The serially\
    \ diluted aliquot was inoculated on nutrient agar and incubated. Individual colonies\
    \ were subcultured. Microbiological, biochemical and sugar fermentation tests\
    \ were able to classify the isolates from Oryza sativa into Azotobacter spp.,\
    \ and Bacillus spp., and Oryza glabberima into Bacillus spp and Pseudomonas spp.\
    \ respectively. This study showed that there are a lot of soil bacteria in the\
    \ rhizospheric region of Oryza sativa than Oryza glabberima because it is an improved\
    \ variety and enhance the utilization of available nutrients and minerals by microbial\
    \ interaction which enable rapid growth of the plant, therefore, Oryza sativa\
    \ should be cultivated more for high yield and large-scale agricultural production.\n\
