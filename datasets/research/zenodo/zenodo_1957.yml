  title: Response of boreal clay soil properties and erosion to ten years of no-till
    management
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;We compared soil physical, chemical and biological properties,
    erosion rate and carbon allocation to soil physical&lt;br&gt;

    fractions between conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) management at a clay
    soil site under spring cereal&lt;br&gt;

    monoculture in southwestern Finland. Subsurface drain discharge, surface runoff
    and soil erosion were continuously&lt;br&gt;

    monitored in 2008 -&nbsp;2018. At the end of the 10-year monitoring period in
    2018, various soil properties&lt;br&gt;

    and earthworm total density, mass and species richness were determined. Total
    soil erosion was 56% less in NT&lt;br&gt;

    than in CT although surface water discharge was higher in NT. NT had a clear effect
    on the topsoil physical&lt;br&gt;

    structure by decreasing the pore size and increasing soil aggregate size. The
    total soil carbon stock in the 700 kg&lt;br&gt;

    m-2 mineral topsoil layer (approx. 0-60 cm layer) was slightly lower in NT (108
    &plusmn; 12 Mg C ha-1) than in CT&lt;br&gt;

    (118 &plusmn; 9.0 Mg C ha-1) due to lower carbon content of the 10-30 cm layer
    in NT. In NT the proportion of large&lt;br&gt;

    macroaggregates was higher and more organic carbon was bound to large macroaggregates
    in the 0-10 cm layer&lt;br&gt;

    which may be related to the higher abundance of earthworms in NT. The results
    showed that NT is an effective&lt;br&gt;

    method to reduce erosion rates but other means to increase carbon input especially
    below the topsoil layer are&lt;br&gt;

    likely required to achieve a significant increase in the carbon stock of boreal
    clay soils. For both tillage managements,&lt;br&gt;

    the rate of erosion through subsurface drains depended clearly on annual precipitation
    and winter&lt;br&gt;

    temperature, posing a challenge in the future climate with mild winters and more
    extreme discharges.&lt;/p&gt;'
