  title: VERTICAL DEFORMATION OF LIME REATED BASE (LTB) MODEL OF LATERITE SOIL USING
    NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
  abstract: This study aim to analyze and produce vertical deformation of lime treated
    base model of laterite soil. The samples of laterite soil were obtained from Sorowako
    Regency of East Luwu, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The physical and mechanical properties
    of the soil are obtained from laboratory testing, according to American Standard
    for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The lime treated base of the laterite soil layer
    is modeled with the dimension of length (L) = 4 m, width (W) = 2 m, and height
    (H) = 1.5 m. Stabilization of laterite soil with lime was conducted with variations
    of lime addition of 3, 5, 7, an 10%, under the maximum density conditions of standard
    Proctor test results. The model of the layers consists of soil subgrade layer
    (1.5 m), and lime treated base layer of laterite soil (0.1 m). Furthermore, the
    physical model is numerically analyzed by the finite element method. The results
    showed that the lime treated base layer with 10% lime content reduced the vertical
    deformation three times less than the laterite soil without stabilization. While
    the vertical deformation of the lime treated base layer meets the maximum deflection
    (L/240) in the addition of 710% lime.
