  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The effect of soil textural property on nutrient profile of
    Clarias gariepinus from earthen ponds was investigated between March and August
    2016. Three soil profile pits were dug side-by-side three existing earthen ponds
    in three different geomorphological locations of Imo State at Umuagwo, Ulakwo,
    and Uboma. Three homogenous soil horizons (0&ndash;20, 20&ndash;60, and 60&ndash;150
    cm) were identified and evaluated for soil moisture, soil textural class, and
    nutrient composition by standard methods (USDA, 1971). 10 adults of C. gariepinus
    of 580 &plusmn; 6.5 g average weight randomly selected from the associated earthen
    ponds were chemically evaluated for carcass composition in accordance with AOAC
    (2005). Soil textural class of fish pond was sandy at Umuagwo (sand: 79.8 &plusmn;
    6.4%, silt: 11.7 &plusmn; 0.8%, and clay: 10.0 &plusmn; 0.7%), sandy loam at Ulakwo
    (sand: 68.7 &plusmn; 7.0%, silt: 16.0 &plusmn; 1.5%, and clay: 15. 3 &plusmn;
    1.3%), and clay loam at Uboma (sand: 32.8 &plusmn; 3.0%, silt: 21.5 &plusmn; 2.8%,
    and clay: 50.0 &plusmn; 4.8%). Crude protein of fish carcass from the clay pond
    (27.6 &plusmn; 2.0%) and crude fat (18.2 &plusmn; 0.8%) was significantly higher
    (P &lt; 0.05) than in the sandy pond (14.2 &plusmn; 0.8% and 2.3 &plusmn; 1.2%)
    and the sandy loam (18.1 &plusmn; 1.0% and 11.1 &plusmn; 0.2%) ponds, respectively.
    Soil textural property was positively related to carcass quality of C. gariepinus
    in earthen ponds.&lt;/p&gt;'
