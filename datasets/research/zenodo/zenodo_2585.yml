  title: Quantifying vehicular heavy metal deposits on roadside soil and vegetation
    along Akure-Ilesa express road, South-Western Nigeria
  abstract: "Vehicular emission is one of the major sources of heavy metal deposition\
    \ on roadside vegetation and soil. This is influence by the degree of traffic\
    \ congestions on the road. The heavy metals can affect plants negatively with\
    \ health hazards to humans and animals in the food chain. This study investigated\
    \ the quantity of vehicular heavy metal deposits on vegetation and soil along\
    \ Akure-Ilesa road. Plant and soil samples were collected at 10 km intervals along\
    \ Akure-Ilesa road, digested using Aqua regia methods and metals; Cd, Pb, Cr,\
    \ Zn and Cu contents determined with Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS).\
    \ Data were analysed with ANOVA and t-test and differences tested at p\u22640.05.\
    \ The study revealed that; 0.021 \u2013 0.320, 0.110 \u2013 0.301, 0.092 \u2013\
    \ 0.170, 0.055 \u2013 0.113 and 0.061 \u2013 1.280 mg/kg; and 0.068 \u2013 0.421,\
    \ 0.110 \u2013 0.410, 0.100 \u2013 0.181, 0.008 \u2013 0.141, and 0.267 \u2013\
    \ 0.411 mg/kg of Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu, and Zn were found in plants and soils respectively.\
    \ It was concluded that vehicular emissions contributed to the heavy metal load\
    \ of the roadside vegetation and soil."
