  title: 'CBR of Ginger Cultivation with special reference to Soil type: A Comparative
    Study of Satara and Aurangabad District'
  abstract: "India is known as \u201CThe Home of Spices\u201D. Ginger is one of the\
    \ important spice crops having an area of 4,27,423 hectares with a production\
    \ of 16,18,627 tons in World. At international level India is a second largest\
    \ country with 27.24 percent of the total global production of ginger. Other important\
    \ producer countries are China, Indonesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Thailand,\
    \ Philippines, Cameron and U.S.A. The countries importing the highest amount of\
    \ ginger are the United States, Bangladesh and United Kingdom. Behalf of the ginger\
    \ having an area of 1,05,500 hectares with a production of 5,17,800 tones in India.\
    \ Major production of this important spice crop is confined to Assam, Kerala,\
    \ Gujarat, Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Orissa, and Maharashtra. Ginger\
    \ commonly called \u2018<em>Aale</em>\u2019 is grown in an area of 3,426 hectares\
    \ with a production of 34,267 metric tons in Maharashtra. More than 49 percent\
    \ of the area and production is mainly from Satara and Aurangabad district and\
    \ hence ginger cultivation is the backbone of the particular farmers. Area under\
    \ different exotic varieties like, Maran, Rio-De-Janiro, Udaypuri, Chhattisgarh,\
    \ Godhra, Bangalore, Himachal and Suprabha gradually increase in different pockets\
    \ of Maharashtra. In fact, varied agro-climatic conditions prevailing in India\
    \ are suitable to grow almost all spices. However, soil is another important factor\
    \ which effect on productivity and production of any crop. And hence here is an\
    \ attempt to try find out soil type-wise cost benefit ratio (CBR) of Satara and\
    \ Aurangabad district of Maharashtra State which is further guide for remaining\
    \ ginger growers."
