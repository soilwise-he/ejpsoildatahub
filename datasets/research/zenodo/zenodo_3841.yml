  title: The Effect Of Soil Contamination On Chemical Composition And Quality Of Aronia
    (Aronia Melanocarpa) Fruits
  abstract: A field study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and quality
    of the Aronia fruits, as well as the possibilities of Aronia cultivation on soils
    contaminated with heavy metals. The experiment was performed on an agricultural
    field contaminated by the Non-Ferrous-Metal Works (NFMW) near Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
    The study included four varieties of Aronia; Aron variety, Hugin variety, Viking
    variety and Nero variety. The Aronia was cultivated according to the conventional
    technology on areas at a different distance from the source of pollution NFMW-
    Plovdiv (1 km, 3.5 km, and 15 km). The concentrations of macroelements, microelements,
    and heavy metals in Aronia fruits were determined. The dry matter content, ash,
    sugars, proteins, and fats were also determined. Aronia is a crop that is tolerant
    to heavy metals and can successfully be grown on soils contaminated with heavy
    metals. The increased content of heavy metals in the soil leads to less absorption
    of the nutrients (Ca, Mg and P) in the fruit of the Aronia. Soil pollution with
    heavy metals does not affect the quality of the Aronia fruit varieties.
