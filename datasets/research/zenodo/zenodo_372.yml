  title: Activity of soil protease enzyme as influenced by dimethomorph and pyraclostrobin
    fungicides to groundnut Arachis hypogaea L. soil.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil microbial diversity is indispensable to maintain functional
    diversity and enzyme mediated critical soil processes that detoxify soil from
    environmental pollutants, like pesticides. Thus, the present study was carried
    out to assess the effect of different concentrations of the fungicides on the
    activity of protease, in clay and sandy loam groundnut soils of Anantapuramu District
    of Andhra Pradesh , India. The use of pesticides in agriculture has highly increased
    during the last 40 years to increase crop yields. However, today most pesticides
    are polluting water, soil, atmosphere and food. Pesticides are also impact soil
    enzymes, which are essential catalysts ruling the quality of soil life. A laboratory
    experiment was conducted to study the effect of selected fungicides, dimethomorph
    and pyraclostrobin, at concentrations ranging from 0 to10 kg ha 1 on the activity
    of protease. The activities of protease were significantly more at pyraclostrobin
    and dimethomorph levels of 5.0 and 2.5 kg ha 1, respectively. But at higher concentrations
    of 7.5 and 10 kg ha 1 respectively, dimethomorph and pyraclostrobin were toxic
    to protease activities. In soil samples receiving 2.5 5.0 kg ha 1 of the fungcides,
    the accumulation of reducing sugar was pronounced more at 20 days, and the activity
    of the protease was drastically decreased with increasing period of incubation
    up to 30 and 40 days.The results of the present study thus, clearly, indicate
    that application of the Fungicides in cultivation of groundnut, at field application
    rates improved the activity of protease in soils. P. Ramanamma | V. Rangaswamy
