    Mohanpur-741 252, Nadia, West Bengal, India <em>Manuscript received 09 January
    2018, revised 06 March 2018, accepted 21 March 2018</em> A field experiment was
    conducted to study the changes in different fractions of sulphur in soils grown
    with rapeseed (<em>cv. Binay</em>) crop. Sulphur was added in two levels along
    with recommended doses of NPK, farm yard manure (FYM) and sulphur oxidising bacteria
    (SOB) (<em>Thiobacillus ferroxidans</em>) as different treatment combinations
    to study the changes in different fractions of sulphur at various growth stages
    of rapeseed. Results show that the stover yield of rapeseed was increased with
    higher dose of FYM but lower dose of S, while the highest seed yield was obtained
    with higher dose of S and lower dose of FYM along with the SOB and recommended
    doses of N, P and K. Sulphate sulphur, adsorbed sulphur, organic sulphur and total
    sulphur were found to be decreased with increase in the period of crop growth
    maintaining a dynamic equilibrium. The decrease in different fractions of sulphur
    is due to its utilization by the growing crop. Different fractions of sulphur
    in soil showed an interrelationship within themselves'
