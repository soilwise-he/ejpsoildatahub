  title: Effect of Application Several Types of Ameliorants on Nutrient Uptake and
    Growth of Sweet Corn in Sandy Soil
  abstract: The most significant barriers to boosting soil<br> fertility and sweet
    corn plant growth are porous sandy<br> soil and relatively low water retention
    capacity. This<br> study aims to see how different types of ameliorants affect<br>
    the absorption of NP nutrients and the growth of sweet<br> corn (Zea mays L. var.
    saccharata) in sandy soil. From<br> May to July 2023, the research was conducted
    at Moncok<br> Karya, Pejeruk Karya Village, Ampenan District,<br> Mataram City,
    Indonesia. The trial was set up using a<br> randomized block design with five
    ameliorant treatments:<br> PO (control), PA (rice husk charcoal rice), PK (compost),<br>
    PS (cow manure), and PC (a mixture of rice husk<br> charcoal, compost, and cow
    manure). The results showed<br> that a 20 t ha-1 dose of ameliorant rice husk
    charcoal,<br> compost, and cow dung resulted in N and P nutrient<br> absorption,
    height, and number of leaves of maize plants<br> at 14, 28, and 42 days after
    planting (DAP), the highest<br> stover weight per plant, and mycorrhizal growth.
