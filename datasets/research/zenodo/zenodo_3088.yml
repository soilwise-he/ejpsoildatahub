  title: Improvement of the methodology for the assessment of soil biogenic pollution
    through the use of geoecological approaches and the use of information technologies
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study of the components of the balance of biogenic elements
    in anthropogenic ecosystems has been carried out and the mechanism for calculating
    the balance of biogenic elements has been determined. The necessity of improving
    the existing methodology is proved, which consists in preliminary modeling of
    the catchment area using geoinformation methods. On the example of the mouth of
    the river, a drainage area was modeled in Oril, during which the boundaries and
    total catchment area were determined, which is 39.7 thousand hectares. Experimental
    studies have determined the area of land according to their types of nature use
    (industrial, residential, forestry and agricultural, etc.). It has been established
    that only 15% of the investigated lands have agricultural use, however, it is
    this type of nature management that most contributes to biogenic pollution of
    this ecosystem. According to the results of calculations, it is determined that
    up to 10 thousand tons of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, are accumulated
    in the soil due to the excess use of mineral fertilizers. The results obtained
    indicate the feasibility and practical attractiveness of the proposed approach
    for calculating the balance of nutrients. Improvements include the application
    of digital elevation model and normalized vegetation index geodata obtained using
    ArcGIS Desktop software. It is shown that the technique used will allow obtaining
    the results of the adjusted volumes of nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in
    soils and indicating the sources of their input.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Thus, there are grounds for improving the methodology for calculating
    the balance of nutrients through the use of information technology. The geoecological
    approach will intensify the monitoring of nutrients, which will help to regulate
    the pressure on the ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;'
