  title: 'Influence of the Red Wood Ant Formica lugubris Zetterstedt (Hymenoptera:
    Formicidae) on the Surrounding Forest Soil Influence of the Red Wood Ant on the
    Forest Soil'
  abstract: "Red wood ants build their nests as above-ground mounds by collecting\
    \ organic<br> materials from the forest floor. The effects of ant nest to the\
    \ soil carbon and nitrogen along<br> with the soil pH, were measured. There was\
    \ an increase in pH with distance from the nests<br> while there was a decrease\
    \ in C and N concentration with the distance from the nest<br> increases. The\
    \ carbon content at the mound and nests center was differ, with carbon<br> percentage\
    \ more than double at the nests mound than in the center of the nest. In contrast\
    \ the<br> nitrogen percentage was higher at the nest center but with no significant\
    \ difference. The pH<br> was increased at the nests center while the soil was\
    \ more acidic at greater ratio. Red wood<br> ants\u2019 mounds do not significantly\
    \ alter the C and N concentrations in the forest ecosystem,<br> but they increase\
    \ spatial heterogeneity of the forest floor by storing organic matter and<br>\
    \ nutrients."
