  title: Impact of Wastewater on Nitrate Concentrations in Soil and Vegetables Grown
    along Kubanni River, Zaria in Kaduna State, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The concentration of nitrate was evaluated in wastewater, soil
    and vegetable (carrot, lettuce, onion, spinach, cabbage, tomato and okra) samples
    collected on seasonal basis from January, 2013 to September 2014 along Kubanni
    stream channels in Zaria. The results showed nitrate levels in wastewater were
    in the range of 23.05-283.54 mg/L for the year 2013 and 16.85-68.05 mg/L in the
    year 2014; soil had concentrations in the range of 2.20-20.50 mg/kg for 2013 and
    7.27-29.57 mg/kg for the second year while the vegetable had concentrations in
    the range of 3.80-23.65 mg/Kg for the year 2013 and 7.48-27.15 mg/Kg in year 2014.
    Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in nitrate concentrations
    across the locations and seasons for wastewater, soil and vegetables analyzed.
    Pearson correlation results revealed negative (r = -0.263) relationship between
    nitrate levels in wastewater for year 2013 and year 2014, likewise negative (r
    = -0.217) relationship was obtained for vegetables planted in the year 2013 and
    2014 whereas negligible (r = 0.137) relationship was recorded in the soil for
    these years. Nitrate concentrations obtained in this study was higher than maximum
    contaminant levels set by Standard Organization such as WHO and FAO for wastewater
    whereas the soil and vegetable of the sampling sites were not contaminated with
    nitrate ions.&lt;/p&gt;'
