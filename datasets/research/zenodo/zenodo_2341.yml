  title: 'Unheated soil-grown winter vegetables in Austria: Greenhouse gas emissions
    and socio-economic factors of diffusion potential'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The adaption of historic European cultivation techniques for
    unheated winter vegetable production has&lt;br&gt;

    gained momentum during the last years in Austria. Studies that evaluate ecological
    and socio-economic&lt;br&gt;

    sustainability-factors of these production techniques are scarce. In this study,
    we analyze the greenhouse&lt;br&gt;

    gas emissions along vegetable supply chains based on a life cycle approach and
    investigate factors of the&lt;br&gt;

    socio-economic system towards future market diffusion of these new-old technologies
    based on the&lt;br&gt;

    Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) guidelines of
    the Food and Agriculture&lt;br&gt;

    Organization (FAO). Data of the supply-chains of lettuce, spinach, scallions and
    red radish was collected&lt;br&gt;

    from field trials in different climatic regions in Austria and compared to existing
    commercial systems in&lt;br&gt;

    Austria and Italy. The results show, that unheated winter vegetable production
    is feasible. Greenhouse&lt;br&gt;

    gas emissions of unheated vegetables are lower with 0.06e0.12 kg CO2 equivalent
    versus 0.61e0.64 kg&lt;br&gt;

    CO2 equivalent per kg fresh product crops from heated systems. Due to small packaging
    units unheated&lt;br&gt;

    vegetables show maxima of 0.58 kg CO2 equivalent per kg product. Heated products
    were outreached by&lt;br&gt;

    two times when individual shopping trips to the farm were taken into account.
    Keeping salad frost-free&lt;br&gt;

    was not found to contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared
    to conventional&lt;br&gt;

    systems. The analysis reveals that a diffusion of unheated winter harvest systems
    depend primarily on 11&lt;br&gt;

    interdepending socio-economic factors. An innovative subsidy system and the creation
    of a positive&lt;br&gt;

    image of winter harvest from unheated vegetables production together with an increased
    utilization rate&lt;br&gt;

    of polytunnel areas and the consultancy for producers and processors are the most
    influential factors&lt;br&gt;

    towards a sustainable market diffusion of winter harvest produce.&lt;/p&gt;'
