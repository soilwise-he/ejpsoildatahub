  title: PRODUCTION OF ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUGS FROM SOIL MICROORGANISMS
  abstract: As number of cancer patients increasing, the number of chemotherapy treatments
    are also increasing. This analysis aims to provide a cutting-edge outline of the
    antineoplastic medications extracted from streptomyces. Streptomyces are the main
    source of antibiotic production. Antineoplastic medications moderate the pace
    of tumor development and postpone metastasis. The utilization and performance
    of the methods are discussed, with focus on the antineoplastic drugs. Streptomyces
    produces compounds and crude extracts which shows cytostatic reaction across different
    human cell lines like for breast carcinoma (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cell lines), (HepG2
    cell lines) hepatic carcinoma, (DU 145 cell lines) prostate cancer and more.
