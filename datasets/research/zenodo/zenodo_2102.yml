    peat mesocosms are linked to geochemistry

    there is a need to assess whether rewetting can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions, and notably how site-specific soil-geochemistry will influence differences
    in emission magnitudes. However, there are inconsistent results regarding the
    correlation of soil properties with heterotrophic respiration (R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;)
    of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;),
    and&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn more about nitrous oxide from ScienceDirect''s AI-generated

    oxide&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from bare peat. In this study,
    we determined 1) soil-, and site-specific geochemical components as drivers for
    emissions from R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;on five Danish&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn

    and 2) emission magnitudes under drained and rewetted conditions. For this, a&nbsp;&lt;a

    was performed under equal exposure to climatic conditions and water table depths
    controlled to either -40&nbsp;cm, or -5&nbsp;cm. For the drained soils, we found
    that annual cumulative emissions, accounting for all three gases, were dominated
    by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, contributing with, on average, 99&nbsp;% to a varying&nbsp;&lt;a

    lowered annual cumulative emissions from R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;by 3.2&ndash;5.1&nbsp;t

    fens and bogs, respectively, despite a high variability of site-specific CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;emissions,
    contributing with 0.3&ndash;3.4&nbsp;t CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;yr&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;to
    the GWP. Overall, analyses using generalized additive models (GAM) showed that
    emission magnitudes were well explained by geochemical variables. Under drained
    conditions, significant soil-specific predictor variables for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;flux
    magnitudes were pH, phosphorus (P), and the soil substrate&rsquo;s relative water
    holding capacity (WHC). When rewetted, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;emissions
    from R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&nbsp;were affected by pH, WHC, as well as contents
    of P, total carbon and nitrogen. In conclusion, our results found the highest
    GHG reduction on fen peatlands, further highlighting that peat nutrient status
    and acidity, and the potential availability of alternative electron acceptors,
    might be used as proxies for prioritising peatland areas for&nbsp;&lt;a title="Learn
