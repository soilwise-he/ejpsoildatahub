  title: Determination of the regularities of the soil punching process by the working
    body with the asymetric tip
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The presence of analytical dependencies describing the process
    of static soil puncture by a working body with a conical asymmetric tip is necessary
    to create installations with the ability to control the trajectory of the soil
    puncture.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The paper considers the features of the process of interaction of an
    asymmetric conical tip with the ground. Analytical relationships were obtained
    to determine its reactions during a static puncture, the deviation of the head
    trajectory from a straight line, to determine the size of the soil compaction
    zone and the magnitude of the destructive force that acts on adjacent communications
    and other underground objects. It was found that with an increase in the value
    of the displacement of the top of the cone, for example, from its axis from 0.02&nbsp;m
    to 0.08&nbsp;m with a borehole diameter of 0.2&nbsp;m, the value of soil resistance
    increases almost four&nbsp;times. The greatest resistance is achieved when piercing
    a hard sandy sand.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;It was found that with an increase in the displacement of the tip of
    the tip cone, the deviation of the trajectory increases. The piercing head achieves
    the greatest deviation from the straight trajectory of movement with a sharper
    cone and a greater asymmetric deviation of its top, and, for example, in hard
    sandy loam can be up to 0.17&nbsp;m with a span of 10&nbsp;m.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;It was found that the size of the soil destruction zone will be almost
    1.8&nbsp;times larger than the tip in the form of a symmetrical cone and reaches
    from 8 to 12 borehole diameters, depending on the type of soil. The maximum pressure
    on adjacent objects can reach from 0.06&nbsp;MPa in hard-plastic clay to 0.09&nbsp;MPa
    in hard sandy loam.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The calculated dependences obtained for determining the power and technological
    parameters depending on the geometric dimensions of the asymmetric tip of the
    working body can be used to create installations with a controlled static puncture
    for use in the most common soil conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
