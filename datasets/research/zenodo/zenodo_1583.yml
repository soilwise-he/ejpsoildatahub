  title: 'Soil Characterization and Classification: A Hybrid Approach of Computer
    Vision and Sensor Network'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This paper presents soil characterization and classification
    using computer vision &amp; sensor network approach. Gravity Analog Soil Moisture
    Sensor with arduino-uno and image processing is considered for classification
    and characterization of soils. For the data sets, Amhara regions and Addis Ababa
    city of Ethiopia are considered for this study. In this research paper the total
    of 6 group of soil and each having 90 images are used. That is, form these 540
    images were captured. Once the dataset is collected, pre-processing and noise
    filtering steps are performed to achieve the goal of the study through MATLAB,
    2013. Classification and characterization is performed through BPNN (Back-propagation
    neural network), the neural network consists of 7 inputs feature vectors and 6
    neurons in its output layer to classify soils. 89.7% accuracy is achieved when
    back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is used.&lt;/p&gt;'
