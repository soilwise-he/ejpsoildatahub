  title: Fine Scale Determinants of Soil Litter Fauna on a Mediterranean Mixed Oak
    Forest Invaded by the Exotic Soil-Borne Pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;There is growing recognition of the importance of soil fauna
    for modulating nutrient cycling processes such as litter decomposition. However,
    little is known about the drivers promoting changes in soil fauna abundance on
    a local scale. We explored this gap of knowledge in a mixed oak forest of Southern
    Spain, which is under decline due to the invasion of the exotic soil-borne pathogen&nbsp;Phytophthora
    cinnamomi. Meso-invertebrate abundance found in soil litter was estimated at the
    suborder level. We then explored their statistical correlations with respect to
    light availability, tree and litter characteristics, and&nbsp;P. cinnamomi&nbsp;abundance.
    Oribatida and Entomobryomporpha were the most abundant groups of Acari and Collembola,
    respectively. According to their trophic level, predator and detritivore abundances
    were positively correlated while detritivores were, in turn, positively correlated
    with pathogen abundance and negatively influenced by light availability and tree
    defoliation. These overall trends differed between groups. Among detritivores,
    Diplopoda preferred highly decomposed litter while Oribatida and Psocoptera preferred
    darker environments and Poduromorpha were selected for environments with lower
    tree defoliation. Our results show the predominant role of light availability
    in influencing litter fauna abundances at local scales and suggest that the invasive
    soil-borne pathogen&nbsp;P. cinnamomi&nbsp;is integrated in these complex relationships&lt;/p&gt;'
