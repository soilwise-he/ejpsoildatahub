  title: Soil assessment and mitigation of flash flood erosion using Ipomoe Carnea
    in Gombe town, Gombe state, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In many parts of the world floods occur more often
    and increase in size. In the tropics, it is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;partly or
    wholly caused by climatological factors,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;in-situ soil
    types (as soils with low infiltration rate are vulnerable to flooding); inadequate
    drainage network, topography and human factors. Gombe town is situated within
    an elevation of 628&nbsp;m and 361&nbsp;m above sea level (a.s.l). Topography
    is mainly mountainous, undulating and hilly with open plains&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and
    mean slope gradient of 5&deg;, considered to be a high gradient for unprotected
    soils. This&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;causes high surface runoff leading to excessive
    flooding and&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;formation of gullies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,
    cutting deep trenches that result in the destruction of residential houses and
    environmental disasters throughout Gombe town. The research work assessed gully
    erosion from high vulnerable sections in Gombe town affected by high fluvial floods.
    Field measurement was done using 50&nbsp;m tape, GPS, satellite images and laboratory
    analysis. Laboratory analysis of soil particles sizes showed that mean particle
    sizes were 74.9&nbsp;%, 14.1&nbsp;% and 11.0&nbsp;% for sand, silt and clay respectivly;
    the textural class for the entire study site was sandy clay. Porosity from the
    entire study area contains low volume of voids relative to the volume of solids.
    Bulk density was slightly high&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;compared to the standards
    values. The&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;soil chemical properties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;of
    the&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;il pH for the entire site
    mean (ESM) was 6.42. This indicates that the soils are slightly acidic which affect
    microbial activities on organic matter that enhance the binding of soils to resists
    erosivity of fluvial floods. People resorts to using vegetative cover of Ipomoe
    Carnea plant as mitigation measures to protect their vulnerable houses and farms
    from gully erosions because the stems interweaves and forms a thick cover that
    diffuses the high velocity water flow into laminar flow. The weaved stems traps,
    blocks and prevents the flood transported materials(soil, humus, gravels) in between
    the stems thereby prevents and slows soil erosion to the nearest minimum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
