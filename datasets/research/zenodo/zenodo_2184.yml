  title: Toxicity of bitumen on soil fertility bacteria - Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas
    from Tekulu Waterside, Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Toxicity of bitumen on Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter from Tekulu Waterside,\
    \ Bodo in Gokana Local government area of Ogoni, Rivers State, Nigeria was carried\
    \ out using standard analytical procedures. The density, API and flash point of\
    \ the bitumen used in this study at 15\xB0C was 0.9898 g/cm3, API at 60\xB0F value\
    \ of 11.46 and >200\xB0C respectively. The total TPH and PAH constituent of the\
    \ bitumen was 20,549.77 mg/L and 924.09 mg/L respectively. Analysis of the effect\
    \ of different concentration (50 mg/L, 250 mg/L, 500 mg/L, 750 mg/L and 1000 mg/L)\
    \ of bitumen on Nitrosomonas sp. over a period (24hrs, 48hrs. 72hrs and 96hrs)\
    \ revealed that the mortality of the organism increased as the concentration of\
    \ the toxicant. The mortality was also affected by the duration of exposure. The\
    \ probit analysis on the lethal concentration (LC10, LC20\_and LC50) of the bitumen\
    \ on Nitrosomonas sp. was 223.32 mg/L, 369.682 mg/L and 969.622 mg/L respectively\
    \ and Nitrobacter sp. 587.837 mg/L, 765.74 mg/L and 1269.841 mg/L respectively,\
    \ when exposed for 96 hours revealed a varying mortality status. The LC50\_of\
    \ the bitumen on Nitrosomonas sp. peaked at 48hrs. The study shows that bitumen\
    \ was more toxic to Nitrosomonas than Nitrobacter sp. based on the findings of\
    \ the study, it is recommended that test organisms (Nitrosomonas\_sp. and\_Nitrobacter\
    \ sp.) could serve as a potential tool for eco-toxicological assay and pollution\
    \ biomarker."
