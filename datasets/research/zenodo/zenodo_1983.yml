  title: Soil erosion assessment in the Blue Nile Basin driven by a novel RUSLE-GEE
    framework
  abstract: "Assessment of soil loss and understanding its major drivers are essential\
    \ to implement targeted management interventions. We have proposed and developed\
    \ a Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation framework fully implemented in the Google\
    \ Earth Engine cloud platform (RUSLE-GEE) for high spatial resolution (90 m) soil\
    \ erosion assessment. Using RUSLE-GEE, we analyzed the soil loss rate for different\
    \ erosion levels, land cover types, and slopes in the Blue Nile Basin. The results\
    \ showed that the mean soil loss rate is 39.73, 57.98, and 6.40 t ha<sup>\u2212\
    1</sup> yr<sup>\u22121</sup> for the entire Blue Nile, Upper Blue Nile, and Lower\
    \ Blue Nile Basins, respectively. Our results also indicated that soil protection\
    \ measures should be implemented in approximately 27% of the Blue Nile Basin,\
    \ as these areas face a moderate to high risk of erosion (&gt;10 t ha<sup>\u2212\
    1</sup> yr<sup>\u22121</sup> ). In addition, downscaling the Tropical RainfallMeasuring\
    \ Mission (TRMM) precipitation data from 25 km to 1 km spatial resolution significantly\
    \ impacts rainfall erosivity and soil loss rate. In terms of soil erosion assessment,\
    \ the study showed the rapid characterization of soil loss rates that could be\
    \ used to prioritize erosion mitigation plans to support sustainable land resources\
    \ and tackle land degradation in the Blue Nile Basin."
