  title: Emissions of CO2 from downed logs of different species and the surrounding
    soil in temperate forest
  abstract: 'The decomposition of deadwood plays a very important role in the functioning
    of the forest ecosystem. The present study was conducted with the objectives to:
    (1) determine the amount of deadwood respiration depending on species and degree
    of decomposition; (2) determine the extent of the impact of decomposing wood on
    the amount of respiration in surrounding soil; (3) find a relationship between
    the amount of respiration and the chemical fractional composition of soil organic
    matter. Our research has shown that respiration of decaying wood samples was 2-3
    times lower compared to soil, regardless of the type of wood and the degree of
    wood decomposition. The conducted analyses confirmed the influence of the species
    of wood and the degree of decomposition on the respiration rate in wood samples.
    More decomposed wood (4th and 5th degree of decomposition) releases more CO<sub>2</sub>
    compared to less decomposed wood and the highest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were
    recorded for aspen and alder wood. Better understanding of the mechanisms and
    factors affecting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in forest ecosystem can help reduce
    climate change.'
