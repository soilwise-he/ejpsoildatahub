  title: Impact of the chemical composition of applied organic materials on bacterial
    and archaeal community compositions in paddy soil
  abstract: In paddy fields where rice is grown under waterlogged conditions, soil
    microorganisms play an important role in soil biochemical processes. Their activities
    are sensitive indicators that reflect the quality and productivity of paddy soil.
    Microcosm experiments were performed to investigate the effect of organic material
    composition on soil bacterial and archaeal communities under paddy soil conditions.
    Rice straw and farmyard manure were used as the original organic materials, and
    three types of residues were prepared by sequential extraction from the original
    materials. The organic material application did not affect soil pH and redox potential
    (Eh). The alpha diversities of bacterial and archaeal communities were significantly
    affected by organic material type, chemical component differences, and the incubation
    period. The relative abundance of Clostridiaceae and Bacillaceae increased in
    the microcosms treated with rice straw and farmyard manure, respectively, suggesting
    that they are important bacterial groups that may facilitate degradation of easily
    degradable organic fractions under waterlogged and anaerobic soil conditions.
    In the archaeal communities, the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens
    (Methanosarcinaceae) was increased by rice straw application. Principal coordinate
    analysis based on the weighted UniFrac distances showed that the application of
    rice straw caused greater changes in the soil bacterial and archaeal communities
    than farmyard manure. The bacterial and archaeal communities in the microcosms
    treated with organic materials differed even after lipid and water-soluble sugar
    extraction depending on the type of the original organic materials used; however,
    when hemicellulose-free materials were applied, the bacterial and archaeal community
    composition changed similarly during incubation. These results suggest that the
    difference in the proportions of hemicelluloses in rice straw and farmyard manure
    was the most significant factor in changing the bacterial and archaeal community
    compositions differently. Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship
    between the differences in the constituents of organic materials applied to paddy
    soil and changes in the community compositions of bacteria and archaea involved
    in the decomposition process.
