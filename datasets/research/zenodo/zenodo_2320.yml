  title: Determination of Acceptable Values of the Device Parameters that Measure
    the Working Depth of Soil Working Machines
  abstract: "In the article, it is noted that a device for mechanized measurement\
    \ of the working depth of soil tillage machines has been developed, and the results\
    \ of multi-factor experiments conducted to determine the optimal values of the\
    \ main parameters affecting its measurement accuracy (the diameter of the parallelogram\
    \ mechanism, the width of the hub and the vertical load applied to it) are presented.\
    \ Multivariate experiments were conducted according to plan V4. In this case,\
    \ the absolute value of the difference between the average values of the processing\
    \ depth determined by the existing method and device was taken as an evaluation\
    \ criterion.The data obtained in the experiments were processed by the \"planexp\"\
    \ program and a regression equation was obtained that adequately represents the\
    \ evaluation criterion. Cochran's criterion was used to evaluate the uniformity\
    \ of variance, Student's criterion was used to evaluate the value of regression\
    \ coefficients, and Fisher's criterion was used to evaluate the adequacy of theregression\
    \ model. According to the obtained regression equation, the device for mechanized\
    \ measurement of the working depth of soil tillage machines -in order to measure\
    \ their working depth with high accuracy, the diameterof the base wheel is 37.19-38-34\
    \ cm, the width of the axle is 12.94-13.43 cm, and the vertical it was determined\
    \ that the loading should be in the range of 192.34-201.0 N\_"
