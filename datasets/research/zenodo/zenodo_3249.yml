  title: "Rice cum Fish culture (Rizi \u2013 Pisciculture) based farming systems \u2013\
    \ A way forward for climate resilient Agriculture to enhance soil, crop and farm\
    \ productivity and nutritional security of the marginal farmers"
  abstract: "Climate resilience indicators are said to be improved when productivity-enhancing\
    \ interventions combined with water management, soil health, livelihood diversification,\
    \ and food and nutrition security. Integrated farming systems (IFS) is normally\
    \ viewed as a sustainable alternative for enhancing livelihood security of small\
    \ and marginal farmers. Apart from land holding size, another major hurdles in\
    \ adopting IFS are marketing of low volume farm products under small farmers holdings.\
    \ Normally, the farm families never stay in the field where the system will be\
    \ developed. Hence feeding the animals, birds would be very difficult and the\
    \ security of the different components also remains a big challenge. Hence an\
    \ alternate farming system which integrates an enterprise in the rice field to\
    \ promote higher farm productivity with minimal risk was evaluated for three years\
    \ from 2020. The cropping system adopted was green manure (Daincha) \u2013 Rice\
    \ \u2013 Blackgram. The average addition of N, P and K through green manure was\
    \ 120, 20 and 40 kg/ha respectively, provided a substantial portion of NPK requirement\
    \ for rice and also add organic matter (OM) to maintain soil fertility. Further\
    \ inclusion of azolla in the rice field, which gave a mean biomass of 8 t/ha in\
    \ the rice fields provided a substantial amount of nitrogen for rice growth and\
    \ reduces weed infestations. Rice- Fish -Duck system contributes increase in organic\
    \ fertilization by duck excreta, which added 20 kg N, 10 kg P and 8 kg K/ha per\
    \ season. Due to bioturbation of duck, the number of tillers/m2 in Rice-Azolla-Fish-Duck\
    \ system was significantly improved and there by resulted in a yield increase\
    \ of 12.17 percent as compared to Rice alone. The additional income through 1600\
    \ kg of fish/ha, duck meat of 400 kg/ha and 3500 eggs eventually led to a BCR\
    \ of 2.73 as compared to 1.91 under rice alone. The percentage of stem borer incidence\
    \ were drastically reduced due to fish. The ducks and fish bioturbation (rapid\
    \ movement) and presence of azolla in the rice ecosystem had reduced the methane\
    \ emission with no significant change in CO2 emission. The outcome of the study\
    \ indicated that rice-fish- azolla- duck farming system provides soil security,\
    \ food security and nutrient security besides increasing farm profitability."
