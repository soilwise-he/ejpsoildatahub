  title: Moisture content investigation in the soil samples using microwave dielectric
    constant measurement method
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The microwaves of typical frequency ranges of 3 GHz to 30 GHz
    have been in use for remote sensing applications which are progressing rapidly.
    The microwaves can sense existing moisture in any material that absorbs moisture
    such as soil or vegetation. In case of soils which may be comprised of variable
    mix proportionate of solids, liquids or gases and distinct textures subjected
    to the associated size and the arrangements of soil particles. Hence, the moisture
    absorption by a specific type of soil used to be different. The inherent physical
    and electrical properties such as color, texture, grains, dielectric constant,
    conductivity or permeability, etc. differentiate various soils. In this work,
    authors present soil moisture measurement by simple estimation of emissivity i.e.
    the ratio of energy radiated by an object to absorbing the body of same physical
    temperature. A strategic method of measuring dielectric constant using a microwave
    signal is used in this research work. The measurement of the dielectric constant
    of the soils collected from the specific regions and analysis of results has been
    reported. The proposed method is less complex and can further be used for the
    identification of soil moisture and agricultural applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
