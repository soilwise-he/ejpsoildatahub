  title: Vermicompost Induced Phytoremediation of Heavy Metals Copper and Chromium
    Contaminated Soil by  the Plant Sesamum indicum L
  abstract: 'The effect of vermicompost in phytoremediation of heavy metals copper
    and chromium in a contaminated soil by the plant Sesamum indicum L was studied.
    The experiment has been carried for a short period to understand the process of
    heavy metal extraction or removal while plant growth for both metals Cu and Cr.
    The vermicompost-heavy metal (different doses) mixed with soil and taken as a
    media for plant cultivation. Among the different doses (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 ppm)
    the plants were shown a considerable growth till 10ppm in both metals. The length
    of root and shoot of plants indicates the effective growth due to the usage of
    vermicompost and lower heavy metal doses (0, 5, 10 ppm). But the growth rate decreases
    with the increased doses (20, 40 ppm) of both heavy metals Cu and Cr. Similar
    results were also obtained in dry weight of root and shoot of the sesame plant
    in high doses for both metals. Higher amount of metal accumulation in plants made
    an adverse effect in physiological, metabolic activities which result in shunt
    growth and decreased dry weight (biomass). The high concentration of metals (Cr
    and CO) accumulates in shoots than any other parts of the plant which clearly
    indicate the metals removed from the given contaminated soil medium by the plant
    Sesamum indicum L. According to the present study the plant S.indicum L efficiently
    remove the heavy metals chromium and copper from the contaminated soil and it
    also has the ability to accumulate the heavy in their parts while growing. The
    efficiency of accumulation enhanced by addition of vermicompost. Hence it is concluded
    that the plant S.indicum L can be used in phytoremation for heavy metal pollution.
