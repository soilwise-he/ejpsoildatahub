  title: DOES THE PERMANENT PERMANENCE OF SOIL DEPEND ON THE TREATMENT METHODS?
  abstract: The importance of soil water permeability in obtaining high yields from
    agricultural crops is that the better it is, the more favorable the environment
    will be for the growth and development of plants. This ensures high yields from
    crops. In particular, summer tillage methods have different effects on its agrophysical
    and water permeability properties. As a result, each variant is formed under specific
    soil conditions, and the planted repeat crops grow and develop differently. This
    also affects their productivity.
