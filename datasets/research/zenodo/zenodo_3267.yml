  title: Influence of grain size, organic carbon and organic matter residue content
    on the sorption of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in aqueous film forming
    foam contaminated soils - Implications for remediation using soil washing
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;A soil that was historically contaminated with Aqueous Film Forming Foam
    (AFFF) was dry sieved into size fractions&lt;br&gt;

    representative of those produced during soil washing. Batch sorption tests were
    then conducted to investigate the&lt;br&gt;

    effect of soil parameters on in situ per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
    sorption of these different size fractions:&lt;br&gt;

    &lt; 0.063 mm, 0.063 to 0.5 mm, 0.5 to 2 mm, 2 to 4 mm, 4 to 8 mm, and soil organic
    matter residues (SOMR). PFOS&lt;br&gt;

    (513 ng/g), 6:2 FTS (132 ng/g) and PFHxS (58 ng/g) were the most dominant PFAS
    in the AFFF contaminated soil.&lt;br&gt;

    Non-spiked, in situ Kd values for 19 PFAS ranged from 0.2 to 138 L/Kg (log Kd
    &minus;0.8 to 2.14) for the bulk soil and&lt;br&gt;

    were dependant on the head group and perfluorinated chain length (spanning C4
    to C13). The Kd values increased&lt;br&gt;

    with decreasing grain size and increasing organic carbon content (OC), which were
    correlated to each other. For example,&lt;br&gt;

    the PFOS Kd value for silt and clay (&lt; 0.063mm, 17.1 L/Kg, log Kd 1.23) were
    approximately 30 times higher compared&lt;br&gt;

    to the gravel fraction (4 to 8 mm, 0.6 L/Kg, log Kd&minus;0.25). The highest PFOS
    Kd value (116.6 L/Kg, log Kd 2.07)&lt;br&gt;

    was found for the SOMRfraction, which had the highest OC content. Koc values for
    PFOS ranged from6.9 L/Kg (log Koc&lt;br&gt;

    0.84) for the gravel fraction to 1906 L/Kg (log Koc 3.28) for the silt and clay,
    indicating that the mineral composition of&lt;br&gt;

    the different size fractions also influenced sorption. The results here emphasize
    the need to separate coarse-grained&lt;br&gt;

    fractions and fine-grained fractions, and in particular the SOMR, to optimize
    the soil washing process. Higher Kd values&lt;br&gt;

    for the smaller size fractions indicate that coarser soils are better suited for
    soil washing.&lt;/p&gt;'
