  title: 'RISK ASSESSMENT OF LEAD IN SOIL: AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO CALCULATE MAXIMUM
    TOLERABLE LEVELS'
  abstract: Based on the Soil Protection Act, the necessity of remediation is determined
    on the basis of intervention values, which were arrived at by modelling the potential
    risk that contaminated soil poses for humans and the ecosystem. The remediation
    urgency is determined by means of a risk assessment that includes site-specific
    information. According to this methodology, the diffuse contamination of urban
    areas with lead may form an actual risk for young children. Critical examination
    however showed that this outcome is based on conservative model assumptions. Using
    an alternative approach based on a mass balance study of lead in children, it
    was calculated that actual risks are only expected to occur at levels that are
    higher than the Dutch intervention values.
