  title: 'Control of the white mango scale Aulacaspis tubercularis (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha:
    Diaspididae) with systemic soil drenching insecticides and pruning in greater
    than ten years old mangos in western Ethiopia'
  abstract: The white mango scale insect (WMS), <em>Aulacaspis tubercularis</em> Newstead,
    1906 is a key pest of mango in Ethiopia, which has been spreading throughout the
    country since its introduction in 2010. Evaluation of the efficacy of two systemic
    soil drenching insecticides (thiamethoxam 25 % WG and imidacloprid 35 % SC) independently,
    and in combination with tree management (pruning) for the control of the WMS was
    conducted under field conditions in western Ethiopia in two locations in 2018
    and 2019. Randomized complete block designs with three replications were used
    for the experiments. In the first site, all treatments resulted in scale populations
    that were significantly lower than the control (1086 crawlers and females per
    leaf). Thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning resulted in the lowest number
    of the WMS after the second treatment (43.5 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam
    25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, which was statistically similar. In the second
    site, imidacloprid 35 % SC + thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, resulted
    in the lowest mean number of the WMS (31.1 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam
    25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning (61.4 per leaf). This treatment also gave the highest
    percentage reduction in number of the WMS compared to the WMS counting before
    treatment application. This study has shown that use of systemic insecticides
    and pruning are promising control tactics for the WMS. Cost implications and effects
    of the insecticides on the natural enemy complex and residual toxicity in fruits
    need to be evaluated.
