  title: Relationships Between Microbial Parameters and Soil Properties in a Hydrophobic
    Spolic Technosol
  abstract: "Data on microbiology of water repellent (hydrophobic) soils in Bulgaria\
    \ are scarce. This work aimed to find out relations between microbiological indicators,\
    \ hydrophobicity level and other soil properties in a Spolic Technosol. Samples\
    \ from 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil depth of a fly ash reclaimed soil covered with\
    \ tuft vegetation and located near Obruchiste area were collected. Main microbiological\
    \ (basal respiration - BR, microbial biomass carbon content -Cmic, amount of main\
    \ microbial groups \u2013CFU), chemical (organic carbon, available N, P and K\
    \ contents) and physical (hydrophobicity level, moisture, sand and clay contents)\
    \ properties were determined. It was found that the Technosol was hydrophobic\
    \ in most of the monitoring points. Half of the samples were severely or extremely\
    \ hydrophobic (assessed by water-drop-penetration time) and the hydrophobicity\
    \ level was higher in the subsurface layer. The Spolic Techosol under tuft vegetation\
    \ was characterized with low numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes\
    \ and oligotrophic microorganisms (1-40 x 102 CFU/g) at 0-20 cm depth. As a whole,\
    \ low BR rate (0.51-5.43 mg CO2/g/ 24h) and low Cmic values (2.37-18.18 mg C/100g)\
    \ were established for both layers. Weak relationships of microbial parameters\
    \ with organic carbon, humic acid, fulvic acid and clay contents were noticed\
    \ in this soil. Significant correlations of the amount of fungi and actinomycetes\
    \ with available nutrient and moisture contents were found. In general, a trend\
    \ of positive relationships of fungi, actinomycetes and cellulolytic microorganisms\
    \ with soil hydrophobicity was established. The relative parts of fungi and actinomycetes\
    \ increased in the hydrophobic samples comparing to non-hydrophobic ones. Microbial\
    \ biomass carbon tended to increase with increasing the hydrophobicity level.\
    \ Data pointed on close positive relationships of microbial parameters studied\
    \ with the hydrophobicity in this Technosol. Our results add new information to\
    \ the monitoring study of hydrophobic Technosols from Maritsa-Iztok coal-mining\
    \ region (Bulgaria)."
