  title: 'Conservation Agriculture Practice In Bangladesh: Farmers'' Socioeconomic
    Status And Soil Environment Perspective'
  abstract: "The study was conducted to assess the impact of conservation agriculture\
    \ practice on farmers\u2019 socioeconomic condition and soil environmental quality\
    \ in Bangladesh. A total of 450 (i.e., 50 focal, 150 proximal and 250 control)\
    \ farmers from five districts were selected for this study. Descriptive statistics\
    \ like sum, averages, percentages, etc. were calculated to evaluate the socioeconomic\
    \ data. Using Enyedi\u2019s crop productivity index, it was found that the crop\
    \ productivity of focal, proximal and control farmers was increased by 0.9, 1.2\
    \ and 1.3 percent, respectively. The result of DID (Difference-in-difference)\
    \ analysis indicated that the impact of conservation agriculture practice on farmers\u2019\
    \ average annual income was significant. Multidimensional poverty index (MPI)\
    \ indicates that poverty in terms of deprivation of health, education and living\
    \ standards was decreased; and a remarkable improvement in farmers\u2019 socioeconomic\
    \ status was found after adopting conservation agriculture practice. Most of the\
    \ focal and proximal farmers stated about increased soil environmental condition\
    \ where majority of control farmers stated about constant environmental condition\
    \ in this regard. The Probit model reveals that minimum tillage operation, permanent\
    \ organic soil cover, and application of compost and vermicompost were found significant\
    \ factors affecting soil environmental quality under conservation agriculture.\
    \ Input support, motivation, training programmes and extension services are recommended\
    \ to implement in order to raise the awareness and enrich the knowledge of the\
    \ farmers on conservation agriculture practice."
