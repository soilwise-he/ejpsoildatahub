  title: Phytoremediation Potential Of Native Plants Growing On A Heavy Metals Contaminated
    Soil Of Copper Mine In Iran
  abstract: 'A research project dealing with the phytoremediation

    of a soil polluted by some heavy metals is currently running. The

    case study is represented by a mining area in Hamedan province in

    the central west part of Iran. The potential of phytoextraction and

    phytostabilization of plants was evaluated considering the

    concentration of heavy metals in the plant tissues and also the

    bioconcentration factor (BCF) and the translocation factor (TF). Also

    the several established criteria were applied to define

    hyperaccumulator plants in the studied area. Results showed that

    none of the collected plant species were suitable for phytoextraction

    of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn, but among the plants, Euphorbia macroclada

    was the most efficient in phytostabilization of Cu and Fe, while,

    Ziziphora clinopodioides, Cousinia sp. and Chenopodium botrys

    were the most suitable for phytostabilization of Zn and Chondrila

    juncea and Stipa barbata had the potential for phytostabilization of

    Mn. Using the most common criterion, Euphorbia macroclada and

    Verbascum speciosum were Fe hyperaccumulator plants. Present

    study showed that native plant species growing on contaminated sites

    may have the potential for phytoremediation.'
