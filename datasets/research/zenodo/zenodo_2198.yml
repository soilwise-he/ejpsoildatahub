  title: Effect Of Phosphorus Fertilizer On Some Soil Chemical Properties And Nitrogen
    Fixation Of Legumes At Bauchi
  abstract: Research was conducted during the 2004, 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons
    to study the effect of phosphorus fertilizer on some soil chemical properties
    and nitrogen fixation of legumes at Bauchi. Composite soil samples were collected
    from sites before planting and after harvesting at the depths of 0-15 and 15-30cm.
    The treatment consisted of legumes namely; cowpea local variety (Yar Sokoto),
    groundnuts (Ex-Dakar) and soybean (TGX1448-2E) and four levels of phosphorus fertilizer
    (0, 13.2, 26.4 and 39.6kgP/ha). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design (RCBD) with three replications. The result shows that soil pH., organic
    carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus increased in the soil samples
    collected after harvesting as compared to the soils sample before planting across
    the depths. Phosphorus fertilizer application significantly (P=0.05) increase
    nitrogen fixation up to 26.4kgP/ha, but decline significantly (P=0.05) at higher
    levels of 39.6kgP/ha in the cropping seasons. Legumes differ significantly (P=0.05)
    in their ability to fixed nitrogen, with soybean fixing the highest amount of
    nitrogen in the cropping seasons. Interaction between phosphorus fertilizer application
    and legumes show that in 2004 cropping seasons the application of 13.2kgP/ha gave
    significantly (P=0.05) the same amount of nitrogen fixed irrespective of the legumes,
    but in 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons, the interaction shows that at 0kgP/ha phosphorus
    levels of the amount of nitrogen fixed by the legumes was significantly the same.
    It is concluded that the application of phosphorus fertilizer did not only increase
    the nutrient status of the soil but enhance the nitrogen fixation ability of the
    legumes for a sustainable legume production and soil fertility management at Bauchi
