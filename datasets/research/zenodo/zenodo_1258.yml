  title: Risk Assessment Of Cobber And Zinc From Feed To Soil And Food
  abstract: "The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has requested a risk assessment of\
    \ cobber and zinc from feed to soil and food from the Norwegian Scientific Committee\
    \ for Food Safety. <br>\nCopper and zinc are added to feed as essential nutrients.\
    \ Samples from manure have shown that there is a high content of copper and zinc\
    \ in manure, and there is therefore a need to know the long-term effects of repeated\
    \ addition of manure to agricultural land. <br>\n <br>\nAt the same time there\
    \ is a need to know the risk for animal health and welfare if the amount of copper\
    \ and zinc in feed is reduced. <br>\n <br>\nThe VKM Panel on Animal Feed is responsible\
    \ for carrying out this assessment."
