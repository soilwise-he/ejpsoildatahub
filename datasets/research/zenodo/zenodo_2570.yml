  title: Comparison of test results to determine the parameters of soil strength to
    ensure the stability of earth slopes
  abstract: "The content of large soil fractions in soils complicates the experimental\
    \ part of the research, but, the modeling method makes it possible to determine\
    \ the effect of soil filler on slope stability.\n\n\nThe article presents the\
    \ results of experimental study of the strength of coarse-clastic soils with different\
    \ percentages of large fractions of gravelly soil (up to 20\_mm) and aggregate\
    \ (up to 5\_mm) in the study of slope stability. The studies were carried out\
    \ on three types of experimental equipment, which confirms the reliability of\
    \ the results obtained. Recommendations are given for applying the values of the\
    \ strength characteristics of coarse-grained soils in calculating the stability\
    \ of slopes.\n\n\nThe results of the tests are carried out in a tray and shear\
    \ testing devices. Mixture of soil fractions from 2\_mm to 50\_mm. Purpose of\
    \ the tests is to determine the actual parameters of soil strength j and C, taking\
    \ into account the effect of impurities on the stability of slopes.\n\n\nReliability\
    \ of the results confirmed the comparability of the results of previous tests.\
    \ Tray allows for testing models of slopes composed of mixtures of sand fractions\
    \ from 2\_mm to 20\_mm. Model sizes slopes are defined relative to the size tray.\
    \ Tray dimensions \u2011 length 1400\_mm, width 500\_mm, height 1000\_mm.\n\n\n\
    The design of the shear device allows to investigate coarse soils of different\
    \ factions. The diameter of the fractions were tested for shear device area of\
    \ 100\_sm2 is from 2\_mm to 20\_mm.\n\n\nThe diameter of the fractions were tested\
    \ for shear device area of 1000\_sm2 \u2011 from 5\_mm to 50\_mm. The experiments\
    \ were performed in the laboratory \"Geotechnics in Construction\" in KazGASA."
