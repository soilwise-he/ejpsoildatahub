  title: 'The Basics of Biochar: A Natural Soil Amendment'
  abstract: Biochar is a fine-grained, highly porous charcoal substance that is distinguished
    from other charcoals in its intended use as a soil amendment. Biochar is charcoal
    that has been produced under conditions that optimize certain characteristics
    deemed useful in agriculture, such as high surface area per unit of volume and
    low amounts of residual resins. The particular heat treatment of organic biomass
    used to produce biochar contributes to its large surface area and its characteristic
    ability to persist in soils with very little biological decay (Lehmann and Rondon
    2006). While raw organic materials supply nutrients to plants and soil microorganisms,
    biochar serves as a catalyst that enhances plant uptake of nutrients and water.
    Compared to other soil amendments, the high surface area and porosity of biochar
    enable it to adsorb or retain nutrients and water and also provide a habitat for
    beneficial microorganisms to flourish (Glaser et al. 2002, Lehmann and Rondon
    2006, Warnock et al. 2007).
