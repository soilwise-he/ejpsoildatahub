  title: 'Microplastics in terrestrial environments: Reviewing current understanding
    to determine the positive and negative aspects of soil'
  abstract: Plastic production and disposal have grown to be serious issues for the
    future of the world. The long lifespan and extensive use of synthetic polymers
    have contributed to the occurrence of plastic waste in the environment on a global
    scale. Plastic, which can be found in soils, species that live in and around soil,
    and adjacent to plants, is a novel stressor. There is very little known about
    the prevalence of microplastics in terrestrial systems. This paper provides an
    extensive overview of the current understanding of the causes, manifestations,
    impact and dangers of microplastic pollution in terrestrial (agricultural) settings.
