  title: 'Soil As Natural Heat Resource For Very Shallow Geothermal Application: Laboratory
    And Test Site Updates From Iter Project'
  abstract: 'Nowadays renewable energy resources for heating/cooling residential and
    tertiary buildings and agricultural<br>

    greenhouses are becoming increasingly important. In this framework, a possible,
    natural and valid alternative for<br>

    thermal energy supply is represented by soils.<br>

    In fact, since 1980 soils have been studied and used also as heat reservoir in
    geothermal applications, acting as a<br>

    heat source (in winter) or sink (in summer) coupled mainly with heat pumps.<br>

    Therefore, the knowledge of soil thermal properties and of heat and mass transfer
    in the soils plays an important<br>

    role in modeling the performance, reliability and environmental impact in the
    short and long term of engineering<br>

    applications.<br>

    However, the soil thermal behavior varies with soil physical characteristics such
    as soil texture and water content.<br>

    The available data are often scattered and incomplete for geothermal applications,
    especially very shallow<br>

    geothermal systems (up to 10 m depths), so it is worthy of interest a better comprehension
    of how the different<br>

    soil typologies (i.e. sand, loamy sand...) affect and are affected by the heat
    transfer exchange with very shallow<br>

    geothermal installations (i.e. horizontal collector systems and special forms).<br>

    Taking into consideration these premises, the ITER Project (Improving Thermal
    Efficiency of horizontal ground<br>

    heat exchangers, http://iter-geo.eu/), funded by European Union, is here presented.<br>

    An overview of physical-thermal properties variations under different moisture
    and load conditions for different<br>

    mixtures of natural material is shown, based on laboratory and field test data.
    The test site, located in Eltersdorf,<br>

    near Erlangen (Germany), consists of 5 trenches, filled in each with a different
    material, where 5 helix have been<br>

    installed in an horizontal way instead of the traditional vertical option.'
