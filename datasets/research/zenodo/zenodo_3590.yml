  title: The Effects Of Rain And Overland Flow Powers On Agricultural Soil Erodibility
  abstract: 'The purpose of this investigation is to relate the rain

    power and the overland flow power to soil erodibility to assess the

    effects of both parameters on soil erosion using variable rainfall

    intensity on remoulded agricultural soil. Six rainfall intensities were

    used to simulate the natural rainfall and are as follows: 12.4mm/h,

    20.3mm/h, 28.6mm/h, 52mm/h, 73.5mm/h and 103mm/h. The results

    have shown that the relationship between overland flow power and

    rain power is best represented by a linear function (R2=0.99). As

    regards the relationships between soil erodibility factor and rain and

    overland flow powers, the evolution of both parameters with the

    erodibility factor follow a polynomial function with high coefficient

    of determination. From their coefficients of determination (R2=0.95)

    for rain power and (R2=0.96) for overland flow power, we can

    conclude that the flow has more power to detach particles than rain.

    This could be explained by the fact that the presence of particles,

    already detached by rain and transported by the flow, give the flow

    more weight and then contribute to the detachment of particles by

    collision.'
