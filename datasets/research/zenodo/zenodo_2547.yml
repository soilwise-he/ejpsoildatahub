  title: 'SYNERGISTIC RECYCLING OF DETERIORATED LATERITE SOIL AND FLY ASH AS GEOPOLYMER
    PRECURSORS: UPSCALING FROM BINDERS TO SUSTAINABLE BRICKS'
  abstract: Globallysustainabilityisthemajorchallengeforamaterialconstructionindustryin
    termsofmeetingecofriendlydemands.Similarly relevant provocation is expected in
    anthropogenic activitieslike waste management in thermal power plants. In this
    study, in thelight of industrial conversation appeal, two wastes, namely laterite
    soiland fly ash, generated through intensive and prolonged weathering ofthe underlying
    parent rock and operation of thermal power plant, wereused in a synergistic way
    in the preparation of sustainable geopolymerbinders. In order to assure a productive
    balance between the variousperiodicalevolutionofbuildingmaterialsdemandandwastesproduction,
    sustainable bricks have been regarded as optimum potentialapproach. In this regard,
    mix proportions and curing conditions wereinitiallyoptimized.Particularly,geopolymerisationkineticswereevaluated
    by varying the molarities of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) andsodiumsilicate(Na2SiO3)asfunctionofcuringperiod.Themechanical,
    durability and microstructural characterization of binderswere assessed to identify
    the influence of curing conditions (Elevatedtemperature) and mix proportions on
    the engineering performance and,afterwards,the productwasupscaled toatypical building
    brick.
