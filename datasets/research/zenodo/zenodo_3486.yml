  title: Electrokinetic Remediation Of Uranium Contaminated Soil By Ion Exchange Membranes
  abstract: The contamination of significant quantities of soils and sediments with
    uranium and other actinide elements as a result of nuclear activity poses many
    environmental risks. The electrokinetic process is one of the most promising remediation
    techniques for sludge, sediment, and saturated or unsaturated soils contaminated
    with heavy metals and radionuclides. However, secondary waste is a major concern
    for soil contaminated with nuclides. To minimize the generation of secondary wastes,
    this study used the anion and cation exchange membranes to improve the performance
    of the experimental apparatus. Remediation experiments of uranium-contaminated
    soil were performed with different agents. The results show that using acetic
    acid and EDTA as chelating agents clearly enhances the migration ability of the
    uranium. The ion exchange membranes (IEMs) used in the experiments not only reduce
    secondary wastes, but also, keep the soil pH stable.
