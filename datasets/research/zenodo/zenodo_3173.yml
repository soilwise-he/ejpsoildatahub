  title: Prediction of Subgrade Strength from Index Properties of Expansive Soil Stabilized
    with Bagasse Ash and Calcined Termite Clay Powder Using Artificial Neural Network
    and Regression
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;When moisture levels fluctuate, expansive soils lose a large
    amount of volume. During the rainy and dry seasons, this type of soil expands
    and contracts, respectively. As a result, such problematic soils should be avoided
    or appropriately managed when encountered as subgrade materials. The strength
    of the subgrade is measured in terms of its California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value
    which is tiresome, uneconomical, and time-consuming to determine in the laboratory.
    The present study investigated the effect of bagasse ash (BA) and calcined termite
    clay powder (CTCP) on the strength, index, and microstructural properties of expansive
    soil. Laboratory tests such as Atterberg&rsquo;s limits, particle size analysis,
    moisture-density relationship, and CBR tests were performed on the highly expansive
    soil and blended with 3%, 5%, 7%, 9%, and 11% bagasse ash (BA), and 5%, 10%, 15%,
    20%, and 25% CTCP separately and in combination. In addition, the microstructural
    properties of the raw, highly expansive soil and the soil stabilized with the
    optimum BA-CTCP combination were analyzed using the Scanning Electron Microscopy
    (SEM) machine. Soaked CBR prediction models were also developed using multiple
    linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) from the BA fraction
    (BAF), CTCP fraction (CTCPF), liquid limit (LL), plasticity index (PI), optimum
    moisture content (OMC), and maximum dry density (MDD). The soil under study was
    very weak, having a CBR value of 2.2% and a group index (GI) of 64.37 (reported
    as 20), and highly expansive with a PI of 51.61% and LL of 104.32%. The addition
    of both BA and CTCP separately and in combination resulted in the reduction of
    PI and increased the strength of the soil under study. As compared with the individual
    effect, the combined effect of BA and CTCP was quite significant. The free-swell
    index test result determined the optimum BA and CTCP combination; a 72.5% reduction
    was observed when blended with a combination of 9% BA and 20% CTCP. Thus, 9% BA
    and 20% CTCP compositions could be the optimum percentage combination to stabilize
    the highly expansive soil under study. The PI was decreased by 85.75%, and the
    CBR became 5.5 times greater when it was stabilized with 11% BA + 25% CTCP. The
    SEM micrographs showed that the morphology and fabric of the control specimen
    (raw soil) were significantly changed when the soil was stabilized with the optimum
    BA-CTCP combination (9% BA + 20% CTCP). The MLR prediction model was less efficient
    and accurate than the ANN model.&lt;/p&gt;'
