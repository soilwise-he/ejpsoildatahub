  title: Effect of Five Organic Soil Amendments on Meloidogyne Incognita Infecting
    Tomato Plants under Greenhouse Conditions
  abstract: "A pot experiment was conducted in order to study the impact of time application\
    \ of four animal manures i.e. chicken, horse, farm-yard and pigeon manures and\
    \ town refuse added separately either pre or post planting treatments comparing\
    \ to oxamyl on tomato plant cv. Castle Rock infected with M. incognita under greenhouse\
    \ conditions (25\xB13oC). Results revealed that all tested materials clearly enhanced\
    \ plant growth characters to great degree and reduce gall and eggmass numbers.\
    \ Plant receiving pigeon manure as pre-planting or post planting applications\
    \ at the level of 5g/plant obviously surpassed other tested animal manures and\
    \ town refuse in the increment values of plant length (85.7 and 71.4%), total\
    \ plant fresh weight (66.4 and 37.9%) number of flowers (100 and 100%), fruits\
    \ (300 and 400%), and branches/plant(100 and 300%) and shoot dry weight (42.9\
    \ and 38.1%), as well as achieved the highest reduction percentage for number\
    \ of root galls(89.1 and 81.5 %), eggmasses (90 and 84.2%), for pre or post planting\
    \ applications, respectively followed by farm-yard manure where as chicken treatment\
    \ as a pre-planting soil amendments exhibited the lesser values in this respect.\
    \ All treatments obviously gave sizeable percentage increase values of nitrogen\
    \ (N), phosphorus(P), potassium(K), organic matter(O.M), and organic carbon(O.C)\
    \ in leaves of tomato plant. The pigeon or chicken manures showed also very narrow\
    \ C/N ratio (12.6:1) or (14.3:1), respectively, in this work. Among the tested\
    \ materials, pigeon manure ranked first in percentage increase values of chemical\
    \ components of leaves as pre-planting application, whereas chicken manure showed\
    \ this position as post-planting treatment.Read Complete Article at ijSciences:\
