  title: Influence Of Environment-Friendly Organic Wastes On The Properties Of Sandy
    Soil Under Growing Zea Mays L. In Arid Regions
  abstract: Environment-friendly organic wastes of Brewers' spent grain, a byproduct
    of the brewing process, have recently used as soil amendment to improve soil fertility
    and plant production. In this work, treatments of 1% (T1) and 2% (T2) of spent
    grains, 1% (C1) and 2% (C2) of compost and mix of both sources (C1T1) were used
    and compared to the control for growing <em>Zea mays </em>L. on sandy soil under
    arid Mediterranean climate. Soils were previously incubated at 65% saturation
    capacity for a month. The most relevant soil physical and chemical parameters
    were analysed. Water holding capacity and soil organic matter (OM) increased significantly
    along the treatments with the highest values in T2. Soil pH decreased along the
    treatments and the lowest pH was in C1T1. Bicarbonate decreased by 69% in C1T1
    comparing to control. Total nitrogen (TN) and available P varied significantly
    among all treatments and T2, C1T1 and C2 treatments increased 25, 17 and 11 folds
    in TN and 1.2, 0.6 and 0.3 folds in P, respectively related to control. Available
    K showed the highest values in C1T1. Soil micronutrients increased significantly
    along all treatments with the highest values in T2. After corn germination, significant
    variation was observed in the velocity of germination coefficients (VGC) among
    all treatments in the order of C1T1&gt;T2&gt;T1&gt;C2&gt;C1&gt;control. The highest
    records of final germination and germination index were in C1T1 and T2. The spent
    grains may compensate deficiencies of macro and micronutrients in newly reclaimed
    sandy soils without adverse effects to sustain crop production with a rider that
    excessive or continuous use need to be circumvented.
