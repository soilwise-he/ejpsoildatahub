  title: Delineating soil conditions in a nitrate vulnerable zone using field-scale
    electrical resistivity profiling mapping.
  abstract: Venice Tidal pond is an incredibly heterogeneous climate molded by regular
    changes and anthropogenic tensions. The region is an especially weak framework
    portrayed by high spatial geomorphologic inconstancy. In the site specific crop
    the board, characterized as the best methodologies to oversee heterogeneous farmlands,
    can possibly amplify rural creation while protecting soil and water assets. This
    work was pointed toward recognizing and portraying spatial changeability inside
    the fields regarding soil fruitfulness and useful potential utilizing accuracy
    agribusiness standards. Programmed Resistivity Profiling (ARP) was carried out
    to concentrate on spatial inconstancy of the field and to characterize the best
    restriction of twenty soil inspecting focuses. Three years' verifiable yield maps
    were utilized to decide homogeneous zones inside the review region. The utilization
    of a fluffy c-implies bunching calculation prompted order of four homogeneous
    zones, which were relegated with useful possibilities utilizing an ANOVA trial
    of soil highlights and verifiable yield information. Such order was approved by
    an examination of the homogeneous zone's useful potential with five-year normal
    creation.
