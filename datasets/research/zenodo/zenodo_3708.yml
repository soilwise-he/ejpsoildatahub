  title: Mulch Inoculation and Placement Influenced Barley (Hordeum Vulgare) Growth
    and Soil Nitrate Levels
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;We investigated the effect of point of mulch placement and use
    of leaf mulches from plants inoculated with rhizobia on growth, nitrogen concentration
    and content of barley, and soil nitrate and pH changes. Mulches placed on soil
    surface enhanced barley heights and vegetative biomass in all leaf types used.&nbsp;
    However, nitrogen concentration was relatively higher in both barley vegetative
    plants and ears of barley grown in mixed mulches of both inoculated and uninoculated
    leaves. Mixing mulch types with soil caused a quick nitrate release within the
    first four weeks, which sharply dropped before week 6. Placing mulches on the
    soil surface resulted to a gradual nitrate release over the study period. Further,
    soil pH in all mulch treatments decreased within the first four weeks. Results
    from this study indicated that point of mulch placement was more effective than
    rhizobia inoculation of mulch on barley growth, nitrogen concentration and content,
    soil nitrate and pH changes. The results for nitrate levels revealed that it might
    be necessary for farmers to understand nitrogen requirements of crop so as to
    know where to place mulches. Results on pH revealed that care should be taken
    when mulching crops that are sensitive to small changes in pH.&lt;/p&gt;'
