  title: Nutrient use Efficiency of different Organic Fertilizer and its Effect on
    Soil Properties and Yield of Brassica Alboglabra
  abstract: "Abstract\u2014 In organic farming, homemade organic fertilizer such as\
    \ compost or enriched organic material had become one of crucial factors for nutrient\
    \ management. Other than the limited source of N for organic fertilizer as the\
    \ key factor for growth-limiting nutrients in organic farming, the cost of fertilization\
    \ is also affected by different organic fertilizer application rates. Therefore,\
    \ the objectives of this study were (i) to determine the effect of these organic\
    \ fertilizers on the soil properties (chemical and biological properties) and\
    \ (ii) to evaluate the efficiency and growth performance of Kailan (Brassica alboglabra)\
    \ as influence by the application of different organic fertilizer in the field.\
    \ A study was conducted at an integrated organic farming research area in the\
    \ Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) at Serdang,\
    \ Selangor for two consecutive cycles. The experimental treatments were focused\
    \ on the different rates of organic fertilizer inputs (3-33 t/ha from organic\
    \ sources) with soil alone as a control. The treatments were applied 14 days after\
    \ transplanting using Brassica alboglabgra as a test crop. The study result found\
    \ that a BIOC at 2 tonne kg/ha give significant different in nutrient use efficiency\
    \ (NUE), however NC at 33 tonne kg/ha rate of organic input had improved most\
    \ of soil properties NF showed a great yield as well as their growth performances.\
    \ Study findings have shown that the range of application rate of organic input\
    \ depends on applicability of the organic fertilizer whether it can promotes nutrient\
    \ uptake in plants and or can be scaled up to farm level to sustain organic system\
    \ productivity."
