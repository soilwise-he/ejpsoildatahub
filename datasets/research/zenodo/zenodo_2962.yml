  title: 'Investigation on the performance of ''Fino'' materials to stabilize expansive
    soil: A case study in Yeka Sub-City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia'
  abstract: Expansive soil swells when it is wet, and it will shrink when it dries.
    Due to this behavior of the soil, the strength and other properties of soil are
    inferior. To improve its properties, it is necessary to stabilize the soil with
    different stabilizers. Soil stabilization is a process to treat the soil to maintain,
    alter, or improve expansive soil performance. In this study, the potential of
    'Fino' as stabilizing additive to expansive soil was investigated for the improving
    engineering properties of expansive soil to be used as subgrade material. The
    evaluation involved the determination of the Free Swell test, CBR test, Atterberg's
    limits, and the Proctor test of expansive soil in its natural state as well as
    when mixed with varying proportions of 'Fino.' The practices were performed on
    six proportions 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30 % with expansive soil. The research
    result indicated a considerable reduction in Swelling, and the Maximum dry Density
    of soil was improved. Optimum moisture content decreased in increasing 'Fino.'
    At 30% of 'Fino,' the CBR values of expansive soil increased from 1.06% to 5.94%,
    Liquid Limit decreased from 95.2% to 29.4%, plasticity index decreased from 57.24%
    to 17.82% and the degree of expansion of the natural subgrade soil has reduced
    from "very high to medium." Hence, it is concluded that the 'Fino' at 30% has
    shown significant improvement in the expansive soil's engineering properties meeting
    the ERA and AASHTO Standard specifications requirements for road subgrade material.
