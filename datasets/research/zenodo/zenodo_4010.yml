  title: Effect of under Sowing Date of Melon under Sown to Maize and its Influence
    on Soil Properties
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study examined the under sowing date of melon under sown
    to maize and its influence on soil properties. The field trial was carried out
    at the Faculty of Agriculture Teaching and Research Farm, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu
    Ojukwu University, Igbariam Campus. The experiment was laid out in a randomized
    complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Data collected was subjected
    to T-test analysis and mean separation was done using LSD at 5% alpha level. The
    findings of the study showed that the tested parameters; plant height, leaf area,
    maize grain yield and soil properties assessed increased in mixed crop than the
    sole crop. The results suggest that under sowing melon under sown to maize at
    2 weeks after maize establishment is an efficient and effective production system.
    Both the maize and studied soil benefited from the melon. The study clearly indicated
    that melon can be under sown to maize to maximize land use and higher productivity
    per unit land area.&lt;/p&gt;'
