  title: Assessment of Permeability Characteristics of Ado-Ekiti to Ikere-Ekiti Road
    Soil, Southwestern Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;There is need for good knowledge of soil permeability in order
    to estimate the quantity of fluid or water flow in soil, which will help in building
    and maintaining good road. The study sought to assess the permeability characteristics
    of Ado Ekiti to Ikere Ekiti road soil. Soil samples were taken from ten locations,
    subjected to permeability tests in Laboratory and the results analysed. Results
    showed that that the permeability values obtained from grain size and falling
    head methods varied from 1.73 x 10 6&nbsp; to 2.15 x 10 3 mm s and 8.46 x 10 2&nbsp;
    to 1.23 x 10 1 cm s respectively for all the soil samples. These showed that some
    soil samples have high permeability, while others have low permeability. Though
    all the soil samples were well graded. Thus, soil with high permeability portrayed
    high contents of granular materials sand , while that of low permeability portrayed
    high contents of clay and its minerals. There is need for further study. Adeyemi
