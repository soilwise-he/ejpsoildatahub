  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physically-based watershed-scale
    model, holds promise as a&lt;br&gt;

    means to predict tributary sediment and nutrient loads to the Laurentian Great
    Lakes. In the present study,&lt;br&gt;

    model performance is compared across six watersheds draining into Lake Erie to
    determine the applicability&lt;br&gt;

    of SWAT to watersheds of differing characteristics. After initial model parameterization,
    the Huron, Raisin,&lt;br&gt;

    Maumee, Sandusky, Cuyahoga, and Grand SWAT models were calibrated (1998&ndash;2001)
    and confirmed, or&lt;br&gt;

    validated (2002&ndash;2005), individually for stream water discharge, sediment
    loads, and nutrient loads (total P,&lt;br&gt;

    soluble reactive P, total N, and nitrate) based on available datasets. SWAT effectively
    predicted hydrology and&lt;br&gt;

    sediments across a range of watershed characteristics. SWAT estimation of nutrient
    loads was weaker&lt;br&gt;

    although still satisfactory at least two-thirds of the time across all nutrient
    parameters and watersheds. SWAT&lt;br&gt;

    model performance was most satisfactory in agricultural and forested watersheds,
    and was less so in&lt;br&gt;

    urbanized settings. Model performance was influenced by the availability of observational
    data with high&lt;br&gt;

    sampling frequency and long duration for calibration and confirmation evaluation.
    In some instances, it&lt;br&gt;

    appeared that parameter adjustments that improved calibration of hydrology negatively
    affected subsequent&lt;br&gt;

    sediment and nutrient calibration, suggesting trade-offs in calibrating for hydrologic
    vs. water quality model&lt;br&gt;

    performance. Despite these considerations, SWAT accurately predicted average stream
    discharge, sediment&lt;br&gt;

    loads, and nutrient loads for the Raisin, Maumee, Sandusky, and Grand watersheds
    such that future use of&lt;br&gt;

    these SWAT models for various scenario testing is reasonable and warranted.&lt;/p&gt;'
