  title: Changes of Soil Fertility Status in Some Soil Series of Tista Floodplain
    Soils of Bangladesh, during 1996-2016
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The study of several soil series of Tista Floodplain soils were\
    \ carried out to find the changing trend of nutrients status from 1996 to 2016.\
    \ The studied values of different soil quality variables were changed likewise\
    \ pH 5.87 \xB1 0.47 to 5.95 \xB1 0.33, organic matter 1.37 \xB1 0.31% to 1.47\
    \ \xB1 0.41%, ,total nitrogen 0.49 \xB1 0.13 cmol/kg to 0.64 \xB1 0.07 cmol/kg\
    \ , phosphorous 0.10 \xB1 0.04 cmol/kg to 3.19 \xB1 0.34 cmol/kg, potassium 0.31\
    \ \xB1 0.29 cmol/kg to 2.93 \xB1 0.26 cmol/kg, sulfur 0.19 \xB1 0.05 cmol/kg to\
    \ 8.66 \xB1 2.74 cmol/kg, iron 1.09 \xB1 0.46 cmol/kg to 2.07 \xB1 0.99 cmol/kg,\
    \ manganese 0.10 \xB1 0.02 cmol/kg to 0.31 \xB1 0.30 cmol/kg, copper 0.03\xB1\
    \ 0.01 cmol/kg to 0.02 \xB1 0.01 cmol/kg, zinc 0.01 \xB1 4.8E-20 cmol/kg to 0.01\
    \ \xB1 0.01 cmol/kg in 1996 and 2016 respectively. Almost all variables changed\
    \ over significantly at 5% (P &lt; 0.05) level except pH, organic matter, total\
    \ Nitrogen and Copper content whose were not significant at 5% (P &lt; 0.05) level\
    \ not even 10% (P &lt; 0.10) level. The increasing trends of total Nitrogen, Phosphorous,\
    \ and Iron were positively correlated from 1996 to 2016 than other variables.\
    \ The copper and zinc content did not showing any effective change over these\
    \ 20 years. The overall nutrients were adequate except organic matter and total\
    \ nitrogen content. But, the trends had positive direction of all nutrients due\
    \ to application of organic and inorganic fertilizer that might be correlated\
    \ with increasing concern about nutrients management concept among the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;"
