  title: Carcinogenicity of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in transformer soil
    in vicinity of University of Port Harcourt, Choba, Nigeria
  abstract: "Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in soils within the vicinity of transformers\
    \ in the main campus of university of Port Harcourt, Choba was monitored. Evaluation\
    \ was done for both total PCBs (Aroclor) and congener\u2019s form using Gas Chromatography\
    \ at four designated sites; A, B, C, and D with geographical co-ordinates for\
    \ site A-Donald Ekong Library, latitude 4<sup>o</sup>54\u2019, 32\u2019\u2019\
    N and longitude 6<sup>o</sup>55:05\u2019\u2019E, site B-Senate building with latitude\
    \ 4<sup>o</sup>54\u201914\u2019\u2019N and longitude 6<sup>o</sup>55\u2019, 23\u2019\
    \u2019N, site C-Transformer close to music department with latitude 4<sup>o</sup>54\u2019\
    , 01\u2019\u2019N and longitude 6<sup>o</sup>55; 56\u2019\u2019E and finally site\
    \ D-Gana-Ma Lecturers residential quarters with latitude 4<sup>o</sup>54\u2019\
    .23\u2019\u2019 N and longitude 6<sup>o</sup>55\u2019, 74\u2019\u2019E. All the\
    \ sites are polluted with PCBs that exceeds the maximum limit of 2.0 ppm as per\
    \ United States Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The order of total PCBs was\
    \ site D site &gt; site A &gt; site B &gt; site C, which also corresponds with\
    \ the order of sites carcinogenicity of dioxin-like PCBs, calculated as Total\
    \ toxicity Equivalence concentration (TTEC). The TTEC for site A, B, C and D corresponds\
    \ to 0.000012, 0.000035, 0.0000185 and 0.00039 (mg/kg), respectively, which exceeded\
    \ the method B clean up levels for 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin levels\
    \ of 1.3\xD710<sup>-5 </sup>mg/kg and need of massive cleanup for carcinogenic\
    \ dioxin-like PCBs. We also found out there is high loadings of PCBs congeners\
    \ with little or no biodegradability across the four sites. To mitigate the known\
    \ human health risks posed by PCBs toxicity, non-PCBs transformers should be replaced\
    \ with current ones and extensive soil remediation is needed to clean up the PCBs\
    \ to avoid negative impact."
