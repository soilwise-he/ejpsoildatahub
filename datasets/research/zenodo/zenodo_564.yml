  title: Impact of Biofield Energy Treatment on Soil Fertility
  abstract:
  - "&lt;p&gt;Measurement of soil components such as microbial population, minerals\
    \ and obviously the content of organic carbon play the important roles for the\
    \ productivity of crops and plants. The present study was attempted to evaluate\
    \ the impact of Mr. Trivedi&rsquo;s biofield energy treatment on soil for its\
    \ physical (electrical conductivity), chemical (minerals) and microbial flora\
    \ (bacteria and fungi). A plot of lands was assigned for this study with some\
    \ already grown plants. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered\
    \ as control, while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi&rsquo;s biofield\
    \ energy treatment without physically touching and referred as treated. In the\
    \ treated soil the total bacterial and fungal counts were increased by 546 and\
    \ 617%, respectively as compared to the untreated soil. Additionally, the conductivity\
    \ of soil of the treated plot was increased by 79% as compared to the soil of\
    \ control plot. Apart from microbes, the content of various minerals were also\
    \ changed in the biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content showed\
    \ 2909 ppm in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to 3943\
    \ ppm i.e. 36% increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium\
    \ were increased by 12% and 7%, respectively as compared to the control. Besides,\
    \ the level of some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased\
    \ by 9%, 23%, and 41%, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical\
    \ constituents of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8% in\
    \ the treated soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged\
    \ that the biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement\
    \ in the physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component. Thus,\
    \ improved the conductance, supportive microbes, minerals and overall productivity\
    \ of crops. In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative\
    \ way to increase the yield of quality crops by increasing soil fertility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\
