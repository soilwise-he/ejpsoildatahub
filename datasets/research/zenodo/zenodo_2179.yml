  title: The effect of biochar application on soil properties and growth of the model
    plant Zea mays
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The classic way of land cultivation means the use of inorganic
    fertilizers that are salts that dissolve rapidly in a short time and improve soil
    fertility. This process negatively affects soil salinity and the life of microorganisms.
    The use of biochar as a soil conditioner is a promising solution. The aim of the
    work is to enrich the properties of less fertile soils and to enhance the growth
    of the model plant Zea mays (corn) by biochar application. We used four different
    soil types commonly spread in the Czech Republic &ndash; regosol, chernozem, cambisol
    and fluvisol representing a broad range of organic matter content. Also, we applied
    two different EBC (The European Biochar Certificate) certified biochars for use
    in agriculture. Corn seeds were germinated and cultivated for 3 months in repeated
    plant life cycles. Soils and biochar samples were characterized before and after
    cultivation by TGA, EA, BET, SEM, extraction of organic matter. The effect of
    biochar application was observed continuously through the measurement of plant
    height, the number of leaves and cobs. After the finalization of cultivation experiments,
    the dry mass of individual plants was measured, and root image analysis of every
    plant was performed. Fluvisol and cambisol have much higher organic matter content
    than regosol and chernozem. The application of biochar had the most significant
    impact on regosol regardless of the application dose; these results are in good
    agreement with the root image analysis. Furthermore, plants in soils treated with
    biochar had more corn cobs. The analysis on biochar samples showed the continual
    leaching of both organic and inorganic molecules from biochar to surrounding soil,
    which is crucial for its possible use as a soil conditioner and confirms the long-timescale
    positive effect on soil properties.&lt;/p&gt;'
