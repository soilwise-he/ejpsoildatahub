  title: Systems knowledge for sustainable soil and land management
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;While soils and land are pivotal elements of many Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) and societal challenges, they&lt;br&gt;

    face degradation and reduction of related functions and services worldwide. Societal
    demands on soils and land are&lt;br&gt;

    increasing, including contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation,
    ecosystem services, biodiversity&lt;br&gt;

    and biomass production for food, feed, fiber and energy. This adverse combination
    of reducing capacities and increasing&lt;br&gt;

    demands requires rapid transition towards sustainable soil and land management
    that mitigates trade-offs and creates&lt;br&gt;

    synergies. Likewise, a transformation of soil and land research is required to
    scientifically support the sustainable&lt;br&gt;

    transformation.&lt;br&gt;

    Based on a literature analysis combined with engagement of soil and land scientists,
    we developed a systemic research&lt;br&gt;

    framework for sustainable soil and land management to support the implementation
    of the Horizon Europe Mission &ldquo;A&lt;br&gt;

    Soil Deal for Europe&rdquo;. The framework summarizes soil and land related topics
    into six societal challenges and associates&lt;br&gt;

    them with eight knowledge types that outline integrated research for development
    and implementation of sustainable&lt;br&gt;

    soil and land management. We propose that research should be aligned with living
    labs and lighthouses to leverage&lt;br&gt;

    local solutions, innovation, training and education. We outline the role of experimentation,
    data analysis, assessment,&lt;br&gt;

    modelling and the importance of research for institutions, governance and policy
    support. For encouraging a swift transition&lt;br&gt;

    towards a systems approach for sustainable soil and land management, we concluded
    that among all knowledge&lt;br&gt;

    types, those addressing socio-economic interrelations with soil health and related
    policies currently represent the biggest&lt;br&gt;

    bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;'
