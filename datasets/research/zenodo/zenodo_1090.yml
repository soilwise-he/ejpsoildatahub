  title: THE EFFECT OF SOIL ENVIRONMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRAPE CUTTINGS
  abstract: 'A pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of potting media
    on sprouting and seedling growth of grape cuttings. Three grape varieties viz.
    Red globe, Thomson seedless and Crimson seedless were planted in four different
    growth media: CS-Canal silt, CSFYM-Canal silt (75%) + FYM (25%), CSB-Canal silt
    (25%) + Bagasse (75%) and CSBCPCanal silt (25%) + Bagasse (50%) + Coco peat (25%).
    The experiment was conducted in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) along with
    three replications.'
