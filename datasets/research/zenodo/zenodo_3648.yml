  title: SOIL FERTILITY STATUS OF FIVE MAJOR MULBERRY CULTIVATED DISTRICTS IN TAMIL
    NADU
  abstract: The available nutrient status of surface layer (0-30 cm) soils of mulberry
    gardens of Erode, Krishnagiri, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Salem districts of Tamil
    Nadu were evaluated. Samples were collected and analyzed for 12 chemical properties.
    Of the 1250 soil samples tested, 100 % fell under the alkaline pH category (&gt;8.2)
    and normal in Electical Conductivity (0.125 - 0.273mmhos/cm). Organic carbon content
    was low in 80 % of the soils (&lt;0.5 %) and 20 % fell under a high range (&gt;1.0
    %). 80% and 20% of the samples were found moderately high (270-550 kg/ha) and
    high (&gt;550 kg/ha) in available nitrogen. Available phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)
    were low (&lt;22 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>/ ha.) in 40 % and medium (22-55
    kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>/ha.) in 60 % of the samples. Similarly, available
    potassium (K<sub>2</sub>O) content was moderately high in 60 % (240-300 kg K<sub>2</sub>O/ha.)
    and high in 40 % (&gt; 300 kg K<sub>2</sub>O/ha) of the samples. Available sulphur
    were low (&lt; 10ppm) in 20 % and medium (&gt;15 ppm) in 80 % of the samples.
    While DTPA extractable micronutrients were found in low to sufficient category
    such as Mn low in 40% (&lt;4ppm) and sufficient in 60% (&gt;4ppm) of the soil
    samples, B found low in 80% (&lt;0.5ppm) and sufficient in 20% (&gt; 0.5-1.0ppm)
    of the samples. 60% and 40% of the samples found as sufficient (&gt; 2.5 ppm)
    to low in Fe (&lt; 2.5 ppm). 100 % of the soil samples deficient (&lt; 2.0 ppm)
    and sufficient (&gt; 0.2 ppm) in available Zn and Cu content in five major mulberry
    cultivated districts of Tamil Nadu. Hence, maintenance of optimum level of organic
    carbon content in the soil through application of optimum quantities of organic
    manures is recommended. Use of S containing fertilizers and FYM, green manuring
    is suggested to reduce the pH.
