  title: Unique Raoultella species isolated from petroleum contaminated soil degrades
    polystyrene and polyethylene
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Polyolefin plastics, such as polyethylene (PE) and&nbsp;&lt;a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polystyrene"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(PS),
    are the most widely used synthetic plastics in our daily life. However, the chemical
    structure of polyolefin plastics is composed of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, which
    is extremely stable and makes polyolefin plastics recalcitrant to degradation.
    The growing accumulation of plastic waste has caused serious&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/environmental-pollution"&gt;environmental
    pollution&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and has become a global environmental concern. In this
    study, we isolated a unique&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Raoultella&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;sp. DY2415
    strain from petroleum-contaminated soil that can degrade PE and PS film. After
    60 d of incubation with strain DY2415, the weight of the UV-irradiated PE (UVPE)
    film and PS film decreased by 8% and 2%, respectively. Apparent microbial colonization
    and holes on the surface of the films were observed by scanning electron microscopy
    (SEM). Furthermore, the Fourier transform&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/infrared-spectrometer"&gt;infrared
    spectrometer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(FTIR) results showed that new oxygen-containing functional
    groups such as -OH and -CO were introduced into the polyolefin molecular structure.
    Potential enzymes that may be involved in the biodegradation of polyolefin plastics
    were analyzed. These results demonstrate that&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Raoultella&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;sp.
    DY2415 has the ability to degrade polyolefin plastics and provide a basis for
    further investigating the biodegradation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;'
