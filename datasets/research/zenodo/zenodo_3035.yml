  title: INFLUENCE OF NATURAL AND CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE RYAZAN REGION ON THE
    STRENGTH AND DEFORMATION PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL OF THE ROADBED
  abstract: The article deals with factors affecting the coating, such as force effects,
    physical and mechanical characteristics, climatic conditions. It is known that
    the subgrade soil changes its strength and deformation characteristics at different
    humidity. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account changes in the state
    of the soil base under conditions of seasonal fluctuations in temperature and
    humidity. It is determined that climatic factors have a significant impact on
    the stress-strain state of non-rigid pavements, and the strength of soils in the
    foundations of pavements changes throughout the year depending on changes in their
    humidity, which, in turn, is related to temperature. During thaw periods, moisture
    accumulates intensively under the coating, which leads to a decrease in its resistance.
