  title: 'Assessing Agricultural Soil Variability in Mandal Taluka, Ahmedabad, Gujarat:
    Implications for Crop Suitability and Ecosystem Dynamics'
  abstract: Land degradation poses a significant threat to food security and socioeconomic
    well-being, exacerbated by various human activities such as construction, dumping,
    deep plowing, continuous agricultural land use, deforestation, changes in land
    use, alterations in land topography, deep soil modifications, regulation of soil
    water, excessive use of nutrition and fertilizers, and heavy reliance on pesticides
    and insecticides, resulting in nutrient depletion and loss of topsoil. There is
    an urgent need for a thorough reevaluation of soil conditions to enhance soil
    quality. This paper presents a study focused on the physicochemical parameters
    of soil in Mandal Taluka, Gujarat.
