  title: Study of Metal Contaminated Soil on Various part of Planet Earth
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Exposure to toxic heavy metals is associated with many chronic
    diseases and can cause a wide varietyof health problems. Urban soils receive varying
    inputs of heavy metals from a variety of mobile or stationarysources such as vehicular
    traffic, industrial plants, power generation facilities, residential oil burning,
    wasteincineration, construction, and demolition activities and re suspension of
    surrounding contaminated soils and makesa significant contribution to the pollution
    in the urban environment. Therefore, the study of urban soil is importantfor determining
    the origin, distribution, and level of heavy metal contamination in urban environments.
    Presentpaper deal with the review of the soil analysis and hazardous effects on
    human health. Shalini Arora | (Dr.) R. S. Lokhande | Dr. C. K. Jain &quot;Study
