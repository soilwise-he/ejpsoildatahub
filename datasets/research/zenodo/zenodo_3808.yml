  title: 'DETERMINATION OF THE URANIUM CONTENT IN SOME SOIL SAMPLES FROM AJAOKUTA,
    KOGI STATE: NIGERIA'
  abstract: "This work present the Uranium (238U) content in soil samples collected\
    \ in Ajaokuta from some villages was been determined. The measurement of the soil\
    \ Uranium activity concentration were made using a multi\u2013channel pulse height\
    \ analyzer (Camberra series 10 plus) coupled to a 76.2mm x 76.2mm NaI (TI) scintillation\
    \ detector. 2.93) The mean Uranium content in the analyzed samples was found to\
    \ be (44.26 Bq/kg which is higher than the world mean value of 35Bq/kg. The results\
    \ were in good agreement with others for soils from region which is considered\
    \ as normal or slightly high in radioactivity level."
