  title: "Sustainable Innovations: A Qualitative Study on Farmers\u2019 Perceptions\
    \ Driving the Diffusion of Beneficial Soil Microbes in Germany and the UK"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract. &lt;/strong&gt;Legislation and consumer
    preference for more sustainability in the food system require farmers to adopt
    more stringent sustainably measures without sacrificing business profitability.
    Scientific and technological innovations, such as beneficial soil microbes for
    in-field application, may help to achieve this goal, but adoption rates have remained
    slow thus far. The adopter&rsquo;s perspective is essential to understanding why.
    This research investigates factors that drive the perceptions of soil microbe
    solutions across three groups of (potential) adopters as an input to the design
    of effective communication strategies to accelerate technology diffusion. Factors
    included in the analyses are relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability,
    observability and image of applying soil microbes at the farm level. The analysis
    is based on 28 in-depth qualitative interviews in Germany and the UK, and a focus
    group discussion in the UK. Data were analysed via content analysis using deductive
    and inductive processes. Deductive codes were derived from the diffusion of innovations
    theory. Our results show that soil microbes are still perceived as a challenging
    product in all three adopter groups, despite the acknowledgement of several advantages
    and benefits. Predominantly, farmers evaluate the innovation as complex. Furthermore,
    the observability of the soil microbes was perceived as challenging, which also
    transfers to the trialability of the innovation. Despite this, in all adopter
    groups the need for the innovation was recognized.&lt;/p&gt;'
