  title: 'Experimental and Analytical Investigation of Wall Strengthened with Soil
    Nail Facing: An Approach to Enhance Soil Stability'
  abstract: "India is growing at a very fast rate in term of infrastructure development.\
    \ In the construction sector major work going on is such as construction of tunnels,\
    \ hydropower projects, construction of highways and underground metro projects.\
    \ Due to this excavation's, construction of retaining walls, ground improvements,\
    \ and stabilization of slopes comes into picture. In the present research work\
    \ the physical model was used for testing different flexible facing materials\
    \ and comparing the results with the conventional facing. The nails used in physical\
    \ testing were six in no. and arranged in the rectangular pattern.\_ Alongside\
    \ with physical testing the results were validated using Plaxis 3D. On\_ \_comparison\
    \ of results, it was found that the soil nails are able to take up the tensile\
    \ stresses to certain extent and are helpful in stabilizing the slope. In the\
    \ present study Four different facing material were compared i.e Conventional\
    \ Facing consisting of wire mesh and shotcrete, Aluminium Facing, Geonet Facing\
    \ GI Facing. As far as experimental results are concerned maximum stresses were\
    \ taken up by conventional facing. In the present research as the major focus\
    \ is on finding some alternative material to Conventional facing. Among the Flexible\
    \ materials Geonet has taken maximum stresses and about 61% of stresses taken\
    \ up by the conventional facing."
