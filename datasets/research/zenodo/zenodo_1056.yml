  title: Data mining of urban soil spectral library for estimating organic carbon
  abstract: "Accurate quantification of urban soil organic carbon (SOC) is essential\
    \ for understanding anthropogenic changes and further guiding effective city managements.\
    \ Visible and near infrared (vis\u2013NIR) spectroscopy can monitor the SOC content\
    \ in a time- and cost-effective manner. However, processes and mechanisms dominating\
    \ the relationships between SOC and spectral data in urban soils remain unknown.\
    \ The main objective of this paper was to evaluate whether multiple stratification\
    \ strategies (i.e., based on land-use/land-cover [LULC], pH, and spectral clustering)\
    \ resulted in better predicted performance for SOC compared to the non-stratified\
    \ (global) models. Results showed that regarding the non-stratified models, the\
    \ convolutional neural network (CNN) model exhibited the best performance (validation\
    \ R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.73), followed by Cubist (validation R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66)\
    \ and memorybased learning (validation R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65). After LULC stratification,\
    \ Cubist model achieved the best prediction (validation R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76),\
    \ improving the value of ratio of performance to interquartile distance by 0.11\
    \ compared to the global CNN model. Areas with high SOC values were mainly located\
    \ in the city center. Stratification by LULC class is a promising strategy for\
    \ addressing the impact of the soil-landscape diversity and complexity on vis\u2013\
    NIR spectral estimation of SOC in urban soil spectral library."
