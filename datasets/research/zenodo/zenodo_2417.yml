  title: Differential response of alpine grassland ecosystem multifunctionality to
    altitudinal gradients depends mainly on bacterial and soil characteristics
  abstract: Soil microbial communities are crucial in enabling ecosystem multifunctionality
    (EMF). However, the mechanisms by which biotic and abiotic factors regulate EMF
    in alpine grasslands, and the regulatory effects of soil microorganisms on ecosystem
    function under the background of altitude at large regional scales, remain unclear.
    We established a 1500-km sampling area along the altitude gradient in alpine grassland
    on the Tibetan Plateau. With increasing altitude, bacterial and fungal community
    diversity increased, and microbial network complexity and EMF showed unimodal
    variation patterns. Soil bacterial communities were more sensitive to environmental
    changes than fungal communities. Microbial network complexity was a better predictor
    of ecosystem functioning than the microbial community composition when both mono-
    and multifunctional drivers were considered, and annual mean temperature and soil
    organic carbon were the main environmental drivers. Our study demonstrates the
    importance of symbiotic networks as key components of microbial biomes for climate
    change buffering effects in alpine grasslands.
