  title: Seismic Performance of Concrete Reservoirs Considering Soil-Structure-Fluid
    Interaction under Near- and Far-Field Seismic Excitations
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of fluid reservoirs in recent earthquakes
    and locating of Iran in the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt and the frequent occurrence
    of destructive earthquakes, as well as the existence of various faults in our
    country, results in the safe design and analysis of these structures. Seismic
    excitations in the near range of the fault have different properties compared
    to the far fault seismic excitations, such as high-frequency content, long periodic
    pulses in speed-time history, etc. in the near-fault seismic excitations. Therefore,
    in the present study, the seismic performance of concrete reservoirs was evaluated
    by considering soil-structure-fluid interaction under near- and far-fault earthquakes.
    For this purpose, the finite element method was used for numerical simulation
    by Abacus software. The nonlinear behavior of the bed and the concrete were modeled
    with the behavioral models of Mohr-Coulomb and damaged plastic concrete, respectively.
    The Euler&ndash;Lagrange element was used to introduce the hydrodynamic pressure
    of the reservoir fluid and infinite element was used to prevent reflection of
    seismic waves and earthquake energy loss in the boundary around the bed. After
    analyzing the boundary distance sensitivity and dimensional analysis of the elements
    while validating the simulation of parametric studies, the present study was conducted
    for variables such as earthquake frequency contents, field earthquake, reservoir
    geometry, and different bed hardness and practical results were presented by comparing
    the results.&lt;/p&gt;'
