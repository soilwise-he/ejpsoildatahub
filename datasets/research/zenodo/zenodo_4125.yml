  title: Use Of Radial Basis Function Neural Network For Bearing Pressure Prediction
    Of Strip Footing On Reinforced Granular Bed Overlying Weak Soil
  abstract: Earth reinforcing techniques have become useful and economical to solve
    problems related to difficult grounds and provide satisfactory foundation performance.
    In this context, this paper uses radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)
    for predicting the bearing pressure of strip footing on reinforced granular bed
    overlying weak soil. The inputs for the neural network models included plate width,
    thickness of granular bed and number of layers of reinforcements, settlement ratio,
    water content, dry density, cohesion and angle of friction. The results indicated
    that RBFNN model exhibited more than 84 % prediction accuracy, thereby demonstrating
    its application in a geotechnical problem.
