  title: Soil Moisture Characteristics of Humid Tropical Soils of the Southern Part
    of Rivers State Nigeria
  abstract: 'Soil moisture characteristics data are extremely valuable tools for describing
    and managing water storage and flow transport in soils, as well as informing climate-smart
    agricultural courses and practices. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), aggregate
    size distribution, mean weight diameter (MWD), soil moisture characteristic curve
    (SMCC) and other indices of soil structure were estimated for soils of the 8 Local
    Government Areas (Akuku-Toru, Degema, Gokhana, Khana, Ogu-Bolo, Okrika, Oyigbo
    and Tai) in the South of Rivers State Nigeria. Core samples were taken from across
    the 8 LGAs in triplicates at 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20cm depths along with bulk
    samples at 0- 10cm and 10-20cm depths. The high spatial variability of these soils
    of the same terrain, were evidenced in the high coefficient of variation (CV)
    values in all parameters measured; with the exception of % of sand across all
    areas sampled. The soils were generally sandy loam to sand. Bulk density values
    ranged between 1.17 to 1.74gcm-3 at the 0-10cm depth, with a CV of 12.8% across
    locations. Ks values were generally moderate (2.5x10-3 to 9.9 x 10-4 cmsec-1 )
    with a CV of 91.8 to 109.7% across locations and depth. Degema, Okrika and Tai
    soils had significantly higher aggregate stability as indicated by the MWD, with
    43.5 to 46.1% of their aggregates being >3.5mm in diameter size; when compared
    with the other locations. SMCC showed that moisture content at the field capacity
    (50cm suction) varied significantly across both locations and depths, with CV
    values between 49.0 to 71.0%. At the 0.1bar suction, the volumetric moisture contents
    were in the order 0.030, 0.020, 0.020, 0.020, 0.012, 0.010, 0.010 and 0.002cm3
    cm-3 for Gokhana, Degema, Oyigbo, Khana, Ogu-Bolo, Akuku-Toru, Tai and Okrika
    soils, respectively. Results obtained form a baseline data of the parameters measured,
    for management of water storage, climate smart and precision agriculture; in these
    parts of Rivers State.
