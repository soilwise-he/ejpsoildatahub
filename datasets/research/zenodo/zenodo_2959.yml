  title: Non-Toxic Increases in Nitrogen Availability Can Improve the Ability of the
    Soil Lichen Cladonia rangiferina to Cope with Environmental Changes
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Climate change and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on drylands\
    \ are greatly threatening these especially vulnerable areas. Soil biocrust-forming\
    \ lichens in drylands can provide early indicators of these disturbances and play\
    \ a pivotal role, as they contribute to key ecosystem services. In this study,\
    \ we explored the effects of different long-term water availability regimes simulating\
    \ climate changes and their interaction with N addition on the physiological response\
    \ of the soil lichen Cladonia rangiferina. Three sets of this lichen were subjected\
    \ to control, reduced watering, and reduced watering and N addition (40 kg NH4NO3\
    \ ha\u22121 year\u22121 ) treatments for 16 months. Finally, all samples were\
    \ subjected to daily hydration cycles with N-enriched water at two levels (40\
    \ and 80 kg NH4NO3 ha\u22121 year\u22121 ) for 23 days. We found that reduced\
    \ watering significantly decreased the vitality of this lichen, whereas N addition\
    \ unexpectedly helped lichens subjected to reduced watering to cope with stress\
    \ produced by high temperatures. We also found that long-term exposure to N addition\
    \ contributed to the acclimation to higher N availability. Overall, our data suggest\
    \ that the interactions between reduced watering and increased N supply and temperature\
    \ have an important potential to reduce the physiological performance of this\
    \ soil lichen.&lt;/p&gt;"
