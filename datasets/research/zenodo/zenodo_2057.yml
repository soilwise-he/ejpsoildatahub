  title: The Use of Stone Columns to Reduce the Settlement of Swelling Soil Using
    Numerical Modeling
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The existing soils in the nature that is used for construction cannot
    necessarily bear the loadings on the structure. For example, in granular soils,
    the natural soil may be very loose and show a lot of elastic settlement. Sometimes,
    there are soft layers, saturated clay and swelling soils at the lower depths,
    which may cause significant settlement in the structure in terms of foundation
    load and clay layer thickness. To avoid such settlements, it is necessary to use
    certain techniques to improve the soil condition. One of the methods that have
    recently been widely used to reduce the settlement of soft soils and swelling
    soils is stone columns or single piles. In this research, first of all, the parameters
    in need for the analysis will be gained by using the experimental data, and then,
    the static and dynamic behavior of the confined stone columns is examined with
    geotextile and without geotextile by a group and single manner as in two-dimensional
    form using Plaxis numerical method of the finite element and the impact of the
    following parameters will be investigated in both static and dynamic modes: Column
    length, column diameter, single and group behavior of columns, and soil cohesion
    effect on the behavior of the confined stone column in geotextile and reduction
    of soil settlement during use of stone columns. The results of this research indicate
    correct understanding of the use of geotextile (Woven Geotextile with a specific
    elastic normal strength) to prevent the camber and the settlement of the column
    and increase of the strength and bearing capacity of the column.&lt;/p&gt;'
