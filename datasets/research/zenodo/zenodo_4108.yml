  title: In situ Impact of the Antagonistic Fungal Strain, Trichoderma gamsii T30
    on the Plant Pathogenic Fungus, Rhizoctonia solani in Soil
  abstract: "AbstractRhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne fungus causing a wide range\
    \ of plants diseases. Trichoderma gamsii strain T30 has previously been reported\
    \ as antagonistic against R. solani. Although there are a few studies about the\
    \ influence of Trichoderma strains on the R. solani density in a pathosystem in\
    \ the presence of plant hosts, this report for the first time comprehensively\
    \ describes in situ effects of a T. gamsii strain on the population density of\
    \ R. solani in the soil microcosmic conditions. The population dynamics of R.\
    \ solani were followed in the autoclaved and non-autoclaved soils in artificially\
    \ prepared microcosms up to day 25 after co-inoculation with T. gamsii in the\
    \ variable ratios (R1/T1; R1/T0.1; R1/T0.01 of R. solani/T. gamsii). The population\
    \ density of R. solani was evaluated by qPCR. In the autoclaved soil, target DNA\
    \ copies of R. solani increased in the control samples from 1 \xD7 105 to 6.5\
    \ \xD7 106. At R1/T0.01, the number of target DNA copies were not significantly\
    \ changed until day 11; however, it decreased by around five times at day 25.\
    \ At R1/T0.1 and R1/T1, the number of DNA copies was reduced to 2.1 \xD7 106 and\
    \ 7.6 \xD7 105 at day 11, respectively and the reduction was as much as 17 times\
    \ at day 25. In the non-autoclaved soil, the number of the fungal cells decreased\
    \ at day 25 whether inoculated or not with Trichoderma indicating a general suppression\
    \ by the soil microbiome. In brief, T. gamsii significantly inhibited the growth\
    \ of R. solani in the soil in situ and there was a general suppressive effect\
    \ of the natural microbiome."
