  title: Reproduction management of soil fertility for innovative approach in agromelioration
    of Ukraine
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The object of research is managing reproduction of
    soil fertility using innovations in the field of&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;agromelioration.
    One of the most problematic places is actualization the role and impact of innovations
    in agromelioration to ensure their effective management for the reproduction of
    soil fertility, increase land productivity and the sustainability of their use.
    Issues that raise in research are essential for the agricultural economy, but
    not always achieve goals for this reason, including natural and climatic factors.
    The set of such causes is not always possible to predict and to consider it especially
    at macro level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the course of the study, the modeling approaches of the
    economic processes in land&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;agromelioration on the basis
    of widespread use of random numbers (Monte Carlo), according to the received series
    production studies of changes in crop yields by crop rotation. Separately were
    used methods the Economic and Statistical &ndash; with the determination of the
    processes of validization and evaluation of the obtained results, Balance &ndash;
    when calculating the indicators of aggregated states, Planned and Calculated according
    to the development of targets and measurement of economic and ecological effects,
    etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results of the studies allow general condition of land
    resources in which there is a need for agromelioration measures due to disturbance
    of the soil environment and deviation of the pH value from the permissible level.
    It&rsquo;s noted that in Ukraine due to the existing unbalanced land use there
    is a further acidification of soils, at the same time there are significant areas
    of land that need desalination and/or desalinization. We carried out an in-depth
    analysis and substantiation of the transition to innovations in land agromelioration
    technologies, which are not inferior to the best world standards and are modern
    resource-saving due to the use of land agromelioration. The ecological and economic
    efficiency of the use of calcium-iron sludge (CIS) in relation to the desalination
    action in comparison with other agromelioration measures is revealed. We proposed
    to improve scientific and methodological approaches to estimation the effectiveness
    of management the reproduction of soil fertility by randomness (uncertainty) conditions
    the based on production approbation, using a variety of agromeliorative techniques
    (variances).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
