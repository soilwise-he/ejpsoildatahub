  title: "An isotope study on nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency and movement\
    \ in soil in a mimicked vermicompost\u2010based organo\u2010mineral fertilizer"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Vermicompost (VC), a stabilized organic material with high organic
    and humic carbon, and favorable aggregation properties, was tested as a fraction
    of organo-mineral&nbsp;fertilizers (OMFs), where organic and mineral fractions
    interact in hotspot areas with&nbsp;surrounding soil. Solutions containing 33P
    radioisotope and 15N-labeled mineral fertilizers were combined with VC at two
    ratios of organic carbon (Corg) to mineral&lt;br&gt;nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
    (P) (OMF7.5C and OMF15C) to simulate OMF granules. Control treatments included
    unfertilized soil (N0P0), mineral fertilizer (MFNP),&nbsp;and sole VC at two rates
    (OF7.5C and OF15C). Nitrogen and P uptake by Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum)
    were measured over in 8 weeks. Furthermore, MFNP,&nbsp;OMF7.5C, and OMF15C treatments
    were incubated for 10 days without plant to measure atom% 15N excess and 33P radioactivity,
    as indicators of N and P movement from&nbsp;two soil layers (surrounding fertilizer
    hotspot and below it). In the pot study, OMF15C&nbsp;caused 24% lower biomass
    and less nutrient recovery derived from fertilizer (N, 11%&nbsp;and P, 8.5%),
    compared to MFNP. In the incubation study, OMF15C exhibited +19%&lt;br&gt;atom%
    15N excess in the combined two soil layers, relative to MFNP, and +28% 33P&nbsp;radioactivity
    in the soil surrounding the hotspot, and &minus;89% in the soil below it. We&nbsp;interpreted
    this as a reduction in nutrient availability of the combined VC + mineral fertilizers,
    due to lower P mobility in soil. The combination of VC with mineral&nbsp;fertilizers
    can reduce P movement in soil. A higher Corg:N:P ratio resulted in lower&nbsp;nutrient
    use efficiency in 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;'
