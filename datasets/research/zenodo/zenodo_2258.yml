  title: Investigating the Resistance Behavior of the Clayey Sand Soil Improved with
    Nano-Silica and Carbon Fibers
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Resistive subsoil is a basic construction necessity in civil works because
    it is the foundation of a structure that distributes the loads effectively, and
    the structure will settle and crack under the applied loads if the soil is not
    strong enough. In many cases, the existing natural soil cannot fully support the
    desired structure and needs to be improved for its resistance properties. Soil
    stabilization methods are: 1) mechanical, 2) chemical and 3) physical , and this
    study tries to examine how the combined carbon fibers-nanosilica, as a new stabilizer,
    improves the mechanical characteristics of the soil by studying the effects of
    nano-silica and recycled polyester fibers on the engineering features of the clayey
    sand soil, especially the shear and unconfined compressive strengths. To this
    end, two different-ratio soil-fiber and soil-nano silica combinations, ranging,
    respectively, between 0 and 0.6% and 0 and 1% were used, and the results showed
    that adding the mentioned stabilizers increased the soil strength.&lt;/p&gt;'
