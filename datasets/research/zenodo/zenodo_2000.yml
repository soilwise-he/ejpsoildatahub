  title: Impact of Strength-Enhancing Admixtures on Stabilization of Expansive Soil
    by Addition of Alternative Binders
  abstract: In this study, the stabilization process is introduced to a clayey expansive
    soil collected in southern Sweden. The tests examined strength parameters of expansive
    soil stabilized by different binders using combination of both traditional binders
    (cement and lime) and alternative materials (slag Merit 5000, fly ash from SCA
    Lilla Edet and fly ash from coal combustion, ISO certified). The practical goal
    was to find a binder mixture that is optimized for soil stabilization with respect
    to technical properties of stabilizing agent as an inert ballast material. The
    strength of soil stabilized by various binders was examined by velocity of the
    P-waves propagating through specimens. The results show that introducing slag
    Merit 5000 as an admixture to cement and lime is an effective approach in enhancing
    strength properties in weak soil, which increases bearing capacity of soil for
    planned construction works. The results also shown that a mixture of lime and
    bio ash yields a better effect in the stabilization of a clay. Soil stabilized
    with cement, cement/slag and lime/slag becomes resistant to freeze-thaw cycles,
    which is crucial for construction of roads and building foundations.
