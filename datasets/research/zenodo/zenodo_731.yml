  title: Heavy Metals Spatial Distribution In Soil Ecosystem Components Roadside Territories
  abstract: 'The accumulation and spatial distribution of some heavy metals in the
    soil is the component of the ecosystems of roadside territories.


    The processes of accumulation and spatial distribution are considered taking into
    account the buffer capacity of the traffic flow. Analysis of the buffer capacity
    of soils in relation to the accumulation of heavy metals is performed using the
    parameters of the particle size distribution, humus content, pH level. Chemical
    methods of investigation were used, description of roadside phytocenoses was performed.


    The analysis of the vertical and horizontal distribution of a number of heavy
    metals is performed, which showed certain regularities, which are reflected in
    the conclusion of the work.


    The greatest differences between the values in the content of mobile forms of
    heavy metals are the ones for zinc and lead.'
