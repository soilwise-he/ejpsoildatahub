  title: Effects of Soil Quality on the Microbial Community Structure of Poorly Evolved
    Mediterranean Soils
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Physical and chemical alterations may affect the microbiota
    of soils as much as the specific&nbsp;presence of toxic pollutants. The relationship
    between the microbial diversity patterns and the soil&nbsp;quality in a Mediterranean
    context is studied here to test the hypothesis that soil microbiota is strongly&nbsp;affected
    by the level of anthropogenic soil alteration. Our aim has been to determine the
    potential effect&nbsp;of organic matter loss and associated changes in soil microbiota
    of poorly evolved Mediterranean&nbsp;soils (Leptosols and Regosols) suffering
    anthropogenic stress (i.e., cropping and deforestation). The&nbsp;studied soils
    correspond to nine different sites which differed in some features, such as the
    parent&nbsp;material, vegetation cover, or soil use and types. A methodological
    approach has been used that&nbsp;combines the classical physical and chemical
    study of soils with molecular characterization of the&nbsp;microbial assemblages
    using specific primers for Bacteria, Archaea and ectomycorrhizal Fungi. In&lt;br&gt;agreement
    with previous studies within the region, physical, chemical and biological characteristics&nbsp;of
    soils varied notably depending on these factors. Microbial biomass, soil organic
    matter, and moisture,&nbsp;decreased in soils as deforestation increased, even
    in those partially degraded to substitution&nbsp;shrubland. Major differences
    were observed in the microbial community structure between the&nbsp;mollic and
    rendzic Leptosols found in forest soils, and the skeletic and dolomitic Leptosols
    in substitute&nbsp;shrublands, as well as with the skeletic and dolomitic Leptosols
    and calcaric Regosols in dry croplands.&lt;br&gt;Forest soils displayed a higher
    microbial richness (OTU&rsquo;s number) and biomass, as well as more stable&nbsp;and
    connected ecological networks. Here, we point out how human activities such as
    agriculture&nbsp;and other effects of deforestation led to changes in soil properties,
    thus affecting its quality driving&nbsp;changes in their microbial diversity and
    biomass patterns. Our findings demonstrate the potential&nbsp;risk that the replacement
    of forest areas may have in the conservation of the soil&rsquo;s microbiota pool,&nbsp;both
    active and passive, which are basic for the maintenance of biogeochemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;'
