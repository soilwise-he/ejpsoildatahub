  title: Organic Source as a Technological Option for Soil Carbon Sequestration
  abstract: "The role of organic matter (SOM) in soil fertility has long been known.\
    \ The relationship between dark soil and use of organic waste and agricultural\
    \ production were observed for thousands of years. Recently the study of the humified\
    \ fraction of soil organic matter (SOM), the humic substances (HS), has received\
    \ new interest in view of its extremely important role in environmental protection.\
    \ In humid and hot tropical environments, soil due to the pronounced weathering\
    \ process resulting in an intense removal of silica and bases by lixiviation,\
    \ are acids and consequently, have low natural fertility. Humic substances comprise\
    \ a mixture of colloidal molecules without discrete and defined chemical structure\
    \ with variable C,N,H,O and S contents and varying size, shape, according to Environmental\
    \ conditions . The valley (plain area) at the center surrounded by hill chains\
    \ is 10% only. Manipur has an area of 49.25% forest and 6.65% as occupied by agri\
    \ -land i.e. cultivated land. Manipur has nine different districts namely, Sanapati,\
    \ Urkhul, Churachandpur, Chandel, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Imphal East, Tamenglong\
    \ and Imphal West. Out of this nine districts soil samples were collected from\
    \ seven districts namely Senapati, Churachandpur, Chandel, Imphal East, Thoubal,\
    \ Imphal West and Bishnupur district. As productivity of soils can be sustained\
    \ with the use of organics. It has been realized that intervention of organic\
    \ manures as manurial schedule to maintain the soils health and productivity and\
    \ more view in conserving soil carbon. The overall strategy is to increase SOC\
    \ density, distribution of SOC in the sub-soil, aggregation, and formation of\
    \ secondary carbonates. The SOC density can be enhanced by increasing C input,\
    \ main focus to organic source like Vermicompost, Biosource and FYM into the soil\
    \ and decreasing losses by erosion, mineralization and leaching. A study was conducted\
    \ to assess the organic matter and content of humic and Fulvic acid in Manipur\
    \ under different land uses system viz. Forest, Terrace and cultivated soil. A\
    \ composite soil samples from three different land use systems of Manipur were\
    \ studied in surface soil The mean pH of forest, terrace and cultivated soil was\
    \ 4.85, 5.10 and 5.39 and their corresponding percentage organic carbon content\
    \ were 1.05%, 0.99%, 1.685% respectively. Humic acid, the alkali soluble humic\
    \ fraction was found highest in forest soil than cultivated and terrace lands.\
    \ The average value of humic acid content in forest, terrace and cultivated soils\
    \ were 0.75, 0.35 and 0.57g/10\xA2 of soil respectively. Being the soil of Manipur\
    \ is acidic; fulvic acid content was high in terrace soils. The respective average\
    \ value of fulvic acid content in forest, terrace and cultivated soils were 1.58.1.75.1.59g/10g\
    \ of soil. Vermicompost, biofetilizers and FYM as an organic source were undertaken\
    \ to study the effect of organic manures in soil parameters and yield of cabbage\
    \ (Brassica olerecia var. capitata) in an acid soil. The organic carbon was 2.55%\
    \ and the highest yield of cabbage was obtained with the application of Vermicompost\
    \ at 3 t/ ha with Azospirillum (17.89 t/ha), which show significantly superior\
    \ over FYM. The post harvest organic carbon content of soil was significantly\
    \ improved with the use of vermicompost."
