  title: The effect of siliceous minerals and composites on their basis on allelopathic
    regime of soil under 30-year old plantations of apple and peach trees
  abstract: "<strong>Objective </strong>\u2013 to study the effect of the application\
    \ of siliceous minerals and organomineral mixtures on their basis to improve allelopathic\
    \ regime of the rhizosphere soil under 30-year apple and peach trees in the model\
    \ laboratory experiments.\n\n<strong>Material and methods. </strong>The object\
    \ of the study is the rhizosphere soil collected from under the 30-year-old apple\
    \ and peach trees of the collections of M.M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden\
    \ of the NAS of Ukraine at the phase of bud formation. Siliceous minerals and\
    \ mixtures based on them were applied at a concentration of 1 : 1000 and incubated\
    \ in the soil for 5 months. Before the experiments started, the content of nutrients,\
    \ humus and pH of soil solution had been determined. During the incubation period,\
    \ the allelopathic activity of the soil was determined every two weeks by direct\
    \ bioassay technique. The content of free phenolic compounds in the soil solution\
    \ was analyzed after 14 and 104 days after the start of the experiment. Statistical\
    \ analysis was conducted using the programs Statistica 10.0 and Microsoft Excel\
    \ 7.0.\n\n<strong>Results</strong>. It was established that all investigated minerals\
    \ and mixtures on their basis contributed to the reduction of phytotoxicity of\
    \ the soil and the content of free phenolic compounds in the soil solution. The\
    \ effect size positively correlated with the term of their incubation in the soil.\
    \ The mixture of peat with tripoli in the ratio of 70 : 30 was the most effective\
    \ in improving the allelopathic regime of soil from under the old apple and peach\
    \ plantings.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>. The prospects of application of siliceous\
    \ minerals mixed with peat and sapropel to overcome allelopathic soil sickness\
    \ in 30-year-old apple and peach plantings have been shown."
