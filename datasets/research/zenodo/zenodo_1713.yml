  title: An Experimental Study on Stabilization of Clayey Soil by Using Granulated
    Blast Furnace Slag
  abstract: 'Many of the areas in India contains clayey soil, for these soils Geotechnical
    properties are a week, which affects the stability of the soil. As Ground granulated
    blast furnace slag contains in this study, we received the Ground granulated blast
    furnace slag from steel plant waste mixing with clayey soil to enhance geotechnical
    properties and make it more suitable for use. In this effect of stabilized soil
    and change in geotechnical properties. Treatment of clayey soil using with GGBS
    is very simple, economical and pollution control. Ground granulated blast furnace
    slag GGBS and this material are obtained from the blast furnace of cement plant,
    which is the by product of iron from ACC plant, Sindri . It is generally obtained
    in three shaped one is air cooled, foamed shaped and another is in granulated
    shaped. The use of by product materials for stabilization has environmental and
    economic benefits. Ground granulated blast furnace slag GGBS material is used
    in the current work to stabilize soil clay . Ground granulated blast furnace slag
    which can be used as a stabilizer. GGBS were mixed in clayey soil in different
    proportions and various geotechnical characteristics are investigated through
    Unconfined Compression Test, Compaction Test, CBR test results show that addition
    of Ground Granulated blast furnace slag has a significant effect in geotechnical
    Characteristics of clayey soil. B. Ramesh | P. Hima Bindu "An Experimental Study
