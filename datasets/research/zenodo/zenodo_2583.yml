  title: Expansive Soil Improvement with Limestone and  Iron Oxide Mixture Case Studies
    at the Tomata-Beteleme National Road Segment
  abstract: 'Stabilising expansive road subgrade by adding natural limestone and iron
    oxide is an efficient and economically valuable way of utilising local materials
    and solving iron oxide waste in environmental problems. In this study, the composition
    of the mixture was made with proportions: limestone at the optimum level of 6%
    and iron oxide with varying levels of 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.6%. As support
    in this study, X-ray Diffraction tests and SEM photographs were also conducted
    to determine the content and composition of expansive clay minerals before and
    after mixing with stabilisation materials. The test results showed the CBR value
    without soaking expansive soil compacted according to standard compaction: 12.31%;
    after being stabilised with 6% limestone and 1.6% iron oxide additive, the value
    increases to 25.37% with an increased ratio of 106.09%. For the original soil
    soaking, the CBR value was 8.65%; after stabilisation with 6% limestone and 1.6%
    iron oxide additive, the value increased to 20.49% with an increase ratio of 136.87%.
    The results of X-ray Diffraction testing and SEM photos show the addition of new
    mineral compounds after the original soil is mixed with limestone and iron oxide
    stabilisation materials, including mineral compounds C-S-H (Calcium Silicate Hydrate).
    This chemical compound has cementation properties.
