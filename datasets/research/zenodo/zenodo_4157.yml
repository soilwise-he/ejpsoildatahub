  title: A comparison of Alpine soil macroinvertebrate communities from European larch
    and Swiss pine forests in the LTSER area "Val Mazia/Matschertal", South Tyrol
  abstract: In the Central Alps the treeline is formed by the European larch (Larix
    decidua Mill.) and<br> the Swiss pine (Pinus cembra L.), shaping the alpine plant
    community Larici-Cembretum.<br> Currently, alpine pastures, which are increasingly
    abandoned in the European Alps,<br> are colonised, after a phase of shrub encroachment,
    by the European larch, while a<br> Swiss pine forest will establish once the undergrowth
    becomes too dense for larch<br> trees. Former studies on tree growth rates indicate
    that the European larch will react<br> positively to increasing temperatures at
    the treeline and will grow faster in the future.<br> The Swiss pine has in general
    slower growth rates and will likely be less affected by<br> higher temperatures.
    Thus, there might be a change from Swiss pine to European larch<br> forests at
    the tree line.<br> This change in the dominating tree species might have profound
    impacts on the soil<br> macro-invertebrate community, particularly due to differing
    chemical and physical<br> compositions of larch and pine needle litter. To investigate
    potential effects of this<br> change, we took soil core and litter samples and
    further installed pitfall traps in pure<br> European larch and Swiss pine forests,
    as well as in mixed forests.<br> We found no explicit differences in species composition
    between forests, presumably<br> due to highly variable site and environmental
    parameters between and within forest<br> types. The larch forests showed the highest
    number of taxa in general and the highest<br> number of taxa found exclusively
    in this habitat. The pine forests were inhabited by the<br> highest number of
    characteristic taxa while mixed forests harboured the most stable<br> and consistent
    soil macro-invertebrate community.
