  title: Simulation Of Soil-Pile Interaction Of Steel Batter Piles Penetrated In Sandy
    Soil Subjected To Pull-Out Loads
  abstract: "Superstructures like offshore platforms, tall buildings, transition towers,\
    \ skyscrapers and bridges are normally designed to resist compression, uplift\
    \ and lateral forces from wind waves, negative skin friction, ship impact and\
    \ other applied loads. Better understanding and the precise simulation of the\
    \ response of batter piles under the action of independent uplift loads is a vital\
    \ topic and an area of active research in the field of geotechnical engineering.\
    \ This paper investigates the use of finite element code (FEC) to examine the\
    \ behaviour of model batter piles penetrated in dense sand, subjected to pull-out\
    \ pressure by means of numerical modelling. The concept of the Winkler Model (beam\
    \ on elastic foundation) has been used in which the interaction between the pile\
    \ embedded depth and adjacent soil in the bearing zone is simulated by nonlinear\
    \ p-y curves. The analysis was conducted on different pile slenderness ratios\
    \ (lc\u2044d) ranging from 7.5, 15.22 and 30 respectively. In addition, the optimum\
    \ batter angle for a model steel pile penetrated in dense sand has been chosen\
    \ to be 20\xB0 as this is the best angle for this simulation as demonstrated by\
    \ other researcher published in literature. In this numerical analysis, the soil\
    \ response is idealized as elasto-plastic and the model piles are described as\
    \ elastic materials for the purpose of simulation. The results revealed that the\
    \ applied loads affect the pullout pile capacity as well as the lateral pile response\
    \ for dense sand together with varying shear strength parameters linked to the\
    \ pile critical depth. Furthermore, the pile pull-out capacity increases with\
    \ increasing the pile aspect ratios."
