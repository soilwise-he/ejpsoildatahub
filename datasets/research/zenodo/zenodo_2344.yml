  title: A Baseline Assessment of Soil Organic Carbon in the Mangroves of the Bakassi
    Peninsula South West Cameroon
  abstract: 'The mangrove soils as one of the global soil types is a major carbon
    store that helps to curb the rising global temperatures. This is not unconnected
    to their high carbon storing and sequestration potentials of the peat soils. The
    conclusion is characterized by some knowledge gaps on the actual carbon stock
    and sequestration potentials of some mangroves soils on the Central African Sub
    regional landscape. Some of these areas are the Bakassi mangroves in the South
    West Cameroon. Cross border conflicts, piracy and over exploitation have rendered
    the sourcing of appropriate data on its carbon stock and sequestration potentials
    difficult. In strive to bridge this knowledge gap, this work carried out baseline
    assessments of the carbon stock and sequestration rate of this peat soil. To achieve
    the study objectives, stratified random opportunistic sampling using an inventory
    design based on five forest canopy height classes, with collection of peat soils
    using a soil auger to different depth for laboratory analysis was done. Soils
    Organic Carbon stocks were estimated from soils to a depth of 100cm and determined
    using chromic acid digestion and spectrophotometric analysis. Parameters determined
    were bulk density and percentage carbon. Results showed that soil carbon stock
    density ranged from 705.8 Mg ha to 546.2 Mg ha . Thus on average, for a hectare
    in Bakassi, the Soil Organic carbon stock was 632.65 Mg ha Kamah Pascal Bumtu
