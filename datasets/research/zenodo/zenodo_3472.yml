  title: The Effect of Soil and Foliar Fertilization with Iron on Yield and Leaf Chemical
    Composition of Four Spotted Bean Cultivars in a Calcareous Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Legumes are one of the main protein sources for human beings
    and animals. Bean by 20- 25% protein, 55 -56% carbohydrates and 1-5% lipid plays
    a basic rule in the nutrition of poor nations. So the increase of yield and quality
    of bean can be an efficient way for reduction of protein loss in the developing
    countries. One of the efficient factors in reduction of bean yield and quality
    in the calcareous soils is lack of iron. High reaction and lime amount and extra
    bicarbonate of calcareous soils cause leaves chlorosis which reduces growth, yield
    and quality of bean. In the calcareous soils, absorption of less application elements
    especially iron in the majority of agricultural products in the bean farming which
    is sensitive to iron lack encountered with difficulty and its lack is clearly
    observable. According to farming observations, various type of bean have different
    potentials from the yield view spotted and there is probability that they have
    different reaction towards the iron lack, so it is necessary to study in this
    ground in order to determine the reaction of these figures to iron in various
    fertilizers. In this regard and in order to improve, bean products quality and
    increase the yield level of this product to the most probable level, it is necessary
    to investigate the effect of sources fertilizer methods (soil consume- sparing)
    on the yield and the quality of this product. In order to inspect the number,
    sources and various methods of iron fertilizer consuming on micro elements and
    chemical compound, variants kinds of spotted bean in a limy soil, a green hones
    trial by 44 treatments and 3 iterates it erases in the factorial form and in the
    form of complete incidental sign in the zanjan agriculture university of Iran
    were implemented. In this testing, the consumption of sulphoric acid in watering
    (2 g/L ),4 g/L) , soil application of Ferrous sulfate (25 mg/ in each kilogram
    soli), 50 mg/ in each kilogram soli) , soil application of Fe-EDTA(3 mg/ in each
    kilogram soli), 6 mg/ in each kilogram soli) , spraying Ferrous sulfate by density
    of 2 and 4 g/ L and spraying Fe- EDTA by density of 1 and 2 g/ L are considered
    as iron treatments. By the way an evidence cure is also performed on four types
    of the spotted bean including Talash, khomein, COS 16 and Local. The result of
    analysis of the data variance Clemton started that the types Talash and khomein
    were superior to other kinds from the yield of the seed weight of 100 seeds, numbers
    of the seeds in the sheath viewpoint. The Local and Talash beans were preferred
    to other kinds. The treatment of sulphoric acid application in irrigation water
    (4 g/L) has the higher level of average compared to other treatments of iron.
    The treatment of sulphoric acid application in irrigation water causes the increase
    of manganese, zinc and copper of the leaves in the spotted bean types.&lt;/p&gt;'
