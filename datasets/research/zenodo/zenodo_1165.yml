  title: Cross-Biome Drivers of Soil Bacterial Alpha Diversity on a Worldwide Scale
  abstract: We lack a defined suite of attributes that allow us to universally predict
    the distribution of bacterial diversity across and within globally distributed
    biomes. Using data from a global survey, including 237 locations and multiple
    environmental predictors, we found that only ultraviolet light, forest environments,
    soil carbon and pH can be considered as significant and globally consistent predictors
    of soil bacterial diversity, valid within and across biomes (arid, temperate and
    continental). Bacterial diversity always peaked in grasslands, with moderate-to-low
    carbon and ultraviolet light levels, and high soil pH. Using these environmental
    data, we generated the first global predictive map of the distribution of soil
    bacterial diversity. Our work helps to identify a unique set of environmental
    attributes for universally predicting the distribution of soil bacterial diversity.
    This knowledge is key to help predict changes in ecosystem functioning and the
    provision of essential services under changing environments.
