  title: A review of research in soil fertility management and plant nutrition of
    cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) in Nigeria
  abstract: The paper reviewed researches conducted in soil fertility management and
    plant nutrition of cashew in Nigeria. It also examines the history and importance
    of cashew to the Nigerian economy. The paper highlights ways of improving soil
    fertility and plant nutrition in cashew cultivation through the use of different
    sources of organic fertilizers which are cheap and readily available for the farmers
    rather than total dependence on costly chemical fertilizers. Also highlighted,
    are some recommended rates of organic and inorganic fertilizers for the cultivation
    of cashew from research findings. The paper also discussed status of Nigeria cashew
    production, research efforts, achievements, constraints, and areas of possible
    improvement in relation to soil fertility management and plant nutrition.
