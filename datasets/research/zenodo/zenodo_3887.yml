  title: 'Biogas From Cover Crops And Field Residues: Effects On Soil, Water, Climate
    And Ecological Footprint'
  abstract: "Cover or catch crops have beneficial effects for soil, water, erosion,\
    \ etc. If harvested, they also provide feedstock for biogas without competition\
    \ for arable land in regions, where only one main crop can be produced per year.\
    \ On average gross energy yields of approx. 1300 m\xB3 methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)\
    \ ha<sup>-1</sup> can be expected from 4.5 tonnes (t) of cover crop dry matter\
    \ (DM) in Austria. Considering the total energy invested from cultivation to compression\
    \ for biofuel use a net energy yield of about 1000 m\xB3 CH<sub>4</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ is remaining. With the straw of grain maize or Corn Cob Mix (CCM) similar energy\
    \ yields can be achieved. In comparison to catch crops remaining on the field\
    \ as green manure or to complete fallow between main crops the effects on soil,\
    \ water and climate can be improved if cover crops are harvested without soil\
    \ compaction and digestate is returned to the field in an amount equivalent to\
    \ cover crop removal. In this way, the risk of nitrate leaching can be reduced\
    \ approx. by 25% in comparison to full fallow. The risk of nitrous oxide emissions\
    \ may be reduced up to 50% by contrast with cover crops serving as green manure.\
    \ The effects on humus content and erosion are similar or better than those of\
    \ cover crops used as green manure when the same amount of biomass was produced.\
    \ With higher biomass production the positive effects increase even if cover crops\
    \ are harvested and the only digestate is brought back to the fields. The ecological\
    \ footprint of arable farming can be reduced by approx. 50% considering the substitution\
    \ of natural gas with CH<sub>4</sub> produced from cover crops."
