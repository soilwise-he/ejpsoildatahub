  title: CONCEPTS IN THE NETHERLANDS OF RISK ASSESSMENT OF SOIL CONTAMINATION
  abstract: In 1994, a new Soil Protection Act was implemented in The Netherlands.
    It states that risk assessments are to be performed if the intervention value
    is exceeded.. The intervention values reflect potential risks of contaminated
    soil or groundwater for humans or the ecosystem.. The Act also describes in detail
    the methodology to be used.. In the case that an intervention value is exceeded
    by a certain substance, the urgency of remediation has to be defined This is to
    be done by a site-specific risk assessment, determining the current risks posed
    to humans and the ecosystem.. In this article, the Dutch system is critically
    reviewed and compared to a German technique (in development) It is concluded that
    international harmonization is needed in the field of parameters and toxicological
    data that are used in the different models.
