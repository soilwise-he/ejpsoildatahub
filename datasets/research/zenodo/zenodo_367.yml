  title: Contribution of the Aboveground Biomass of Talahib, Saccharum spotaneum L.
    to Soil Fertility Amelioration of Lahar-laden Soil.
  abstract: 'The study attempted to attain the following objective: To evaluate the
    soil fertility management practices in marginal soils at Bulusukan, San Ildefonso,
    Bulacan. Specifically, the study assessed the soil fertility management practices
    of BSWM-JICA techno-demo farms in the following areas of concern: a) phosphorus
    fertility b) nutrients dynamics c) optimal use of organic and inorganic materials
    d) interaction between microorganisms and plants. Results of the study show that
    the low fertility and productivity of marginal land can be improved by using appropriate
    soil fertility management practices. <br> The soil phosphorus problem can be alleviated
    by using inorganic fertilizer like superphosphate. The loss of macronutrients
    like nitrogen and potassium through leaching can be reduced by using organic fertilizer
    alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer. The use of organic fertilizers
    in combination with organic fertilizers can also significantly increase the kernel
    yield of corn. Microorganisms like rhizobia used as inoculants can increase peanut
    dry matter yield, pod and seed weight especially in combination with soil ameliorants
    like rice hull and lime. Treatments with the higher application of phosphorus
    produced the highest yield. <br>'
