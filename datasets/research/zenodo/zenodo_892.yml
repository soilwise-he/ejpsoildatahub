  title: Rice Varietal Reactions to Iron Toxicity on Acid Sulfate Soil
  abstract: This article 'Rice Varietal Reactions to Iron Toxicity on Acid Sulfate
    Soil' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series, created by
    the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective of this
    publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the
    development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems.
    This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the production
    of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce
    nations in the world.
