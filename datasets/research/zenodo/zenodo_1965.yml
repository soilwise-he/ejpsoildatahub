  title: 'Gridded soil surface nitrogen surplus on grazing and agricultural land:
    Impact of land use maps'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;ExcessNapplication on agricultural land greatly impacts the
    environment in multiple ways, driven by&lt;br&gt;

    population growth and improving quality of human diets. Therefore, it is essential
    to quantify the&lt;br&gt;

    sources of the emissions ofNcompounds and their determinants (e.g. biologicalNfixation
    (BNF),&lt;br&gt;

    mineral fertilizer, manureNandNdeposition) to develop adequate mitigation measures.
    Here we aim&lt;br&gt;

    at comprehensively mapping and quantifyingNfluxes on agricultural land to analyze
    these sources on&lt;br&gt;

    different scales. As underlying grazing land maps used for such calculations are
    fairly different in terms&lt;br&gt;

    of methodology and definition and thus spatial extent and pattern, we investigate
    how this diversity in&lt;br&gt;

    grazing land maps affects quantification ofNindicators.Wecompared three different
    global grazing&lt;br&gt;

    land maps and analyzed the propagation of differences to discrepancies inNindicators
    calculated&lt;br&gt;

    from them.Wediscovered that (i) area differences propagated to high discrepancies
    inNsurplus&lt;br&gt;

    mostly in Asia, and to a minor extent also in Europe and Northern Africa. (ii)
    BNF constitutes an&lt;br&gt;

    important translator for differences on grazing land toNindicators, while also
    being a source of&lt;br&gt;

    further uncertainty, which warrants further scrutiny. (iii) A more inclusive definition
    of grazing land&lt;br&gt;

    results in overall lessNsurplus given the larger areas included but allows to
    provide a more&lt;br&gt;

    comprehensive estimate of the influence of human activity on theNcycle. This study
    is the first to&lt;br&gt;

    provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of grazing land and agricultural land
    area differences on&lt;br&gt;

    variousNbudget terms andNindicator calculation, highlighting opportunities for
    further research,&lt;br&gt;

    and the importance of a comprehensive accounting ofNsurplus when using an inclusive
    definition of&lt;br&gt;

    grazing land.&lt;/p&gt;'
