  title: Development of a soil regenerator with a granular nozzle for greenhouses
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The results of the development of a regenerative-type heat exchange
    unit for greenhouses are presented. The creation of a soil regenerator is conditioned
    by energy and economic expediency. In spring in the daytime, the air in greenhouses
    is intensely heated by solar radiation, and at night it can be cooled below the
    allowable temperature. Heat accumulation during the day and using this heat at
    night will reduce the need for heaters even to their complete exclusion. The soil
    regenerator contains a dense layer of granular material that is blown through
    by the air from the inner space of a greenhouse. This solution makes it possible
    to intensify significantly the heat exchange. To determine the mean intercomponent
    heat exchange factor, the empirical dependence, taking into consideration the
    effect of duration of the heat exchange process, was obtained. We developed the
    procedure of thermal design calculation of a regenerator, using which the main
    geometric characteristics of the heat exchange area are determined. The results
    of the calculation of the soil regenerator for a greenhouse with the surface area
    of 18&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;for the conditions of the warm continental
    climate were presented. The developed soil regenerator contains 5&nbsp;channels
    that are 5.75&nbsp;m long, filled with rubble. It was obtained that for the average
    solar radiation flow Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=2,160&nbsp;W and the duration of
    operation of the soil regenerator &tau;&lt;sub&gt;&Sigma;&lt;/sub&gt;=6&nbsp;hours,
    the accumulated heat at night can be consumed for 2.6&nbsp;hours at the average
    ambient temperature t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=7&nbsp;&deg;C. As the ambient temperature
    rises, the time of regenerator operation will increase. The proposed soil regenerator
    is characterized by the design simplicity and its application will lead to an
    increase in energy costs to maintain the temperature mode in a greenhouse&lt;/p&gt;'
