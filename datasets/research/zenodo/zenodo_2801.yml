  title: Carcinogenicity and Distribution of PCBs in Soil from Electrical Transformers
    Installation Sites in Uvwie Local Government Area, Delta State, Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Most nations have outlawed the use of polychlorinated\
    \ biphenyls (PCBs), a group of chemical substances that are classified as persistent\
    \ organic pollutants (POP). They were mostly utilised in paint, retardants, plasticizers,\
    \ lubricants, transformers, and capacitors. PCBs can be released into the atmosphere\
    \ from primary and secondary sources. They are transported over great distances\
    \ by the atmosphere, and as a result, have been found all over the world. PCBs\
    \ were tested in soil near transformer installations at various sites in Uview\
    \ local government area (LGA) in the metropolis of Warri, Delta state, Nigeria.\
    \ The evaluation was done using three different Agilent 6975 GC-MS systems for\
    \ both total PCBs and congeners. The soil samples were cleaned and concentrated\
    \ by column chromatography utilising silica gel and hexane as the eluting solvent.\
    \ The soil samples were extracted with 1:1 hexane-acetone in an ultrasonic bath.\
    \ The Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) of the United States permits a maximum\
    \ PCB concentration of 2.0 mg/kg, but the results show that all areas were polluted\
    \ with PCBs below this limit, with the following values for Enerhen (1.146 \xB1\
    \ 0.023), Ogbomoro (0.340 \xB1 0.28) and Ekpan (0.225 \xB1 0.320) in mg/kg. The\
    \ total cancer risk calculated by adding the cancer risks from ingestion, inhalation,\
    \ and dermal contact in these particular locations corresponds to Enerhen (4.2\xD7\
    10<sup>\u22126</sup>), Ogbomoro (1.25\xD710<sup>\u22126</sup>), and Ekpan (8.26\xD7\
    10<sup>\u22127</sup>), and it was found that all of these locations have extremely\
    \ low to low cancer risks compared to the value advised by the TSCA. <strong>Keywords:</strong>\
