  title: "How does management affect soil C sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes\
    \ in boreal and temperate forests? \u2013 A review"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The global forest carbon (C) stock is estimated at 662 Gt of
    which 45% is in soil organic matter. Thus, comprehensive understanding of the
    effects of forest management practices on forest soil C stock and greenhouse gas
    (GHG) fluxes is needed for the development of effective forest-based climate change
    mitigation strategies. To improve this understanding, we synthesized peer-reviewed
    literature on forest management practices that can mitigate climate change by
    increasing soil C stocks and reducing GHG emissions. We further identified soil
    processes that affect soil GHG balance and discussed how models represent forest
    management effects on soil in GHG inventories and scenario analyses to address
    forest climate change mitigation potential. Forest management effects depend strongly
    on the specific practice and land type. Intensive timber harvesting with removal
    of harvest residues/stumps results in a reduction in soil C stock, while high
    stocking density and enhanced productivity by fertilization or dominance of coniferous
    species increase soil C stock. Nitrogen fertilization increases the soil C stock
    and N2O emissions while decreasing the CH4 sink. Peatland hydrology management
    is a major driver of the GHG emissions of the peatland forests, with lower water
    level corresponding to higher CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the global warming potential
    of all GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) together can be ten-fold higher after
    clear-cutting than in peatlands with standing trees. The climate change mitigation
    potential of forest soils, as estimated by modelling approaches, accounts for
    stand biomass driven effects and climate factors that affect the decomposition
    rate. A future challenge is to account for the effects of soil preparation and
    other management that affects soil processes by changing soil temperature, soil
    moisture, soil nutrient balance, microbial community structure and processes,
    hydrology and soil oxygen concentration in the models. We recommend that soil
    monitoring and modelling focus on linking processes of soil C stabilization with
    the functioning of soil microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;'
