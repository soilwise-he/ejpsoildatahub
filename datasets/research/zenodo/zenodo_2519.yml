  title: Effects of Slope on Soil Properties in The Rangeland of Southern Al-Jabal
    Al -Akhdar Region, Northeastern Libya
  abstract: <strong>Aims</strong>. This study was conducted on southern slope of Al-Jabal
    Al-Akhdar, Libya to estimate some soil properties, and to study effects of slope
    on those properties. <strong>Methods</strong>. Twelve sites were selected. Slope
    in the study area was divided into three levels (high slope, medium slope and
    low slope). Soil samples were collected for each site and analyzed in laboratory.
    We applied LFA technique to assess soil surface condition. One-way ANOVA (LSD
    test) was applied, where slope is independent factor and soil properties are dependent
    variables. <strong>Results</strong>. The results did not show any significant
    differences between soil properties, except for soil PH and calcium carbonate.
    Also, there were no significant differences between the means of soil surface
    indices except for SSCI. Our results confirmed that the effect of slope became
    significant when its rate exceeds 10%, for this reason, most of the statistical
    differences between soil properties means were insignificant in our study, as
    the highest rate of slope in the study area is 7%. <strong>Conclusion</strong>.
    It is necessary to conduct future studies to cover a larger area in the region
    for a comprehensive understanding about soil properties at the local level, and
    thus knowing the proper ways to maintain and benefit from it.
