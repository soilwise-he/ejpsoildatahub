  title: Sensitivity in the Overland Reintensification of Tropical Cyclone Erin (2007)
    to Near-Surface Soil Moisture Characteristics
  abstract: "This study investigates the impact of abnormally moist soil conditions\
    \ across the southern Great Plains upon the overland reintensification of North\
    \ Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Erin (2007). This is tested by analyzing the contributions\
    \ of three soil moisture\u2013related signals\u2014a seasonal signal, an along-track\
    \ rainfall signal, and an early postlandfall rainfall signal\u2014to the intensity\
    \ of the vortex. In so doing, a suite of nine convection-permitting numerical\
    \ simulations using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model\
    \ (WRF-ARW) is used. Of the signals tested, soil moisture contributions from the\
    \ anomalously wet months preceding Erin are found to have the greatest positive\
    \ impact upon the intensity of the vortex, though this impact is on the order\
    \ of that from climatological soil moisture conditions. The greatest impact of\
    \ the early rainfall signal contributions is found when it is added to the seasonal\
    \ signal. Along-track rainfall during the simulation period has a minimal impact.\n\
    \nVariations in soil moisture content result in impacts upon the boundary layer\
    \ thermodynamic environment via boundary layer mixing. Greater soil moisture content\
    \ results in weaker mixing, a shallower boundary layer, and greater moisture and\
    \ instability. Differences in the intensity of convection that develops and its\
    \ accompanying latent heat release aloft result in greater warm-core development\
    \ and surface vortex intensification within the simulations featuring greater\
    \ soil moisture content. Implications of these findings to the tropical cyclone\
    \ development process are discussed. Given that the reintensification is shown\
    \ to occur in, apart from land, an otherwise favorable environment for tropical\
    \ cyclone development and results in a vortex with a structure similar to developing\
    \ tropical cyclones, these findings provide new insight into the conditions under\
    \ which tropical cyclones develop."
