  title: Effects of Moringa oleifera (Lam.) Plant Parts as Soil Amendment on the Performance
    of Some Agricultural Crops in a Screenhouse Environment
  abstract: '<strong>ABSTRACT</strong> The effectiveness of moringa leaf blade (MLB),
    leaf petiole (MLP), seed (MS) and flower (MF) on the performance of amaranth and
    okra were evaluated in a screen house using 100 kg N/ha and their residual effects
    were investigated with millet. The experiment was laid in completely randomized
    design involving amaranth and okra, four moringa amendments and control and replicated
    five times to give a total of 50 pots. Four amaranths and two okra per pot were
    evaluated for dry biomass yield at five weeks after sowing (WAS). Residual effects
    of the amendments were investigated on 30 millets per pot for dry biomass yield
    at 12 WAS. Data were analysed using ANOVA at 5% probability. Amaranth and okra
    yield from MLB (0.75 and 1.37 g/plant) and MLP (0.69 and 1.24 g/plant) were significantly
    higher than MS (0.50 and 1.01 g/plant), MF (0.41 and 0.96 g/plant) and control
    (0.24 and 0.58 g/plant). Furthermore, yield of millet from residual effect differed
    significantly in the order of control (0.13 and 0.10 g/plant) &lt; MF (0.19 and
    0.17 g/plant) &lt; MS (0.29 and 0.23 g/plant) &lt; MLP (0.36 and 0.31 g/plant)
    &lt;MLB (0.42 and 0.39 g/plant). Moringa leaf blade and petiole at 100 kg N/ha
    improved biomass yield of amaranth and okra as well as millet in the first and
    second cropping respectively. <strong>Keywords: Moringa amendment, Screenhouse,
