  title: USE OF ASSOCIATED MICROORGANISMS AS POTENTIAL BIOFERTILIZERS FOR SOIL FERTILITY
    AND LIMITING PLANT PATHOGENS
  abstract: <em>Microorganisms present in the plant rhizosphere and tissues absorb
    atmospheric nitrogen and synthesize various physiologically active substances,
    regulate the nutrient balance of the plant, and have an antagonistic activity
    against phytopathogens by positively influencing its growth and development. has
    Taking into account the fact that our research is carried out depending on the
    state of the microbe-plant association in limiting phytopathogens, bacteria belonging
    to the genera Azotobacter and Bacillus were isolated and identified.</em>
