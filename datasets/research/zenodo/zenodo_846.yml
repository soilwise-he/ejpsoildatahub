  title: Urban Scale Fragility Assessment of Structures Considering Soil-Structure-Interaction
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Fragility curves for structures are typically calculated considering&lt;br&gt;

    fixed-base structures, i.e., neglecting the interaction between soil, foundation,
    and&lt;br&gt;

    structure (SFSI). The state-of-the-art literature proves that considering foundation&lt;br&gt;

    flexibility, especially for structures resting on soft soil, may lead to different&lt;br&gt;

    fragility or loss estimates than the fixed-base-on-rock assumption. Including
    these&lt;br&gt;

    effects on the city-scale vulnerability analysis is considered a challenging task&lt;br&gt;

    due to the high exposure concentration and complexity of all the interacting urban&lt;br&gt;

    systems. For this reason, large-scale analyses are commonly carried out applying&lt;br&gt;

    existing fragility curves which may have been assessed not correctly accounting&lt;br&gt;

    for the variation in frequency and amplitude contents imposed by each site&rsquo;s
    local&lt;br&gt;

    geotechnical and topographic conditions. To this aim, a new simplified methodology&lt;br&gt;

    is proposed in this study to perform an urban-scale vulnerability assessment&lt;br&gt;

    of structures considering the influence of SFSI and local site-effects. The applicability&lt;br&gt;

    of the proposed approach is based on globally available data regarding&lt;br&gt;

    the soil parameters, the foundation, and the building taxonomy. The main findings&lt;br&gt;

    demonstrate that the conventional way of calculating fragility curves may lead
    to&lt;br&gt;

    an incorrect evaluation of the seismic risk, especially in soft soil formations.&lt;/p&gt;'
