  title: Effect Type and Dosage of Bokashion the Content of C, N, P, and K in Alluvial
    Soil
  abstract: 'The utilization of dry land is one alternative that can be used to increase
    national agricultural production, but the productivity of dry land is generally
    low due to low fertility levels. Efforts to increase the productivity of agricultural
    land can be made, one of which is by providing organic fertilizer. The research
    objectives were: (1) to determine the content of C, N, P, and K elements in quail
    manure bokashi and pineapple skin bokashi; (2) to determine the impact of giving
    these two bokashi on the content of C- organic, N-total, P-available, and K-available
    after incubation for 3, 6 and 9 weeks. The research was carried out from January
    to March 2023 in Samboja District, Kutai Kartanegara Regency, East Kalimantan
    Province. This research was conducted using a quantitative descriptive method
    consisting of 7 treatments and 3 repetitions, namely as follows: p0 = control;
    p1 = bokashi of quail manure 50 g polybag-1; p2 = bokashi of quail manure 100
    g polybag-1; p3 = bokashi of quail manure 150 g polybag-1; p4 = bokashi of pineapple
    skin 50 g polybag-1; p5 = bokashi of pineapple skin 100 g polybag-1; and p6 =
    bokashi of pineapple skin 150 g polybag-1. The research results show that: (1)
    The bokashi of quail manurefertilizer content is: 32.29% C-Organic; 3.19%, N-total;
    C/N ratio 10.12; 41.68 ppm P-available; and 62.63 ppm K-available; The bokashi
    of pineapple skin fertilizer content is: 33.15% C-organic; 1.61% N-total; C/N
    ratio 20.59; 33.37 ppm P- available; and 44.38 ppm K-available; (2) applying quail
    manure bokashi fertilizer to alluvial soil can improve the soil nutrient content
    C-Organic, N, P, and K better than pineapple skin bokashi fertilizer; and (3)
    a good incubation period for bokashi fertilizer is 6 weeks.'
