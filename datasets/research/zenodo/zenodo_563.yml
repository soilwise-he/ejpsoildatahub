  title: What happens in the soil during pile driving?
  abstract: What happens in the soil during pile-driving?<br> A. A graphical method
    is used to determine stress and velocity in rods under dynamic loading conditions.<br>
    Application to a sample of dry sand gives regions of permanent deformation and
    dissipation of energy<br> into friction. Penetration of the energy into the interior
    of the sample is deeper for longer duration of<br> impact. Experiments confirm
    this theoretical result.<br> B. The way sand saturated with water reacts on dynamic
    load is studied by separating stresses and velocities<br> of the two phases. It
    is shown that water bears nearly total dilatation stress, while the granular skeleton<br>
    is affected by rotation for high frequency loading.<br> C. Impedance of rigid
    sphere in infinite, elastic medium is computed in order to obtain information
    about<br> the impedance of a pile-toe in soil. It is shown that for high frequencies
    the load is mostly affecting the<br> water stresses. The different effects of
    these phenomena on the reaction of a pile while driven into the<br> soil are considered.
