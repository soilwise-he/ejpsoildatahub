  title: "Identification of fungal taxa with pathogenic potential in soil samples\
    \ from Perunika Glacier\xE2\u20AC\u2122s newly formed forefields - Livingston\
    \ Island, Antarctica"
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Antarctica peninsula periphery islands undergo one of the most\
    \ dramatic ecological changes due to ongoing global warming. The front fields\
    \ of the Antarctic glaciers are extreme environments and pioneering sites for\
    \ ecological succession. Rising temperatures lead to deglaciation in the Antarctic\
    \ habitats, and the new terrain is subjected to the process of soil formation\
    \ and microbial colonization. In the present study, we investigated the formation\
    \ of pathogenic fungal soil microbiomes as an effect of forefield deglaciation.\
    \ Soil samples were taken from two different forefields, one formed several years\
    \ ago and the other freshly uncovered. Both habitats were in the vicinity of the\
    \ Perunika Glacier situated in the northeastern direction of Hurd Peninsula, Livingston\
    \ Island, the second largest island from the South Shetland Archipelago, about\
    \ 100 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. Total DNA was extracted and targeted\
    \ ITS amplicon sequencing was applied. The ITS marker sequences were then taxonomically\
    \ identified. The abundance of the fungal taxa was calculated. Alpha and Beta\
    \ diversity analyses to obtain fungal richness in samples were performed. Our\
    \ results showed that soil habitat formation, initiated by deglaciation, was such\
    \ that:&lt;/p&gt;In the newly deglaciated forefield, there was almost no fungal\
    \ DNA, which prevented further analysis;\_At older drier fields metagenome content\
    \ was much higher;\_Further analysis showed that the most abundant genera were\
    \ Pseudogymnoascus, Simplicillium, Hanseniaspora, Mycothermus, and Malassezia.&lt;p&gt;It\
    \ is known that Pseudogymnoascus and Malassezia species have pathogenic keratinolytic\
    \ activity. In conclusion, the phylum Ascomycota, which dominated the core microbiome\
    \ showed much higher ecological diversity and abundance, i.e. potential for colonization\
    \ of the glacier forefields. In contrast, the phylum Basidiomycota appeared to\
    \ be less fit for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;"
