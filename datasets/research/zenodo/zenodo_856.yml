  title: Effects of Untreated Pharmaceutical Effluents on the Soil Physicochemical
    Properties
  abstract: A good agricultural soil is characterized by adequate nutrients and stipulated
    Physicochemical properties. Most agricultural soil in Nigeria has been subjected
    to different kinds of pollutants resulting from anthropogenic activities, notably
    Untreated Pharmaceutical Effluents (UPE) which emerge as the major threatening
    factor to the quality of Nigerian agricultural soil. This study was undertaken
    to X-ray the effects of UPE on the soil Physicochemical properties. UPE samples
    were collected from five major pharmaceutical companies (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5)
    in Anambra State, and these samples were analyzed for Physicochemical properties
    using instrumentation and gravimetric techniques. The Physicochemical analysis
    of the selected agricultural soil samples and UPE-polluted sites (25L/9m2, 50L/9m2
    and 100L/9m2) were also determined. The study revealed that the Physicochemical
    parameters of the UPE were above the stipulated limits of the World Health Organization
    (WHO). There was reduction in the pH, increase in nitrates, sulphates, phosphates
    and significant (P<0.05) reduction in microbial counts of UPE polluted sites,
    mostly in 100L/9m2sites. Therefore, this study has shown that the Physicochemical
    properties were significantly reduced in UPE polluted sites, mostly in 100L/9m2
    site.
