  title: Adoption of Soil and Water Conservation Practices in Southern Ethiopia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil erosion must be reduced to a tolerable level to control
    soil fertility decline and sustainable agricultural development. Different SWC
    works have been done in many parts of Ethiopia. Still, the farmers&#39; perception
    of soil erosion and their responses to soil and water conservation practices need
    investigation. Often contact between planners and stakeholders used to be minimal.
    The failure of conservation programs partly emerges from the fact that planners
    and implementing agencies ignore or fail to consider the socio-economic factors
    as critical determinants of the success or failure of conservation programs. Therefore,
    this study&#39;s objective was to identify what factors affect the adoption of
    physical soil and water conservation practices and examine farmers&#39; perceptions
    of soil and water conservation practices. Both primary and secondary data were
    collected for this purpose. The primary data were collected from 108 proportionately
    and randomly selected sample households from 5 Kebeles in Kindo Koysha Woreda,
    while secondary data were from group discussions of different sources. A multinomial
    logit model was applied to identify the socio-demographic, Economic, Institutional,
    Psychological, and Physical factors that affect Soil and Water Conservation Practices&#39;
    adoption. This study indicated that farmers&#39; adoption of the Soil and Water
    Conservation decision was influenced more by socio-demographic, economic, institutional,
    and physical factors. The household head age, education levels, family size, and
    dependency ratio influenced socio-demographic factors; economic factors influenced
    farm size and household income. The slope category of the farm was of physical
    factor that influenced the adoption of soil water conservation practices. Of these
    significantly influenced variables, the dependency ratio was negatively affected,
    while the rest of the factors positively influenced the adoption of SWC practices.
    Based on the obtained result, the following recommendations were made: There should
    be a clear understanding of the socio-economic conditions of a given locality
    to undertake SWC activity; a closer relationship will need to be developed between
    land-use planners and soil conservationists; strengthening resettlement in unused
    areas; the way of farming culture has to be investigated before planning to undertake
    conservation activity of a given community; To implement SWC, exploring existing
    local resource and availability of farmland is vital because most farmers who
    have stones availability in their locality were replayed that they choose stone
    bunds to protect their farm.&lt;/p&gt;'
