  title: 'Chemical potential of a two-component liquid in porous media: The case of
    unsaturated soil'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to propose a method to determine the\
    \ chemical potential of two miscible components of a solution in porous media,\
    \ particularly in the case of an unsaturated soil. It is limited to the capillary\
    \ state; the equilibrium of the liquid phase in the soil is determined by gas\u2013\
    liquid interfaces whose geometry obeys Laplace's law. Deduction of the chemical\
    \ potential of the two components from the chemical potential of pure water is\
    \ based on the assumption that, for the same volume occupied by the fluid phase\
    \ in the porous medium, the geometry of the fluid phase is independent of the\
    \ composition of the solution. The expressions of the chemical potentials of the\
    \ two components were established. They show the superposition of two effects:\
    \ the effect of interfacial forces and the effect of the presence of the other\
    \ component. A study of the water\u2013alcohol solution in a clayey silty sand\
    \ soil was then conducted to alcohol mole fractions between 0 and 0.15 and water\
    \ content in the 5%\u201315% range. In this field, the chemical potential of the\
    \ water was seen to be affected by the capillary effects below a water content\
    \ of 10%. Above that, its variation as a function of the mole fraction of alcohol\
    \ differed little from that of the potential of the water in a free solution.\
    \ The chemical potential of the alcohol was little affected by the capillary effects.&lt;/p&gt;"
