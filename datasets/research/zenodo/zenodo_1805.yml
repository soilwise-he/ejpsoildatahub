  title: Decline in Number and Viability of Sclerotia of Rice Stem Rot Fungus in Soil
  abstract: This article 'Decline in Number and Viability of Sclerotia of Rice Stem
    Rot Fungus in Soil' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series,
    created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective
    of this publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with
    the development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems.
    This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the production
    of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce
    nations in the world.
