  title: Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) fails to consistently respond to
    N-fertilizer when grown on a Tunica clay soil in the lower Mississippi River Valley,
    USA
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Information on producing grain sorghum (&lt;em&gt;Sorghum bicolor&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;L.
    Moench) on clay soils found in the Mississippi Delta and similar regions is comparatively
    limited to what is known for the crop in other environments, especially regarding
    nitrogen fertility. A study conducted in 2014 and 2015 on a Tunica clay soil (clayey
    over loamy, montmorillonitic, non-acid, thermic, Vertic Halaquept) examined the
    effects of three N-fertilizer rates (0.0, 112.0, and 224.0 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
    on yield and yield components of six commercially available hybrids. The 2014
    seeding did not require irrigation while three irrigations were applied in 2015.
    No yield differences in hybrids or N-fertility treatments were observed in 2014
    likely due to waterlogged soil, resulting in denitrification, but added N did
    increase yields in 2015. No consistent differences in yield or yield components
    occurred between hybrids either year. Yields in 2014 and at 0.0 or 112.0 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;added
    N-fertilizer in 2015 were sub-standard to regional variety trial data. Rates of
    N-fertilizer of at least 224.0 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;appear necessary
    for grain sorghum grown on clay soils in the humid sub-tropics.&lt;/p&gt;'
