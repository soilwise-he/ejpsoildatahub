  title: Screening and characterization of amylase producing bacteria from soil contaminated
    with cassava effluents from Abraka, Delta State | JBES 2022
  abstract: Amylases are starch hydrolyzing enzymes important in normal daily life
    and industry. There are different sources of amylase production however, enzymes
    derived from microorganisms are cheaper and thermos table among other features.
    The aim of this work was to isolate amylase producing bacteria from soil contaminated
    with cassava water effluents and to find out environmental/ optimization of amylase
    production. Soil samples were collected from four different sites. A total of
    50 bacterial were isolated form soil samples, 14 showed area of clear zones on
    starch medium. Isolates that gave maximum yield of amylase were identified molecularly.
    The isolates were optimized for carbon sources, pH, nitrogen sources, incubation
    time, agro waste and chlorides. Biochemical and molecular analysis showed that
    <em>Citrobacter</em> sp and <em>Enterobacter</em> <em>cloaca</em> showed higher
    amylase activity. Glucose, nitrate, pH 7.0, magnesium chloride and temperature
    of 25<sup>o</sup>C produced maximum amylase. Plantain peel was the agro water
    that produced more amylase enzyme. Published by the <strong>Journal of Biodiversity
