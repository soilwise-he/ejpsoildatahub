  title: PHYTOREMEDIATION CAPACITY OF MAIZE (ZEA MAYS) ON DIESEL OIL POLLUTED SOIL
  abstract: The potential of maize plants in the remediation of diesel oil-polluted
    soil was evaluated. Soil samples were polluted with diesel oil in concentrations
    of 100ml, 200ml, 300ml, and 400ml and amendedseparately with poultry droppings.
    Samples wereanalyzed at two weeks intervals for 9 weeks. Results show a significant
    reduction of diesel oil in polluted soil.The effect was concentration dependent.
    Agromorphological parameters that were observed were Petiole Length, Plant Height,
    Leaf Length, Leaf Width, and Number of Leaves. Results obtained showed that as
    the concentration increased the more it reduced the growth of the plant. TPH content
    of diesel oil showed a significant reduction through the growth period, reducing
    from a baseline data of 8502mg/kg to 2843mg/kg. Hence, theplants have a higher
    potential for phytoremediation of diesel-contaminated soils.
