  title: The Effect Of Treated Waste-Water On Compaction And Compression Of Fine Soil
  abstract: "\u2014The main objective of this paper is to study the effect of treated\
    \ waste-water (TWW) on the compaction and compressibility properties of fine soil.\
    \ Two types of fine soils (clayey soils) were selected for this study and classified\
    \ as CH soil and Cl type of soil. Compaction and compressibility properties such\
    \ as optimum water content, maximum dry unit weight, consolidation index and swell\
    \ index, maximum past pressure and volume change were evaluated using both tap\
    \ and treated waste water. It was found that the use of treated waste water affects\
    \ all of these properties. The maximum dry unit weight increased for both soils\
    \ and the optimum water content decreased as much as 13.6% for highly plastic\
    \ soil. The significant effect was observed in swell index and swelling pressure\
    \ of the soils. The swell indexed decreased by as much as 42% and 33% for highly\
    \ plastic and low plastic soils, respectively, when TWW is used. Additionally,\
    \ the swelling pressure decreased by as much as 16% for both soil types. The result\
    \ of this research pointed out that the use of treated waste water has a positive\
    \ effect on compaction and compression properties of clay soil and promise for\
    \ potential use of this water in engineering applications. Keywords\u2014Consolidation,\
    \ proctor compaction, swell index, treated waste-water, volume change."
