  title: The Impact of Soil Water Content on Yield, Composition, Energy, and Water
    Indicators of the Bioenergy Grass Saccharum spontaneum ssp. aegyptiacum under
    Three-Growing Seasons
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Raising water and energy productivity in agriculture can contribute\
    \ to reducing the pressure&nbsp;on the limited freshwater availability and non-renewable\
    \ energy sources. Bioenergy perennial grasses&nbsp;are ecient from a water perspective\
    \ and can a ord a low-energy cultivation system; however, crop&nbsp;selection\
    \ and cultivation practices for minimizing land use change and maximizing resource\
    \ use&lt;br&gt;\neciencies remain a challenging task in view of sustainable bioeconomy\
    \ development. The present&nbsp;work investigated the soil water e ect on a long-term\
    \ plantation of Saccharum (Saccharum spontaneum&nbsp;ssp. aegyptiacum), a bioenergy\
    \ perennial grass holding great promise for semiarid Mediterranean&nbsp;areas.\
    \ The plantation was in its 13th year following establishment and was subjected\
    \ to three levels of&nbsp;irrigation for three successive growing seasons. Regression\
    \ models between crop water use (CWU)&nbsp;and productivity, biomass composition,\
    \ energy, and water indicators showed di erent prediction&nbsp;curves. Raising\
    \ CWU (from 230 to 920 mm) enhanced the dry biomass yield (from 14.8 to 30.1 Mg&nbsp;ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ and the net energy value (from 257.6 to 511 GJ ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).\
    \ On the same CWU range, unirrigated&nbsp;crops improved the energy eciency (from\
    \ 99.8 to 58.5 GJ ha\U001000001), the energy productivity (from 5.6&nbsp;to 3.4\
    \ Mg GJ&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the water productivity (from 114.5 to 56.1\
    \ MJ m\U001000003) by reducing the water&nbsp;footprint (from 8.7 to 17.8 m3 GJ&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).\
    \ Biomass composition was also superior in unirrigated crops,&nbsp;as the lower\
    \ heating value, structural polysaccharides, and the acid detergent lignin were\
    \ higher,&lt;br&gt;\nwhile ash and soluble compounds were lower. Present findings\
    \ demonstrated the good yield levels&nbsp;and persistence of Saccharum, improving\
    \ our knowledge of plant responses to changing soil water&nbsp;availability to\
    \ maximize energy and conserve natural resources, paving the way for sustainable&nbsp;bioeconomy\
    \ development in the Mediterranean area.&lt;/p&gt;"
