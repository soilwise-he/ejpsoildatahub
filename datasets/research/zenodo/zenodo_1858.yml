  title: Spectrophotometric Determination of 2,2-Dichlorovinyldimethyl Phosphate (DDVP)
    and its Application in Water, Soil and Vegetables
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, Ravisbankar University, Raipur-492 010 <em>Manuscript
    received 28 November 1990, revised 9 April 1991, accepted 23 April 1991</em> A
    method has been developed for the spectrophotometric determination of 2,2- dicblorovinyldimethyl
    phosphate (DDVP), a insecticide, based on its alkaline hydrolysis to produce dichloroacetaldbeyde,
    yielding a fluorescent yellow coloured dye with <strong>J</strong> acid when heated
    in concentrated sulphuric acid medium. The method has been successfully applied
    for the determination of <strong>DDVP</strong> in water, soil and vegetables.
