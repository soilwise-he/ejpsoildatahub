  title: Seismic Fragility Curves For Shallow Circular Tunnels Under Different Soil
    Conditions
  abstract: This paper presents a methodology to develop fragility curves for shallow
    tunnels so as to describe a relationship between seismic hazard and tunnel vulnerability.
    Emphasis is given to the influence of surrounding soil material properties because
    the dynamic behaviour of the tunnel mostly depends on it. Four ground properties
    of soils ranging from stiff to soft soils are selected. A 3D nonlinear time history
    analysis is used to evaluate the seismic response of the tunnel when subjected
    to five real earthquake ground intensities. The derived curves show the future
    probabilistic performance of the tunnels based on the predicted level of damage
    states corresponding to the peak ground acceleration. A comparison of the obtained
    results with the previous literature is provided to validate the reliability of
    the proposed fragility curves. Results show the significant role of soil properties
    and input motions in evaluating the seismic performance and response of shallow
    tunnels.
