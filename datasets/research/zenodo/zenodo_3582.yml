  title: 'Heavy Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Roadside Soil Samples:
    A Review'
  abstract: Diverse contaminants released into the environment through progress of
    urbanization and industrialization adversely affect human health. Among various
    sources of contaminants, especially, in big cities, automobiles play a significant
    role in aggravating the pollution. Various pollutants viz., heavy metals (Pb,
    Mn, Ni, Zn, As, Hg, Cd) and Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Benzo-a-pyrene, fluoranthene,
    pyrene, benzo-b-anthracene, benzo-b-fluoranthene, acenaphthylene, fluorine, phenantherene,
    anthracene, chrysene, benzo-k-fluoranthene, benzo-e-pyrene, indenol-1,2,3-cd-pyrene,
    dibenzo-a,h-anthracene, benzo-ghi-perylene) are released by vehicles. Further,
    these pollutants are expected to cause severe mutagenic, genotoxic and carcinogenic
    effects. Considering this, many authors monitored the levels of pollution in roadside
    soil, water and plants. The present review focuses upon the analysis and effects
    of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the roadside samples.
