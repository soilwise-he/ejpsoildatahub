  title: Evaluation of Catchment Afforestation Potentials of Seedlings of Three Native
    Tree Species under Different Soil Moisture Conditions
  abstract: "<em>In many parts of the world, key water catchments and watershed ecosystems\
    \ have been degraded by successive waves of anthropogenic activities, thus requiring\
    \ rehabilitation. One of the drawbacks of rehabilitation of degraded catchments\
    \ is the lack of information about species suitable to local conditions. This\
    \ study was designed to evaluate the catchment afforestation/reforestation potentials\
    \ of three native tree seedlings under different moisture levels. In a complete\
    \ randomised design (3 species x 4 treatments x 12 replicates) in a shade house,\
    \ 144 pots with fairly uniform actively growing seedlings of Markhmia tomentosa,\
    \ Funtumia Africana and Prunus Africana were treated to 4 soil moisture levels,\
    \ corresponding to12.5, 25, 50 and 100% field capacity determined gravimetrically.\
    \ Growth parameters (collar diameter, height and number of leaves) were measured\
    \ fortnightly, while leaf area, biomass components and their derivatives were\
    \ measured destructively after six months of growth. The seedlings\u2019 rate\
    \ of transpiration and evapotranspiration (gH2O/s/m2) were determined gravimetrically\
    \ and water-use efficiency derived (g/L). The general effects of the soil moisture\
    \ capacity on the growth performances were significantly different at P &lt; 0.001.\
    \ Markhmia tomentosa showed maximum leaf number (42) and leaf area (10712.8 cm2,\
    \ 25% treatment), collar diameter (17.8 cm) and root shoot ratio (2.8, 50% treatment).\
    \ Funtumia africana at 50% soil moisture capacity showed maximum height (88.6\
    \ cm) and total biomass (60.3g). Prunus africana had the least growth performances.\
    \ Markhmia had the maximum rate of transpiration (12.69 gH2O/s/m2), evapotranspiration\
    \ (14.20 gH2O/s/m2). Funtumia gave the best water-use efficiency (176.5 ml/g).\
    \ Their least values were observed in P. Africana. Funtumia africana had the best\
    \ water use efficiency while Markhmia tomentosa had the best root development.\
    \ These two species would be suitable for the afforestation/reforestation of water\
    \ catchment areas in Cameroon at low altitude while P. africana, naturally adapted\
    \ to high altitudes require further investigations.</em>"
