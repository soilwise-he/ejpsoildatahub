  title: Design and Application of Trenchless Drill Rig Manipulator for Automatic
    Drill Pipe Loading and Unloading from the Soil
  abstract: "The objective of this article is to analyze the design parameters related\
    \ to a trenchless drill rig manipulator as material handling equipment for automatic\
    \ drill pipe loading and unloading from the soil. Trenchless technology was explained\
    \ using directional drilling (horizontal directional drilling) and certain criteria\
    \ for this design to be achieved were stated. This article also covered the working\
    \ principle of a trenchless rig. A great deal of literature was used to back up\
    \ this design, describing the trenchless drilling rig and the various stresses\
    \ experienced by pipelines during installation. The interaction of pipe material\
    \ with the soil was studied, and with the aid of structural mechanics\u2019 equations,\
    \ mathematical relations were formulated and used to estimate vital properties\
    \ required for subsurface construction, like the bending radius of the material\
    \ (pipe) and pullback force under a certain soil component, which aided the system\
    \ design and analysis. The findings in this article show that the principal loading\
    \ experienced by pipelines during installation and operation is bending, and the\
    \ application of a trenchless drill rig manipulator under different soil types\
    \ can help workers lift, maneuver, load, and unload heavy and large drill pipes\
    \ as it has the ability to reach into tight spaces and carry out various functions."
