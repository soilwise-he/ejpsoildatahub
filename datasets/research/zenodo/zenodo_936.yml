  title: A study on quantity/intensity parameters of soil potassium following a year
    of cropping in an alluvial and a lateritic soil of West Bengal
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krishi Viswavidyalaya. Mohanpur-741 252, Nadia, India E-mail : sarojsanyal@hotmail.com;\
    \ sarojsanyal@yahoo.co.in <em>Manuscript received 7 June 2004. revised 24 December\
    \ 2004, accepted 19 January 2005</em> In the background of the imbalance in the\
    \ use of N, P, K fertilizers, largely practised by the farmers in the alluvial\
    \ and the lateritic soils of West Bengal, especially with regard to potassic fertilizers\
    \ with the prevalent assumption that these soils are fairly rich in potash, an\
    \ experiment was conducted between April, 2001 and May, 2002, in a lateritic soil\
    \ (Midnapur) and an alluvial soil (Kalyani) of West Bengal, covering selected\
    \ cropping sequences. Relationships between the quantity (<em>Q</em>) and intensity\
    \ (<em>I</em>) parameters of labile K in the soils, initially and after one cropping\
    \ year, were examined at both these sites by following the standard methodologies.\
    \ The quantity parameters such as K<sub>L</sub>, K<sub>X</sub>, \u0394K<sub>0</sub>\
    \ and PBC<sup>K</sup> showed characteristic variations over such periods of time\
    \ in soils at both the locations. The intensity parameters, namely AR<sup>K</sup><sub>e</sub>,\
    \ also showed a similar trend. The soil with relatively higher clay content recorded\
    \ higher K<sub>x</sub> and<strong> </strong>PBC<sup>K</sup> values. Thus it can\
    \ be concluded that the present alluvial soil (Kalyani) could support better the\
    \ high intensive cropping sequences in absence of extraneous K application on\
    \ a long-term basis."
