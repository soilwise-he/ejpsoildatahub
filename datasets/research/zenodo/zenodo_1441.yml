  title: The soil mite genus Conchogneta (Acari, Oribatida, Autognetidae), with new
    findings from Mongolia
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This work deals with taxonomy, geographical distribution as
    well as known ecology of oribatid mites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Conchogneta &lt;/i&gt;Grandjean,
    1963 in the world. The majority of species belonging to this genus is known to
    be widely distributed in Europe, but only three of them are found in other areas
    of the northern hemisphere. Most species of &lt;i&gt;Conchogneta &lt;/i&gt;are
    inhabitants of litter of various types of forestas, terricolous and epiphytic
    bryophytes, epiphytic lichens, and soil of steppe, river valleys, moor, oligotrophic
    bogs, floodland assemblages etc. A new species, &lt;i&gt;Conchogneta glabrisensillata&lt;/i&gt;
    sp. n. is described, and another species, &lt;i&gt;C. traegardhi&lt;/i&gt; (Forsslund,
    1947) is redescribed from the northern and western parts of Mongolia, respectively.
    &lt;i&gt;Conchogneta&lt;/i&gt; is recorded for the first time for the fauna of
    Mongolia. The species status of &lt;i&gt;C. dalecarlica&lt;/i&gt; (Forsslund,
    1947) is discussed. Species descriptions are accompanied with detailed illustrations.
    Furthermore, a key is provided for the identification of adults of the known species
    of &lt;i&gt;Conchogneta&lt;/i&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;'
