  title: 'Soil-transmitted Helminths Infection among Primary School Students: which
    Policy bhould be Emphasized?'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil Transmitted Helminths is a neglected disease and remain
    untouched in Balikpapan despite of its deteriorating effects on child health.
    A cross-sectional study to reveal the actual infection among school-age children
    in Balikpapan was conducted from January-March 2016 involved 101 students from
    10 schools. All subjects and parents were interviewed using validated questionnaire
    followed by stool examination. All data underwent univariate and bivariate test
    using fisher exact&rsquo;s test, ANOVA and logistic regression test (95% CI).
    Rate of positive infection was 62.4%. Associated risk factors were, routine hand
    wash (p=0.004 OR=0.050), taking oral prophylaxis (p=0.001 OR=0.182), use of footwear
    (p=0.009 OR=2.529), involved in &ldquo;Young Doctor Program&rdquo; or other health
    promotion program (p=0.014 OR 0.324) and the type of toilet at home (p=0.048).
    Knowledge about worm infection (p=0.659), history of previous worm infection (p=0.768)
    and access to clean water at home (p=0.361) were insignificantly associated with
    infection rate. Community service (such as &ldquo;The Clean, Green And Healthy&rdquo;
    program) (p=0.037 OR 0.395) and Community Health Care (p=0.000 OR 0.155) were
    associated with lower risk of infection. Regression test shows that community
    health care and oral prophylaxis were the most influencing factor and these factors
    should be considered as the main focus of intervention.&lt;/p&gt;'
