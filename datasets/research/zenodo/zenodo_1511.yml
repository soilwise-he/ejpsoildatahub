  title: Production of gluconic acid by fungal species isolated from soil in Keffi,
    Nigeria
  abstract: This investigation aimed at production of gluconic acid by fungal species
    isolated from soil in Keffi. Standard microbiological methods were employed for
    isolation and identification of the fungal isolates. The yields of gluconic acid
    produced by the different isolates of the fungi were determined using gas chromatograph
    and mass Spectrometry. The occurrence of fungi showed that <em>Rhizopus oryzae</em>
    was 100%, <em>Aspergillus</em> <em>carneus</em> was 75.0%, <em>Aspergillus</em><em>
    niger </em>was 75.0% and <em>Aspergillus</em> <em>terreus </em>was 100% while
    <em>Trichoderma viride</em> was 25.0% and <em>Fusarium moniliforme </em>was 25.0%.
    The result further demonstrated that three species of the fungal isolates <em>Aspergillus</em><em>
    niger, Aspergillus</em> <em>carneus</em> and <em>Fusarium moniliforme </em>were
    found to produce gluconic acid. Screening for gluconic acid production showed
    that <em>Aspergillus</em><em> carneus</em> isolated from locations As1, Cs1 and
    Cs2, <em>Aspergillus</em> <em>niger</em> isolated from locations Bs1, Bs2 and
    Cs4 were able to produce gluconic acid. Result of effect of temperature, pH, substrate
    concentration and fermentation time on production of gluconic acid showed that
    Aspergillus <em>niger</em> Bs2 produced highest amount of gluconic acid at 28<sup>o</sup>C,
    similarly highest amount for gluconic acid produced by <em>Aspergillus</em><em>
    carneus</em> As1 was at 28<sup>o</sup>C, whereas <em>Fusarium moniliforme</em>
    Bs4 produced highest at 30<sup>O</sup>C. pH 6.5 was found to the best optima pH
    for production of both gluconic acid for the fungi studied namely <em>Aspergillus
    </em><em>niger</em> Bs2 and <em>Aspergillus carneus</em> As1 and <em>F</em><em>usarium
    moniliforme</em> Bs4 produced highest gluconic acid at pH 5.5. The substrate concentration
    showed highest production of gluconic acid was produced by <em>Aspergillus </em><em>niger</em>
    Bs2 at substrate concentration of 25%. <em>Aspergillus</em> <em>carneus</em> As1
    produced highest at substrate concentration of 20% and <em>Fusarium moniliforme</em>
    Bs4 produced highest at substrate concentration of 20%. The fermentation time
    showed highest production of gluconic acid by Aspergillus <em>niger</em> Bs2 and
    <em>Aspergillus</em> <em>carneus</em> As1 was after 144 hours whereas <em>F.</em>
    <em>moniliforme </em>Bs4 produced gluconic acid after 120hrs respectively. The
    fungi species isolated from soil in keffi revealed great ability in production
    of gluconic acid.
