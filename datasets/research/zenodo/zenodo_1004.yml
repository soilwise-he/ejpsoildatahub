  title: METHOD FOR PRODUCING STABLE GEOECOLOGICALLY STABLE SOIL MIXTURES BASED ON
    DRILLING.
  abstract: "An analysis of the scientific, technical and patent literature was carried\
    \ out, reflecting the current state of the problems of pollution of natural geosystems\
    \ by the placement of drilling waste and drill cuttings, and an analytical review\
    \ was prepared, the properties of the studied raw materials were studied, and\
    \ the research methods and methods of conducting experiments were also described.\
    \ The studies were carried out by chemical methods (atomic emission spectrometry\
    \ with inductively coupled plasma, IR spectrometry, titration, precipitation),\
    \ X-ray phase, microstructural analysis and physical and mechanical (moisture,\
    \ liquid and moisture at the rolling boundaries) methods of determination. \xAD\
    , shear ring density, pycnometric method, compression modulus) and toxicological\
    \ characteristics (biotest using methods for determining the toxicity of aqueous\
    \ extracts by changing the mortality and productivity of daphnia and changing\
    \ the level of chlorophyll fluorescence. the number of algae cells). Mathematical\
    \ processing of experimental data was carried out using special software using\
    \ basic statistical methods and laws."
