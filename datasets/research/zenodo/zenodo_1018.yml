  title: Disentangling carcass size and climate effects on soil biogeochemistry during
    decomposition
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;When an animal dies the decomposition of its carcass releases\
    \ multiple compounds that become available to soil microbiota altering soil biogeochemistry.\
    \ This zone of affected substrate is characterized by significant changes to numerous\
    \ soil biogeochemical parameters including pH, conductivity, microbial respiration\
    \ rates, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), C/N ratios, carbon and nitrogen stable\
    \ isotopes (\u03B413C and&lt;em&gt;\_&lt;/em&gt;\u03B415N), and major/trace elemental\
    \ concentrations. Although the effects of animal decomposition on these parameters\
    \ have been recorded for various organisms and in a variety of ecosystems several\
    \ knowledge gaps remain, including:&lt;/p&gt;the effect of carcass size; anddecomposition\
    \ effects in prairie ecosystems (i.e., semi-arid climates).&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate\
    \ how soil biogeochemical parameters are affected by the decomposition of a horse\
    \ carcass (~660 kg) in a prairie ecosystem in comparison to beavers (~18 kg) in\
    \ a temperate forest. Three parameters were identified as significantly influenced\
    \ by carcass size: conductivity, DOC, and microbial respiration rate. Average\
    \ soil conductivity underneath the horse carcass was three to fifteen times higher\
    \ than control soils and reached a maximum at 1114 ADD, while maximum soil conductivity\
    \ values were observed after 160 ADD in beaver-associated soils. Maximum DOC concentrations\
    \ were observed after 160 ADD in beaver-associated soil (67 \xB1 40 mg C gdw-1)\
    \ and after 1114 ADD in horse-associated soil (326 \xB1 115 mg C gdw-1). Microbial\
    \ respirations rates were both greater in horse-associated soil and longer-lasting\
    \ compared to beaver-associated soil. Respiration rates were greatest in two of\
    \ the three horse-associated soils after 1114 ADD (~733\_\xB5g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C\
    \ gdw-1\_day-1), which significantly differs compared to beaver-associated soils\
    \ (300 \xB1 90\_\xB5g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C gdw-1\_day-1\_at 160 ADD).\
    \ Taken together, these results demonstrate that larger carcasses result in a\
    \ greater release of decomposition products, including C, and greater stimulation\
    \ of soil heterotrophic communities. Other measured biogeochemical indicators\
    \ of decay suggest a mixed influence due to carcass size and climate, notably\_\
    \u03B415N values of the soil, and major element concentrations. Climate was revealed\
    \ to be more important in controlling changes to pH and gravimetric moisture than\
    \ carcass size, with baseline soil conditions and type playing critical roles.\
    \ Additionally, in semi-arid regions such as western South Dakota, the role of\
    \ wet-dry cycles on carcasses undergoing decomposition may help to explain the\
    \ pulses observed with C concentrations\_and C cycling. This study provides the\
    \ first direct comparison of soil biogeochemistry associated with the decomposition\
    \ of two different sized taxa decayed in two different climates. Attempting to\
    \ normalize climate data using ADD was found to be an imperfect system that does\
    \ not account for all climate variables affecting decomposition. Unravelling patterns\
    \ in decomposition can better help to constrain nutrient cycling in modern and\
    \ ancient ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;"
