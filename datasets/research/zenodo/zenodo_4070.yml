  title: Characterization of a Commercial Grade Humic Acid (HA) and Its Impact on
    Soil Properties and the Yield of Maize
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted at the Prince Audu Abubakar University Research
    and Demonstration Farm, Anyigba, during the 2020 farming season. The broad objective
    of this research was to determine the effect of humic acid (HA) on soil properties,
    growth and yield of maize in southern guinea savannah. The parameters measured
    includes, plant height (cm), number of leaves, stem girth (cm),&nbsp; fresh cob
    weight (g), dry cob weight (g), fresh biomass (g), dry biomass (g), cob length
    (cm) cob diameter(cm), 100 grains weight (g) and total yield (kg). The experiment
    had eight (8) treatments (T1 = Control, T2 = HA10, T3= HA20, T4= HA30, T5= RNPK,
    T6= 1/3RNPK+HA30, T7= 1/2RNPK+HA30 and 2/3RNPK+HA30) which were replicated three
    (3) times and the experimental design was randomized complete block design (RCBD).&nbsp;
    From the result obtained, the HA concentrate has high pH (10.07), high in carbon
    (36.48) and high HA percentage (92.00). Pre-cropping soil analyses confirm the
    soil to be acidic (4.85), low in nutrient and the textural class is sand. Post-cropping
    soil analyses showed HA10 helped reduce soil pH the most (5.22) and application
    of HA generally help increase the concentration of micronutrients.&nbsp; The application
    of HA on maize had no significant (p&lt;0.05) influence on the plant height, number
    of leaves, stem girth and most of the yield parameters tested with the exception
    of 100grain weight and total yield. Treatment 2/3RNPK+HA30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    had a seed weight (21.50) which is statistically same with treatment RNPK (21.67).The
    total yield of maize gotten in this study showed that treatment HA10 had the highest
    yield (2.93) after treatment RNPK (3.53).Therefore, long term studies are required
    in the study location to know if positive responses will be observed on soil properties
    and growth of crops with the application of HA.&lt;/p&gt;'
