  title: 'Novel Ecofriendly Approaches for Controlling Soil Borne Fungal Pathogens:
    A Review'
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract\u2014</strong> The application of chemical fungicides\
    \ for controlling soil borne plant pathogens is rapidly increasing due to their\
    \ potential to deliver desirable results in a short span of time. However their\
    \ rampant use has made many invasive plant pathogens resistant to any chemical\
    \ control making them way harder to eradicate or eliminate as compared to the\
    \ past days. The uncontrolled use of chemical fungicides is also causing soil\
    \ toxicity and water pollution leading to several health hazards. The aim of the\
    \ review article is to highlight the recent advancements in the field of eco-friendly\
    \ disease management using the extracts obtained from natural resources and biologically\
    \ active antagonistic organisms. The review article highlights the management\
    \ of Black scurf disease (Rhizoctonia solani) in Potato using Bacillus subtilis\
    \ V26 strain and by using a mixture of cattle manure and date palm compost. Biological\
    \ control of Fusarium wilt of tomato (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici) by\
    \ the application of endophytic bacterial isolates from Silver Leaf (Solanum elaeagnifolium)\
    \ has been also mentioned. The review includes the management of Late blight of\
    \ potato (Phytophthora infestans) using antagonistic Poplar (Populus nigra) bud\
    \ extracts and peptide extracts obtained from Common Horsetail (Equisetum arvense).\
    \ The review article also mentions the innovative method of management of Black\
    \ shank disease of tobacco (Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae) by colonization\
    \ of tobacco roots with Paenibacillus polymyxa C5 strain. As per the article,\
    \ Foot rot of rice or rice bakanae (Fusarium moniliforme) can be effectively managed\
    \ by the application of antifungal Surfactin-A extracted from Bacillus subtilis\
    \ NH-100 and NH-217 strains. The article highlights the potential of the Bacillus\
    \ subtilis RH5 strain as a bioformulation for controlling Sheath blight of rice\
    \ (Rhizoctonia solani). The extracts and the antagonistic biocontrol agents can\
    \ be used in the effective management of some economically important soil-borne\
    \ plant diseases as a novel, innovative and environmentally safe approach."
