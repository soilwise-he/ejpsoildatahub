  title: "EFFECT OF DIFFERENT HEAVY METALS ON \u03B1-AMYLASE ACTIVITY ISOLATED FROM\
    \ COWPEA (Vigna unguiculata (L.) WALP.) GROWN ON CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM KACHIA\
    \ LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KADUNA STATE, NIGERIA"
  abstract: "ABSTRACT <em>Recently, heavy metals reaching food crops is becoming the\
    \ world concerns and their effect on humans. To avoid this, plants are used to\
    \ reduce certain contamination of heavy metals. In this paper, heavy metal concentrations\
    \ and alpha-amylase activity in plants grown on the contaminated soil was investigated.\
    \ </em><em>The objectives of the study were; to evaluate heavy metal concentrations\
    \ in cowpea plant grown on contaminated soils, to extract and characterize Alpha\
    \ amylase from the plant. Soil and cowpea plant samples obtained from polluted\
    \ and unpolluted (control) area, as well as cowpea seed variety samples (7) obtained\
    \ from IAR ABU Zaria, were digested and analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer\
    \ (AAS). The alpha-amylase activity was also determined using a conventional method.\
    \ Correlation analysis was also done among heavy metals in the soil and the leaves.\
    \ Michaelis constants (Km) and maximal rates of substrate hydrolysis (Vmax) were\
    \ determined </em><em>Using Lineweaver-Burke plot. The plants grown on contaminated\
    \ soil </em><em>showed synergistic effect on the removal of </em><em>Pb 109 </em><em>mg/ml\
    \ and </em><em>Fe 49.5 mg/ml</em><em>. The result of the correlation analysis\
    \ for Cu, Pb and Fe showed positive relationships among th</em><em>ese heavy metals\
    \ in both contaminated and uncontaminated soils while Zn showed a negative correlation.\
    \ The activity of the enzyme 30.0 \xB5mole/min was found to be higher in seeds\
    \ when compared with other samples. The enzyme optimum pH showed mixed activity\
    \ due to iso-enzymes. The optimum temperature 60<sup>0</sup>C produced activity\
    \ of 10 \xB5mole/min. The results imply that, plants growing in the vicinity of\
    \ land used for military activities may pose some negative effect on the alpha-amylase\
    \ activity and may affect the food chain. </em> <strong>Keywords</strong><strong>:\
