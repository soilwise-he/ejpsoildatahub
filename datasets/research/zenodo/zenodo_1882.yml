  title: Intelligent IoT based soil monitoring and irrigation system using fuzzy logic
    control and Nodemcuesp8266 Microcontroller
  abstract: Internet of things (IoT), a well-known branch of computer science that
    has introduced intelligent farming to green agriculture. IoT depicts a self-configuring
    chain of components. The efficient implementation helps agriculture, a self- discipline
    as nicely as thriving for quality, increased yield and reduced human work. Development
    of irrigated agriculture has become one of the most reliable strategies of increasing
    world food supply in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for food by the
    increasingly complex and expanding global population of Homo sapiens. In areas
    of little rainfall, full-scale irrigation is practices, but some of these irrigation
    methods are not very efficient thus causing farmers to lose about 50% of water
    supplied. The study is aim at evaluating environmental parameters such as soil
    moisture, temperature and humidity while using the acquired data to develop an
    effective intelligent IoT based automated soil monitoring and irrigation system.
    These data are stored to the IoT Thing-Speak platform in order to analyze past
    conditions of plants and to predict their performance. Using the moisture sensor
    and the NodeMCUESP8266 microprocessor, this procedure will continue until the
    ideal moisture level is reached. Environmental conditions are monitored using
    temperature and humidity sensors. An intelligent IoT based automated soil monitoring
    and irrigation system get real-time data, increase the crop performance and reduce
    the water that is lost in the irrigation process, also reduce the time spent on
    the field.
