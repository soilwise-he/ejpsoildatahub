  title: Assessment of the adaptive potential of spring rapeseed varieties (Brassica
    napus L.) in different soil and climatic zones of Ukraine
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;To study the stability
    and plasticity of spring rapeseed varieties, in order to assess their adaptability
    potential in the Steppe, Forest-Steppe and Polissia zones, and also select the
    most ecologically plastic varieties among them.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Field, laboratory, analytical
    and statistical.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Seven varieties of spring
    rapeseed, included in the State Register of Plant Varieties suitable for dissemination
    in Ukraine, were studied on indicators of plasticity and stability of yield traits,
    weight of 1000 seeds, protein and oil content. The highly plastic intensive varieties
    &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo;, &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo;
    were selected for yield among the studied varieties, which are able to respond
    appropriately to changing of growing conditions. Varieties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo; belong to intensive varieties for the parameter
    of weight of 1000 seeds. The variety &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo; was also highly plastic
    for this parameter. The varieties &lsquo;Axana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bilder&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;CLICK&nbsp;CL&rsquo;, according to their protein content, belong to the
    intensive type varieties that are capable of combining sufficiently high valu&shy;es
    of the studied parameter with its stability under changing conditions. Variety
    &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo;, which was low-plastic, has a rather low positive
    value of the average group deviation of the reaction stability coefficient, therefore,
    it can be attributed to widely adapted genotypes. Varieties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7175&nbsp;CL&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sander&rsquo; belong to highly plastic
    intensive varieties in oil content. Varieties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7175&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;Builder&rsquo; and &lsquo;CLICK&nbsp;CL&rsquo; are showed high stability
    for yield, varieties &lsquo;Axana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo; and &lsquo;CLICK&nbsp;CL&rsquo;
    for weight of 1000 seeds. The varie&shy;ties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7175&nbsp;CL&rsquo;, &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo;
    were highly stable in protein content, in oil content &ndash; varieties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;Axana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Builder&rsquo; and &lsquo;CLICK&nbsp;CL&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;. It were established that high-intensity
    varieties for yield and weight of 1000 seeds in the Steppe, Forest-Steppe and
    Polissia zones are &lsquo;DC&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo; and &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7150&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    for protein content &ndash; varieties &lsquo;Axana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Builder&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;CLICK&nbsp;CL&rsquo;, for oil content &ndash; varieties &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7160&nbsp;CL&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;DK&nbsp;7175&nbsp;CL&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sunder&rsquo;. The evaluation of
    the plasticity and stability of rapeseed varieties, which were included in the
    State register of plant varieties suitable for dissemination in Ukraine, makes
    it possible to select varieties that belong to the intensive type. According to
    the research results, varieties which are able to successfully adapt to the limiting
    environmental factors and stress in various soil and climatic zones have been
    selected.&lt;/p&gt;'
