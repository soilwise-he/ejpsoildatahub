  title: Isolation and Identification of Microorganisms from Soil Enriched With Different
    Fertilizers in Field Cultivation with Rice
  abstract: "<em>Microorganisms are able to convert fertilizers that contain nitrogen,\
    \ phosphorous, potassium and minerals in the soil for their growth. Seven samples\
    \ (Control, PU, GU+P&amp;K, PU+P&amp;K, GU+P&amp;K+FYM, PU+P&amp;K+FYM) of the\
    \ post-planting soil of rice used for isolation and identification of bacteria\
    \ and fungi. A total of five bacterial species were isolated from the experimental\
    \ plots which include Dipiobacillus species, Streptococcus species, Streptobacillus\
    \ species, Coccobaccillus species and Staphylococus species. Bacteria isolated\
    \ were mainly rod and cocci in shape. Dipiobacillus spp and Streptobacillus spp\
    \ have single arrangement and is Gram negative. Streptococcus spp and Coccobacillus\
    \ spp have chain arrangement and is Gram positive. Staphylococcus spp are cluster\
    \ in arrangement and is Gram positive. Total viable colony counts of the bacterial\
    \ isolates ranged from 1.04 x 103 \u2013 9.60 x 103 and 1.40 x 105 \u2013 8.00\
    \ x 105. A total of thirteen genera of fungi were isolated from plots treated\
    \ with different fertilizers. The majority of isolates were members of the genus\
    \ Phoma. The combination of inorganic and organic fertilizers significantly (p&lt;0.05)\
    \ increased fungal counts over control (8.0x105) The control (zero application)\
    \ had lower isolates due to no (fertilizer application) to the soil. The combination\
    \ of inorganic and organic fertilizers significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased fungal\
    \ counts over control (8.0x105).</em>"
