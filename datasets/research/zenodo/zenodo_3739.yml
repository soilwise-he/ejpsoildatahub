  title: EFFECT OF TALL FESCUE ENDOPHYTE STRAINS AND NITROGEN FERTILIZATION ON SOIL
    AGGREGATE STABILITY
  abstract: "Recently, it has been reported that the infection of tall fescue with\
    \ Neotyphodium spp. endophytes may induce changes in host grass physiology, especially\
    \ in root morphology that could affect soil aggregate stability. Therefore, the\
    \ effects of N management under stockpiled \"Jesup\" tall fescue (Schedonorus\
    \ phoenix) infected with and without different endophytes (Neotyphodium coenophialum)\
    \ on short-term response of aggregate stability in a Marietta loam soil (Fine-loamy,\
    \ siliceous, active, thermic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts) was investigated. The experimental\
    \ design was split-split block replicated four times. Endophyte strains in tall\
    \ fescue evaluated were: endophyte-infected wild type (E+), novel endophyte infected\
    \ (E502, E514, E542, and E584) and endophyte free (E-). Nitrogen treatment consisted\
    \ of a control and two N sources [urea and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)] applied\
    \ at two different rates (56 or 112 kg ha-1 of actual N) applied in mid-September\
    \ and mid-October. Aggregate stability was measured as water stable macro-aggregate\
    \ (&gt;250 \xB5m) and micro-aggregate (125-250 \xB5m) using a wet sieving apparatus.\
    \ Endophytes in tall fescue did not affect macro-aggregates, but did affect micro-aggregates.\
    \ Stable micro-aggregates decreased in following order E584 &gt; E502 &gt; E+\
    \ &gt; E514 &gt; E- &gt; E542. The application of nitrogen fertilizer in September\
    \ increased macro-aggregates by 4% and decreased micro-aggregates in the soil\
    \ by 8% when applied as ammonium nitrate in comparison to urea. In contrast, application\
    \ of N fertilizer in October increased micro-aggregates by 5% applied as ammonium\
    \ nitrate in comparison to urea, but had no effect on macro-aggregates. These\
    \ results indicate that the direction and magnitude of the change in stable aggregates\
    \ in a soil could be influenced by the effect of management, climatic and biological\
    \ factors on the wetting and drying cycle in the soil. Future studies are needed\
    \ to determine if the effect of N fertilizer on aggregation could be attributed\
    \ to the effect of the biomass yield on the soil moisture content at rewetting.Read\
