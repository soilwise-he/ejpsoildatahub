  title: Impacts of soil carbon sequestration on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
    in Midwestern USA beef finishing systems
  abstract: "Beef cattle have been identified as the largest livestock-sector contributor\
    \ to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nUsing life cycle analysis (LCA), several\
    \ studies have concluded that grass-finished beef systems have greater GHG\nintensities\
    \ than feedlot-finished (FL) beef systems. These studies evaluated only one grazing\
    \ management system\n\u2013 continuous grazing \u2013 and assumed steady-state\
    \ soil carbon (C), to model the grass-finishing environmental\nimpact. However,\
    \ by managing for more optimal forage growth and recovery, adaptive multi-paddock\
    \ (AMP)\ngrazing can improve animal and forage productivity, potentially sequestering\
    \ more soil organic carbon (SOC)\nthan continuous grazing. To examine impacts\
    \ of AMP grazing and related SOC sequestration on net GHG\nemissions, a comparative\
    \ LCA was performed of two different beef finishing systems in the Upper Midwest,\
    \ USA:\nAMP grazing and FL. We used on-farm data collected from the Michigan State\
    \ University Lake City\nAgBioResearch Center for AMP grazing. Impact scope included\
    \ GHG emissions from enteric methane, feed\nproduction and mineral supplement\
    \ manufacture, manure, and on-farm energy use and transportation, as well as\n\
    the potential C sink arising from SOC sequestration. Across-farm SOC data showed\
    \ a 4-year C sequestration rate\nof 3.59 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121 in AMP grazed\
    \ pastures. After including SOC in the GHG footprint estimates, finishing\nemissions\
    \ from the AMP system were reduced from 9.62 to \u22126.65 kg CO2-e kg carcass\
    \ weight (CW)\u22121\n, whereas\nFL emissions increased slightly from 6.09 to\
    \ 6.12 kg CO2-e kg CW\u22121 due to soil erosion. This indicates that AMP\ngrazing\
    \ has the potential to offset GHG emissions through soil C sequestration, and\
    \ therefore the finishing phase\ncould be a net C sink. However, FL production\
    \ required only half as much land as AMP grazing. While the SOC\nsequestration\
    \ rates measured here were relatively high, lower rates would still reduce the\
    \ AMP emissions relative to the FL emissions. This research suggests that AMP\
    \ grazing can contribute to climate change mitigation\nthrough SOC sequestration\
    \ and challenges existing conclusions that only feedlot-intensification reduces\
    \ the\noverall beef GHG footprint through greater productivity"
