  title: Estimation of carrying capacity of metallic corrugated structures of the
    type Multiplate MP 150 during interaction with backfill soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;We estimated the stressed state of a railroad structure with
    a large cross section spanning more than 6 m, which is made from metallic corrugated
    sheets of the type Multiplate&nbsp;MP&nbsp;150. The stressed-strained state of
    the corrugated structure was estimated depending on the residual deformation of
    vertical diameter of the pipe, the modulus of elasticity of backfill soil, and
    the degree of compaction. The study conducted has demonstrated that maximum stresses
    occur on the horizontal sides of a metallic pipe, and maximum deformations &ndash;
    in the pipe vault.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;It was established that an increase in the degree of compaction of backfill
    soil leads to a decrease in the stresses in a metallic pipe by almost half. The
    stresses grow much faster with an increase in irregularity on the railroad track.
    Numerical calculations have shown that the equivalent stresses exceed the permissible
    magnitude of 235&nbsp;MPa when the degree of compaction of backfill soil is below
    90&nbsp;% and an operational irregularity on the track develops beyond the permissible
    magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Operational observations have shown that the pipe is most vulnerable,
    in terms of resistance against the formation of a plastic hinge, in the initial
    period of operation when the backfill soil has not yet reached the standard compaction.
    At the initial stage of operation of a metallic corrugated pipe it is necessary
    to improve the level of technological control in order to timely detect railroad
    track&rsquo;s irregularities that exceed the standards, and to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Under normal operational conditions, a metallic corrugated structure
    has a rather large reserve of carrying capacity, which amounts to 80&nbsp;%. However,
    these structures, despite their high initial strength margin, are very sensitive
    to an increase in external dynamic loads due to the occurrence of irregularity
    on the railroad track&lt;/p&gt;'
