  title: 'Multi-Soil-Layering Technology: A New Approach to Remove Microcystis aeruginosa
    and Microcystins from Water'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Eutrophication of surface waters caused by toxic cyanobacteria
    such as Microcystis aeruginosa leads to the release of secondary metabolites called
    Microcystins (MCs), which are heptapeptides with adverse effects on soil microbiota,
    plants, animals, and human health. Therefore, to avoid succumbing to the negative
    effects of these cyanotoxins, various remediation approaches have been considered.
    These techniques involve expensive physico-chemical processes because of the specialized
    equipment and facilities required. Thus, implementing eco-technologies capable
    of handling this problem has become necessary. Indeed, multi-soil-layering (MSL)
    technology can essentially meet this requirement. This system requires little
    space, needs simple maintenance, and has energy-free operation and high durability
    (20 years). The performance of the system is such that it can remove 1.16 to 4.47
    log10 units of fecal contamination from the water, 98% of suspended solids (SS),
    92% of biological oxygen demand (BOD), 98% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 92%
    of total nitrogen (TN), and 100% of total phosphorus (TP). The only reported use
    of the system to remove cyanotoxins has shown a 99% removal rate of MC-LR. However,
    the mechanisms involved in removing this toxin from the water are not fully understood.
    This paper proposes reviewing the principal methods employed in conventional water
    treatment and other technologies to eliminate MCs from the water. We also describe
    the principles of operation of MSL systems and compare the performance of this
    technology with others, highlighting some advantages of this technology in removing
    MCs. Overall, the combination of multiple processes (physico-chemical and biological)
    makes MSL technology a good choice of cyanobacterial contamination treatment system
    that is applicable in real-life conditions, especially in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;'
