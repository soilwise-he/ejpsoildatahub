  title: "Carbon Sequestration Potential of Shea Trees (Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn.)\
    \ in Parklands under Two Soil Types (Ferralsol and Cambisol) in Northern C\xF4\
    te d'Ivoire"
  abstract: "This study was conducted to assess carbon sequestration potential of\
    \ shea trees in four shea parks in Northern C\xF4te d'Ivoire to fight against\
    \ climate change. The methodology used consisted in the delimitation of 2 ha of\
    \ plot in shea parkland located in Ferk\xE9ss\xE9dougou, Ouangolodougou, Boundiali\
    \ and Tengrela. On each plot delimited within these parklands, forests inventories\
    \ were carried out and stem diameter at 1.30 m aboveground (DBH \u2265 5 cm) of\
    \ the shea trees were measured. The dendrometric data collected made it possible\
    \ to elaborate the structure of the shea trees in parkland, to estimate the biomass\
    \ and the stocks of sequestered carbon. The results showed that shea populations,\
    \ irrespective of the study site, showed a \"reversed J\" diameter distribution\
    \ with decreasing individuals. The spatial distribution of the population of shea\
    \ trees in Boundiali and Ferk\xE9ss\xE9dougou parklands is regular while it is\
    \ aggregative in Ouangolodougou and Tengrela parklands. The spatial distribution\
    \ of shea trees depends on the type of soils. Of all the sites that are mostly\
    \ bushy savannas, sequestered CO2 equivalents are high: 70.83 t.ha-1 at Boundiali,\
    \ 49.47 t.ha-1 at Ferk\xE9ss\xE9dougou, 215 t.ha-1 at Ouangolodougou and 130 t.ha-1\
    \ at Tengrela. This study shows that agroforestry is to be promoted in Northern\
    \ C\xF4te d'Ivoire through the protection of shea tree parklands that limit greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions in the atmosphere, especially in Northern C\xF4te d'Ivoire. This\
    \ will certainly facilitate C\xF4te d'Ivoire's access to the carbon market.Read\
