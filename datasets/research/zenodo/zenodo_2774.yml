  title: The Study Of Plantation In Upgrated Saline Soil By Faretima Species In Saline
    Area Badopal In District Hanumangarh, Rajasthan, India
  abstract: Vermicompost is to full fill the high demand in agriculture field without
    using chemical fertilizer. There is challenging condition to grow plant in saline
    soil area of Badopal in Hanumangarh. In present research, The Allium stivum, Triticum
    aestivum, and Brassica juncea were studies by using 30%vermicompost and10% coal
    ash in saline soil for agriculture improvement.  The height parameter of crops
    was gradually measured initially with time to upgrade of saline soil. This technique
    may be useful to induce the cultivation in saline soil area.
