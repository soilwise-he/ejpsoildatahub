  title: "Efficient, large\u2010scale archaeological prospection using a true three\u2010\
    dimensional ground\u2010penetrating Radar Array system"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Archaeological sites can be discovered and recorded in a high-resolution
    and non-invasive manner using geophysical methods. These measure the spatial variation
    of a range of physical properties of the soil which may be representative proxies
    of the subsurface archaeology. Less-invasive and cost-effective field procedures
    have become top-priority to mitigate the destructive effects on our cultural heritage
    from intensified land use, climate change and the current conflict panorama.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;At a time when many organisations are investing in advanced geophysical
    equipment, a major problem is that our ability to fully interpret the information
    available from geophysical datasets is still very limited. This deficiency prevents
    geophysical survey moving beyond basic prospection and becoming a significant
    tool for answering nuanced questions about archaeology and their host landscapes.
    This limitation arises from an incomplete understanding of the relationship between
    soil properties and geophysical measurements. Bridging this gap requires multi-disciplinary
    teams, testing novel methods, plus scholarly discussion to collate the outcomes
    of projects on this topic. Overcoming these challenges is a prerequisite for maximising
    the costeffectiveness of geophysical methods, realising the expected benefits
    of technological investment and allowing broader utility of geophysical methods
    in the cultural heritage sector.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;SAGA will build an international network of geophysicists, archaeologists,
    soil scientists and other experts to develop our capability to interpret geophysical
    data and promote research collaborations. Our vision is that after four years,
    SAGA will have created an environment within which emerging field procedures,
    enhanced data interpretation and a broader understanding of integrated geophysical
    methods can flourish.&lt;/p&gt;'
