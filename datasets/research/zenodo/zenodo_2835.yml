  title: Development of novel lightweight mud phuska composite using less cohesive
    soil, agricultural and rubber aggregates for roof and wall treatment
  abstract: "<strong>Introduction: </strong>The construction of an energy-efficient\
    \ building that satisfies all of the customer's requirements is in high demand\
    \ (1). The modern buildings have most severe issues with poor indoor environmental\
    \ quality, thermal comfort, and low efficiency. The current paper presents the\
    \ usefulness of crumb rubber added Mud phuska thermal insulating composites. Rubber\
    \ tire aggregates in the form of crumb rubber (through cryogenic grinding), was\
    \ added in different proportion into cement- soil mixes, along with other kind\
    \ of agricultural wastes (Wheat straw, Baggase/ Sugarcane waste). The Physico-mechanical\
    \ and thermal performance (k value) of the built composites were investigated\
    \ in this research. <strong>Methods: </strong>Local soil, OPC-43 grade cement,\
    \ Agriculture waste (wheat straw, sugarcane waste and crumb rubber powder) were\
    \ selected to develop cement stabilized mud composites. In this case, the major\
    \ task was to stabilize the less cohesive soil by adding OPC-43 cement in different\
    \ proportion, ranging from 5% to 15% by weight of soil. It was concluded that\
    \ 10% of cement was enough to stabilize soil samples. In total, 30 mix-proportions\
    \ were made by replacement and addition of wheat Straw, crumb rubber and bagasse\
    \ (Figure 1). Dry density, compressive strength and thermal behaviour was determined\
    \ after 7 and 28 days of curing. <strong>Results &amp; Discussions: </strong>Dry\
    \ density was calculated after 28 days of curing, and then density with its strength\
    \ was correlated. As per IS 3792:1987 (2); the density was directly proportional\
    \ to the k value. It was found that the sample having less water binder ratio\
    \ showed more compressive strength. Further; the mud composite blocks were compared\
    \ with brick of class III. It was also found that the result was very much support\
    \ the idea of using developed mud composites tiles over the roof of building for\
    \ providing better thermal performance. For determining the effectiveness of crumb\
    \ rubber blended mud composites tiles and bricks; two model houses were constructed.\
    \ Based on this research study, it was inferred that using mud composites tiles\
    \ over the roof, keeps the house cooler in summer during day and night. <strong>Conclusions:\
    \ </strong>After casting the cubes of size 50mm, two types of curing were performed\
    \ viz.- water curing and moist curing and observed that moist cured samples showed\
    \ good results as compared to water cured samples. The experimental observations\
    \ revealed that the mix proportion with ratio of crumb rubber and wheat straw\
    \ in soil and cement mix up to 7.5%, has achieved the desired value of compressive\
    \ strength (2.65 MPa) and k value (0.25 W/m.K). It was discovered that house with\
    \ cement stabilized mud composites (masonry blocks and tiles) was cooler than\
    \ the traditional model house, with an average temperature difference of 4-6<sup>0</sup>\
