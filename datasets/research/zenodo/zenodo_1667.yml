  title: Application of a Soil Quality Index to a Mediterranean Mountain with Post-Fire
    Treatments
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In Mediterranean areas, fire has increased soil degradation
    and erosion. For this reason,&lt;br&gt;the application of soil quality indices
    can help to determine soil recovery and degradation levels. By&lt;br&gt;using
    a multiparameter soil quality index fitted to undisturbed forest soils, we can
    show the right&lt;br&gt;information on soil functionality. In this study, the
    objectives were to evaluate soil functionality after&lt;br&gt;suffering a fire,
    to subsequently treat with various soil treatments (wood mulching), and then check&lt;br&gt;a
    soil quality index (SQI) to assess the soil quality recovery in burned Pinus nigra
    stands. For this&lt;br&gt;purpose, a burned area was selected in the Cuenca Mountain
    range (Spain) under a Mediterranean&lt;br&gt;climate. Experimental plots were
    established in the study area, with three slope gradients and&lt;br&gt;applying
    three methods of covering soil using: (1) wood chips; (2) piles of branches; and
    (3) trunks of&lt;br&gt;contour-felled logs. The experiment was conducted for 4
    years. Results showed that the properties of&lt;br&gt;soil were enhanced under
    wood chips and logs as a surface-covering material, and in a short time&lt;br&gt;(less
    of 3 years). In consequence, the values of the SQI index were higher after applying
    these two&lt;br&gt;treatments, thus reflecting the effectiveness of the SQI for
    monitoring post-fire recovery.&lt;/p&gt;'
