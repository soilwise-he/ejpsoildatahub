  title: Improvement of Geotechnical Properties of Expansive Soil by Lime and Polypropylene
    Fiber Material
  abstract: Improvement of the Geotechnical properties<br> of expansive soils by mixing
    Lime and<br> Polypropylene Fibers is the main<br> concentration of this research.
    For this<br> research purpose, expansive soil samples were<br> collected from
    the North-East part of Dhaka.<br> The soil has been proved to be expansive<br>
    (Plasticity Index, Plastic Limit, Liquid Limit,<br> Swelling Pressure, Swell Index,
    and Swelling<br> Potential). In this study, polypropylene fibers<br> and lime
    were used with soil to observe its<br> effect on the strength and swelling properties<br>
    of expansive soil. The soil sample was<br> formulated with 2.5% to 10% lime by
    the<br> weight of soil and 2% polypropylene fiber<br> was mixed with soil. Compared
    with the raw<br> sample with swelling properties of the<br> stabilized samples
    decreases in the beginning<br> when lime content up to 7.5%, then it<br> increased.
    Polypropylene fiber was used to<br> reduce the axial and lateral expansion of
    this<br> soil. The results show that the untrained<br> shear strength and unconfined
    compressive<br> strength of improved samples with the<br> addition of lime and
    fiber concentration is<br> substantially higher than the unimproved<br> samples.
    Whereas, axial compression<br> decreases finally, it may be said that the<br>
    stabilization of expansive soils with lime and<br> polypropylene fiber could be
    a practicable<br> method.
