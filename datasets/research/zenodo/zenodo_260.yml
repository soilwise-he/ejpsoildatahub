  title: Tomato Cultivation in Different Soil Covers
  abstract: '<em>Moving towards sustainability is a trend in agriculture today. Changing
    agricultural production systems based on traditional techniques is a necessity,
    mainly due to the growing concern with environmental and product quality. Thus,
    the aim of this study was to evaluate the different soil cover in tomato cultivation.
    The coverings studied were arranged in a randomized block design, with 4 coverings,
    being the coverings used: live covering (forage peanut), mulch (crotalaria straw
    and millet), mulching and without mulch/hoeing. Plant height, number of leaves
    and stem diameter were evaluated up to 30 days after transplanting (DAT). At 30
    DAT, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were evaluated. The harvest
    was carried out manually, and the fresh fruit mass, the number of fruits per plant-1
    and the color parameters (a*, b* and L*) were evaluated. The white plastic cover
    was superior to the other soil covers, where plants with larger stem diameter,
    a greater number of fruits per plant and fruits with less yellow pericarp color
    were observed.</em>'
