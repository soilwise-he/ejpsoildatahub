  title: Assessment of significant metals in effluents, soil, and pond water of tanneries
    south of capital of Sudan state
  abstract: 'In the present study, impact of tannery effluents and their subsequent
    on accumulation of some metals (Ca, K, Na, Mg, Cl, S, Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn)
    in water and soil samples in and around South Khartoum industrial area, Khartoum-Sudan
    were studied. Concentration of metals in tannery effluents (SA), adjacent contaminated
    pond water (SB), Soil (SC), and uncontaminated water (SD) were assessed by atomic
    absorption photometer. The results showed high levels of Ca, K, Na, Mg, Cl, S,
    Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn within the water from all sampling point (SA, SB and SC).
    The investigation exhibited that tanneries wastewater has high mean concentrations
    of Cr, Fe, Mn, and Pb in all sampling point of effluent, pond water, soil, and
    uncontaminated water, except Zn which is high only in soil sampling point (SC).
    The significant metals accumulation displayed a pattern of mean concentration
    as follow: Soil &gt; Effluent &gt;contaminated pond water &gt; Un contaminated
    water. Significant metals toxicity levels within the totally different sampling
    points were compared with water from WHO. Mean metal concentrations in un contaminated
    water were among the allowable limit set by WHO except for Magnesium (Mg). The
    comparison indicated that soil (SC) within the neighboring industrial area accumulated
    metals, enhanced levels of toxic of metals such as Cr, Ni, Zn and Pb, which also
    demonstrated higher concentration levels in the adjacent contaminated pond water
    samples. increased levels of poisonous, that additionally incontestable higher
    concentration levels within the contaminated pond water.'
