  title: Application of Mycorrhiza and Soil from a Permaculture System Improved Phosphorus
    Acquisition in Naranjilla
  abstract: Naranjilla (Solanum quitoense) is a perennial shrub plant mainly cultivated
    in Ecuador, Colombia, and Central America where it represents an important cash
    crop. Current cultivation practices not only cause deforestation and large-scale
    soil degradation but also make plants highly susceptible to pests and diseases.
    The use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can offer a possibility to overcome
    these problems. AMF can act beneficially in various ways, for example by improving
    plant nutrition and growth, water relations, soil structure and stability and
    protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, the impact of AMF
    inoculation on growth and nutrition parameters of naranjilla has been assessed.
    For inoculation three European reference AMF strains (Rhizoglomus irregulare,
    Claroideoglomus claroideum, and Cetraspora helvetica) and soils originating from
    three differently managed naranjilla plantations in Ecuador (conventional, organic,
    and permaculture) have been used. This allowed for a comparison of the performance
    of exotic AMF strains (reference strains) versus native consortia contained in
    the three soils used as inocula. To study fungal communities present in the three
    soils, trap cultures have been established using naranjilla as host plant. The
    community structures of AMF and other fungi inhabiting the roots of trap cultured
    naranjilla were assessed using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. The growth
    response experiment has shown that two of the three reference AMF strains, a mixture
    of the three and soil from a permaculture site led to significantly better acquisition
    of phosphorus (up to 104%) compared to uninoculated controls. These results suggest
    that the use of AMF strains and local soils as inoculants represent a valid approach
    to improve nutrient uptake efficiency of naranjilla and consequently to reduce
    inputs of mineral fertilizers in the cultivation process. Improved phosphorus
    acquisition after inoculation with permaculture soil might have been caused by
    a higher abundance of AMF and the presence of Piriformospora indica as revealed
    by NGS. A higher frequency of AMF and enhanced root colonization rates in the
    trap cultures supplemented with permaculture soil highlight the importance of
    diverse agricultural systems for soil quality and crop production.
