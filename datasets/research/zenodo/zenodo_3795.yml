  title: Investigating the Suitability of Snail Shell Ash as Partial Replacement for
    Soil Cement Stabilization
  abstract: <em>Snail shells is a waste product which is obtained from the eating
    of a small greenish-blue marine snail, which is found in a V shaped spiral shell,
    found in many deltaic  regions. These shells are a very strong, hard material.
    These snail are found in the creeks and mudflats of the delta areas, the people
    in this area eat the edible part as sea food and dispose the shell as a waste
    product, but a large amount of these shells are still disposed of as waste and
    with disposal already constituting a problem in area where they cannot find any
    use for it, and had led to large deposits having accumulated in many places over
    the years. It is with this understanding that this experimental study seeks to
    investigate into the suitability of snail shell ash as partial replacement for
    ordinary Portland cement in concrete The engineering properties considered are
    Optimum Moisture Content, Maximum Dry Density and California Bearing Ratio. The
    changes in these properties of the soil cement with the addition of snail shell
    ash waste in different proportions were evaluated. It is observed that the above
    properties have optimally improved by adding snail shell ash waste. This study
    shows that snail shell ash can be satisfactorily used as a stabilizing agent for
    sub-grade layers and sub-base layers of a flexible pavement</em>.
