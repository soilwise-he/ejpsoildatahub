  title: Effect of preloading on soil setup effects of a soft clay through pile static
    and dynamic load tests
  abstract: Soil setup effect is a natural phenomenon where pile bearing capacity
    increases over time as a result of dissipation of<br> excess pore water pressure
    as well as soil aging. Soil setup significantly contributes to the increase in
    shaft bearing<br> capacity of prefabricated displacement piles installed in saturated
    clay. The past experiences indicate that shaft bearing<br> capacity increases
    almost linearly with the logarithm of time elapsed after the pile initial drive,
    usually quantified using<br> a dimensionless setup factor. The magnitude of setup
    factor is governed by pile geometry and type of surrounding soil.<br> To quantify
    the setup rate potential, a minimum of two field measurements of the pile ultimate
    load are required.<br> Whenever signal matching analyses are performed on pile
    dynamic load test results at end-of-drive and restrike data,<br> the variations
    of setup effects along the pile shaft can be determined.<br> The main objective
    of this paper is to evaluate the effects of over-consolidation ratio (OCR) on
    setup factor using pile<br> dynamic load tests (DLT) at end of initial drive and
    restrike as well as static load tests (SLT). For this purpose, an<br> elaborate
    field testing program was conducted at Bidboland II Gas Refinery site. The program
    consisted of DLT and<br> SLT on the prestressed spun concrete piles that have
    been driven at different locations of the site having variations of<br> OCR as
    a result of preloading under different surcharge pressures. Results indicate that
    shaft resistance has<br> considerably increased over time at the study site. The
    setup factor is affected by the over-consolidation ratio in such<br> a way that
    with increasing OCR, the setup potential has reduced. The findings of the study
    are useful in engineering<br> applications of piling in clayey deposits in which
    the time constraints of construction does not allow performance of<br> dynamic
    load tests at different time steps as well as estimating the setup factor at sites
    having over-consolidated soil.
