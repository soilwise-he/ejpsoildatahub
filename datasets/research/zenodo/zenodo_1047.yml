  title: Spatial Analysis of Soil Salinity in the Indus River Delta, Pakistan
  abstract: Soil salinization is one of the most damaging environmental problems in
    coastal areas, including Indus River Delta (IRD). Due to the reduction of flow
    in the Indus basin, saline water from the Arabian Sea is intruding into the IRD
    and has degraded the agricultural lands drastically. Focusing on the gravity of
    the problem, the present study was designed to explore the spatial distribution
    of soil salinity in the IRD. Physicochemical analysis of 375 soil samples randomly
    collected from 125 different locations within the study area was used. Analysis
    revealed that for the top 0-20cm of soil, about 66.4% of the samples had electrical
    conductivity (EC) values, and 72.8% sodium content (ESP) values higher than the
    FAO guidelines. Similarly, for soil depth of 20-40cm, 60.8% of the EC values,
    and 72% of ESP exceeded the safe limits. Finally, for 40-60cm of soil depth, 56.8%
    of the EC values and 79.2% of the ESP values were higher than the safe limits.
    Spatial analysis revealed that more than 50% of the IRD samples were affected
    by soil salinity. Reduced freshwater flow and the entry of saline water into the
    delta may likely be the causes of soil salinity in the IRD.
