  title: An Empirical Investigation into the Causes, Nature, Impact and Remedy of
    Soil Erosion in Dakingari Town, Kebbi State, Nigeria
  abstract: This research work was carried out to examine the nature of soil erosion
    menace in Dakingari town with a view to providing a remedy. Objectively, it is
    to determine the causes and the impact of this menace on socio-economic activities
    and residential structures. Five research questions were formulated to guide the
    study in line with the stated objectives of this study. Two null hypotheses were
    tested at 0.5 level of significance. The research used primary and secondary sources
    of data including structured questionnaire, interview and library research. Random
    sampling method was employed to determine the study population. It was established
    that part of the town has been affected by soil erosion mainly caused by rainfall
    and wind. The activities of human being were also found to have caused soil erosion
    including building construction, road constructions, cutting down of trees as
    well as bush clearing for farming. The erosion had made serious damages on houses
    and other structures like schools and electricity poles. The types of control
    measures adopted were stone wall, stone line, stone bonds and sand bags. Local
    Government Authority also plays vital role in assisting the victims in reducing
    the menace. It has supplied gravels and sand to the victims together with monetary
    assistance. It has also constructed culverts and drainages for the easily draining
    of surface flow during rainfall. It was however recommended that government should
    construct good drainages system and culverts for proper flowing of water during
    and after rainfall, Areas where the erosion has just started, gravels should be
    used to control such erosion to prevent the place from developing into large channels
    and Government should intensify public enlightenments campaign to educate the
    people on the danger of soil erosion and its possible control measures among others
