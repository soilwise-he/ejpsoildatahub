  title: Poultry Manure with Sulphur Increased Growth and Productivity of Rice (Oryza
    sativa L.), and Improved Soil Health for Sustainable Crop Production in Sub-Tropical
    Climate
  abstract: An experiment was conducted at the Soil Science Research Field of Hajee
    Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh during
    the period of December 2016 to April 2017 in order to investigate the effects
    of sulphur (S) and poultry manure (PM) on the growth and yield of boro rice (BRRI
    dhan29), as succeeding soil properties. Six different levels of sulphur and poultry
    manure were used as treatments <em>viz</em>., T<sub>0</sub> = 0 kg S + 0 t PM
    ha<sup>-1</sup>, T<sub>1</sub> =9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> S + 0 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>,
    T<sub>2</sub> = 6.75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> S + 1.5 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>, T<sub>3</sub>
    = 4.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> S + 3 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>, T<sub>4</sub>= 2.25 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>
    S + 4.5 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>, T<sub>5</sub>= 0 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> S + 6 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>.
    The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with four replications.
    The experimental results revealed that plant height, 1000-seeds weight, unfilled
    grain, grain yield, straw yield were significantly influenced by S and PM. The
    treatment T<sub>3</sub> produced the longest plant (91.67cm) and panicle (24.69
    cm), the maximum number of tillers (15.45) and filled grain (156.9), while the
    lowest values (83.57cm, 22.49 cm, 12.20 and 134.00, respectively) were found in
    control condition. The minimum number of unfilled grains (18.88) was recorded
    in T<sub>3</sub> treatment which was statistically different from other treatments,
    and the maximum unfilled grains (30.48) was obtained in T<sub>0</sub> treatment.
    The 1000-grain weight (23.40) was highest in T<sub>3</sub> treatment and lowest
    (21.65) in control treatment. The grain yield and straw yield of rice were significantly
    influenced with the application of S along with PM. It was found that the application
    of 4.5 kgha<sup>-1</sup> S ha<sup>-1</sup> and 4 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup>showed the
    highest grain (6.90 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) and straw yield (8.23 t ha<sup>-1</sup>)
    and harvest index (45.60%), whereas the lowest grain and straw yield was obtained
    without S and PM. Combined application of S and PM showed than sole S but sole
    application of PM also showed better results. Sole PM (T<sub>5</sub>) showed best
    results of soil properties like OM, total N, available P, and exchangeable K contents
    in the post-harvest soil which were statistically identical T<sub>3</sub> and
    T<sub>4</sub> treatments. The highest level of available S (20.69 ppm) was recorded
    at T<sub>2</sub> which was at par with T<sub>3</sub> treatment. Considering plant
    growth, yield and post-harvest soil health 4.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, S ha<sup>-1</sup>
    and 4 t PM ha<sup>-1</sup> may be suggested for the sustainable crop production.
