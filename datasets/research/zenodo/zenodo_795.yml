  title: The potential of cover crops to increase soil organic carbon storage in German
    croplands
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;Aims &lt;/strong&gt;Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of croplands
    can be enhanced by targeted management, which boosts soil fertility and contributes
    to climate change mitigation. One SOC sequestration option is adopting cover crops.
    The aim of this study was to quantify the SOC sequestration potential of cover
    crops in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods &lt;/strong&gt;We simulated SOC scenarios on 1,267
    cropland sites with site-specific management data using an SOC model ensemble
    consisting of RothC and C-TOOL. A new method was developed to estimate carbon
    input from cover crops that included the&lt;br&gt;

    effects of climate, sowing date and species on cover crop biomass production.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; The recent cover crop area could
    be tripled to 30% of arable land in Germany. This would enhance total carbon input
    by 12% and increase SOC stocks by 35 Tg within 50 years, corresponding to an annual
    increase of 0.06 Mg C ha-1, 2.5 Tg CO2&lt;br&gt;

    or 0.8 per mill of current SOC stocks in 0&ndash;30 cm depth. On sites with cover
    crops, 0.28&ndash;0.33 Mg C ha-1 a-1 would be accumulated within 50 years. Our
    simulations predicted that even if the full potential for cover crop growth were
    realised, there would still be a decline in SOC stocks in German croplands within
    50 years due to the underlining negative SOC trend.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; Cover crops alone cannot turn croplands
    from carbon sources to sinks. However, growing them reduces bare fallow periods
    and SOC losses and thus is an effective climate change mitigation strategy in
    agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;'
