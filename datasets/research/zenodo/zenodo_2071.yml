  title: Humic acid, EDDS and EDTA induced phytoremediation of cadmium contaminated
    alluvial soil by Calendula officinalis L.
  abstract: "Sheila Dhar Institute of Soil Science, Department of Chemistry, University\

    \ <em>Manuscript received online 13 May 2014, revised 13 June 2014, accepted 13\
    \ June 2014</em> The potential of <em>Calendula officinali</em>s L. for chelate\
    \ induced phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd) contaminated alluvial soil (pH 7.8)\
    \ was investigated under pot experiment. Applied Cd at 30 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup>\
    \ and EDTA at 5 mmol kg<sup>\u2013</sup>1 caused significant reduction in plant\
    \ dry biomass (29.73% and 26.69% for root and shoot, respective ly). The combinatorial\
    \ treatment T<sub>17</sub> [Cd 30 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> + 2 g kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup> humic acid (HA) + 5 mmol kg<sup>\u20131</sup> EDTA] caused maximum Cd-accumulation\
    \ in root, shoot and flower up to the extent of 115.96, 56.65 and 13.85 mg kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup>, respectively, while the results were observed at par under the combinatorial\
    \ treatment T<sub>18 </sub>[Cd 30 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> + 2 g kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup> HA+ 5 mmol kg<sup>\u20131</sup><strong> </strong>EDDS], up to the extent\
    \ of 108.42, 55.85 and 13.72 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup>, respectively. The combinatorial\
    \ treatment T<sub>12</sub> [15 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> Cd + 2 g kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup> HA and 5 mmol kg<sup>\u20131</sup> EDDS] showed maximum remediation ratio\
    \ (RR = 0.69%) among all eighteen treatments. Applied Cd (\u2265 15 mg kg<sup>\u2013\
    1</sup>) altered the chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b and carotene contents of the\
    \ plants while application of humic acid enhanced their contents by 4.2\u2013\
    7.35%, 8.24\u201313.64% and 7.04\u20138%, respectively, over non-humic acid treated\
    \ pots. The study reveals that application of EDDS is more eco-friendly than that\
    \ of EDTA either individually or in combinations. The authors conclude that <em>Calendula\
    \ officinalis</em> L. has potential to be safely grown in moderately Cd-contaminated\
    \ soils; and application of humic acid and EDDS boosts the photosynthetic pigments\
    \ of the plants, leading to enhanced clean-up of the cadmium-contaminated soil."
