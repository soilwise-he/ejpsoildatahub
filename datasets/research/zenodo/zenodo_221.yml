  title: 2D versus 3D predictive soil mapping
  abstract: 'The data here were originally posted to facilitate timely and transparent
    peer review. The final public data release with formal metadata is now available
    from at the following location: Nauman, T.W. and Duniway, M.C., 2019, Predictive
    maps of 2D and 3D surface soil properties and associated uncertainty for the Upper
    Colorado River Basin, USA: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9YBAKC2.
    Associated publication: Nauman, T. W., and Duniway, M. C., 2019, Relative prediction
    intervals reveal larger uncertainty in 3D approaches to predictive digital soil
    mapping of soil properties with legacy data: Geoderma, v. 347, p. 170-184. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.03.037
    The raster layers in this dataset are the model predictions of various soil properties
    being created as prototype maps for more quantitative natural resource management.
    They are the model outputs for the paper currently accepted in the journal Geoderma
    entitled: "Relative prediction intervals reveal larger uncertainty in 3D approaches
    to predictive digital soil mapping of soil properties with legacy data". Data
    are provided in a beta version for review purposes only. These data are preliminary
    or provisional and are subject to revision. They are being provided to meet the
    need for timely best science. The data have not received final approval by the
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and are provided on the condition that neither the
    USGS nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from
    the authorized or unauthorized use of the data. The final US Geological Survey
    data release is available online: Nauman, T.W. and Duniway, M.C., 2019, Predictive
    maps of 2D and 3D surface soil properties and associated uncertainty for the Upper
    Colorado River Basin, USA: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9YBAKC2.
    The files are named in groups of 2-4 with the .tif file being the base raster
    grid and the other fields being supporting files used by various GIS software.
    The naming convention starts with the soil property abbreviation as follows and
    association with 2D or 3D approaches as follows: SOC_00cm_logK = 2D % wt soil
    organic carbon oc_0_cm = 3D % wt soil organic carbon sand_f_vf_psa_00cm = 2D %
    fine + very fine sands sand_f_vf_psa_0_cm = 3D % fine + very fine sands ph_h2o_0_cm
    = 3D 1:1 soil pH in water ph_h2o_2D_00cm = 2D 1:1 soil pH in water EC_2D_00cm
    = 2D 1:2 water soil electrical conductivity ec_12pre_0_cm = 3D 1:2 water soil
    electrical conductivity The next abbreviation is QRF indicating that the model
    was a quantile regression forest. The end of the filename can have several different
    formats: _QRF: This is the soil property prediction raster. _QRF_95PI_h: This
    is the upper 95% Prediction Interval raster. _QRF_95PI_l: This is the lower 95%
    Prediction Interval raster. QRF_95PI_relwidth: This is the 95% relative prediction
    interval raster that normalizes the width of the prediction interval to the original
    observation set used to train the QRF model. _bt after any of the file names simply
    means that the layer was back-transformed from a layer in transformed units (e.g.
    log).'
