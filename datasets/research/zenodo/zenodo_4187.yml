  title: Yield Targeting and Integrated Plant Nutrition System to Fix Critical Levels
    of Soil Available N, P and K for Hybrid Brinjal in Inceptisols of Andhra Pradesh
  abstract: In order to maintain sustainable soil fertility for long run, the recommendations
    are made to apply sufficient fertilisers to meet both the nutrient requirements
    of the crop and to built-up the nutrient level in the soil to a critical soil
    test level over a scheduled time frame. Soil test level is sustained at, or above,
    the critical level by using fertiliser rates that should replace the nutrients
    removed by the crop. The critical level is the soil test level at which maximum
    yield is achieved. Critical soil test values for available N, P and K were low
    under IPNS treatments (NPK + FYM @ 25 t ha-1) as compared to NPK alone which in
    turn resulted in saving of NPK fertilisers. Irrespective of treatments, higher
    yield targeting resulted in higher critical levels of nutrients in soil.
