  title: "Soil Stabilization with Rubber Latex and Human Hair Fibre\u2013 An Overview\
    \ Paper"
  abstract: Soil stabilisation is a process used to increase physical, chemical and
    biological characteristics of a soil. Soil is main factor used for road constructions.
    When the characteristics of the soil are poor it can be strengthened by stabilisation.
    Numerous stabilisers can be used for soil stabilisation such as lime, Cement,
    Fly Ash, Latex, Fibres etc. Stabilisation with Natural materials is more effective
    than artificial materials. This paper deals with the review of literature on soil
    stabilization with natural stabilizing agents.
