  title: 'Reclaiming Sodium Affected Soil: The Potential of Organic Amendments'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A study was conducted to evaluate the potential of organic amendments
    in managing sodic soils for crop production. In doing this, a pot experiment was
    conducted in which saw dust biochar (SDB), palm fiber biochar (PFB), poultry manure
    biochar (PMB) and poultry manure (PM) were applied to sodic soil sampled from
    an industrial area in Cape Coast, Ghana. Gypsum amendment and a control were included
    for the purpose of comparing results. All amendments were applied at the rate
    of 4.78 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; which was the full gypsum requirement rate
    for the soil. Amended soils were incubated and weekly sampled for 6-weeks (week
    3 to 8) for laboratory analysis. Periodic watering was done to keep soils moisture
    at field capacity. From the results, organic based amendments marginally reduced
    soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC). Same amendments significantly (P = 0.05)
    increased soil Ca&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, with
    SDB registering the highest increase. The increases in the levels of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
    and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; were marginal and statistically insignificant (P
    = 0.05). PFB recorded the highest cation exchange capacity (CEC) at week 8 and
    SDB and PFB reduced soil sodicity below the minimum threshold of exchangeable
    sodium percentage (ESP) 15. All organic based amendments recorded marginal increase
    in soil organic carbon (OC) but SDB recorded the highest value for OC at week
    8. PMB released the highest amount of available P, with peak availability observed
    in week 6 Insignificant (P = 0.05) increases were also observed for soil NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-N
    and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-N. SDB and PFB recorded
    90% and 80 maize seed germination and also, 10.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
    and 8.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;dry matter yields respectively. No maize
    seed however germinated in the control and all other amendment.&lt;/p&gt;'
