  title: 'LandGIS: global soil and vegetation mapping using legacy field observations
    and state-of-the-art Machine Learning'
  abstract: "In 2018 the OpenGeoHub Foundation released a web mapping system called\
    \ \"LandGIS\" (available at https://openlandmap.org) which is envisaged as \u201C\
    an OpenStreetMap-type system\u201D for land-related environmental data. The system\
    \ hosts global, moderate to fine spatial resolution data (250m to 1km), and is\
    \ intended for eventual production and provision of farm-scale data (100 m to\
    \ 30 m) and beyond. It also comes with a basic API (https://landgisapi.opengeohub.org)\
    \ that already allows OpenGeoHub to serve business and developers. LandGIS was\
    \ produced jointly with the help of EnvirometriX Ltd (data sets / spatial prediction\
    \ framework) and GILab Ltd (web-mapping services and client development and REST\
    \ API functionality). This document outlines basic philosophy behind the OpenLandMap.org\
    \ and why do we think world needs such a system. For more info please also refer\
    \ to the Medium article \"Everybody has a right to know what's happening with\
    \ the planet: towards a global commons\"."
