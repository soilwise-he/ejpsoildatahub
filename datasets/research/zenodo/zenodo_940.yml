  title: Metal contamination in cultivated vegetables and soil receiving untreated
    industrial wastewater
  abstract: "Department of Environmental Science, The University of Burdwan, Golapbag,<br>\
    \ Burdwan-713 104, West Bengal, India<br> E-mail : banenvs@gmail.com<br> <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 16 November 2017, revised 24 January 2018, accepted 25 January 2018</em>\
    \ The present study focuses on the analysis of industrial wastewater, characterization\
    \ of agricultural<br> soil and to examine the heavy metal (Pb, Cd, Mn, Zn and\
    \ Cu) content in some selected vegetables<br> grown on agricultural land receiving\
    \ untreated wastewater. The unscientific disposal of untreated wastewater<br>\
    \ has resulted in an accumulation of heavy metals in soils which may not only\
    \ result in soil contamination,<br> but also lead to elevated metal uptake by\
    \ vegetables/crops and ultimately affect the food chain. The concentrations<br>\
    \ (mg/L) of heavy metals in the wastewater samples ranged between Pb : 0.082\u2013\
    0.279, Cd : 0.007\u2013<br> 0.098, Mn : 0.697\u20130.875, Zn : 0.595\u20130.887\
    \ and Cu : 0.362\u20130.482. Average metal concentration in untreated<br> wastewater\
    \ was in the sequence of Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Cd, wastewater irrigated\
    \ contaminated soil<br> also followed the same sequence though BCF followed the\
    \ sequence of Cd &gt; Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu. The<br> high concentration of\
    \ Cd was found in <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em> (9.865 mg/kg) with its bioconcentration\
    \ factor (BCF)<br> value (3.446) followed by <em>Pisum sativum</em> (Ave. : 9.742\
    \ mg/kg; BCF : 3.403) and <em>Spinacia oleracea</em> (Ave. :<br> 9.241 mg/kg;\
    \ BCF: 3.228). High level of metal concentrations was also observed in the other\
    \ vegetables analyzed.<br> This may be due to the accumulation of heavy metals\
    \ in the agricultural soil due to long-term irrigation.<br> The higher values\
    \ of metal concentration and BCF indicated heavy metal contamination in the wastewater<br>\
    \ irrigated site that is may creates a major threat of negative impact on human\
    \ health."
