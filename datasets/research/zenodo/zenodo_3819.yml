  title: Influence Of Compactive Efforts On Cement- Bagasse Ash Treatment Of Expansive
    Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: "A laboratory study on the influence of compactive<br>\neffort on expansive\
    \ black cotton specimens treated with up to 8%<br>\nordinary Portland cement (OPC)\
    \ admixed with up to 8% bagasse ash<br>\n(BA) by dry weight of soil and compacted\
    \ using the energies of the<br>\nstandard Proctor (SP), West African Standard\
    \ (WAS) or<br>\n\u201Cintermediate\u201D and modified Proctor (MP) were undertaken.\
    \ The<br>\nexpansive black cotton soil was classified as A-7-6 (16) or CL using<br>\n\
    the American Association of Highway and Transportation Officials<br>\n(AASHTO)\
    \ and Unified Soil Classification System (USCS),<br>\nrespectively. The 7day unconfined\
    \ compressive strength (UCS)<br>\nvalues of the natural soil for SP, WAS and MP\
    \ compactive efforts are<br>\n286, 401 and 515kN/m2 respectively, while peak values\
    \ of 1019,<br>\n1328 and 1420kN/m2 recorded at 8% OPC/ 6% BA, 8% OPC/ 2% BA<br>\n\
    and 6% OPC/ 4% BA treatments, respectively were less than the<br>\nUCS value of\
    \ 1710kN/m2 conventionally used as criterion for<br>\nadequate cement stabilization.\
    \ The soaked California bearing ratio<br>\n(CBR) values of the OPC/BA stabilized\
    \ soil increased with higher<br>\nenergy level from 2, 4 and 10% for the natural\
    \ soil to Peak values of<br>\n55, 18 and 8% were recorded at 8% OPC/4% BA 8% OPC/2%\
    \ BA<br>\nand 8% OPC/4% BA, treatments when SP, WAS and MP compactive<br>\neffort\
    \ were used, respectively. The durability of specimens was<br>\ndetermined by\
    \ immersion in water. Soils treatment at 8% OPC/ 4%<br>\nBA blend gave a value\
    \ of 50% resistance to loss in strength value<br>\nwhich is acceptable because\
    \ of the harsh test condition of 7 days<br>\nsoaking period specimens were subjected\
    \ instead of the 4 days<br>\nsoaking period that specified a minimum resistance\
    \ to loss in strength<br>\nof 80%. Finally An optimal blend of is 8% OPC/ 4% BA\
    \ is<br>\nrecommended for treatment of expansive black cotton soil for use as<br>\n\
    a sub-base material."
