  title: Residual effects of lime and sewage sludge inputs on soil fertility and tree
    and pasture production in a Pinus radiata D. Don silvopastoral system established
    in a very acidic soil
  abstract: "In Galician (Spain) silvopastoral systems, nutrient availability to the\
    \ pasture and trees can be limited by soil acidity. Liming and fertilisation with\
    \ sewage sludge could enhance the productivity of silvopastoral systems (including\
    \ understory and trees) by increasing Ca and reducing Al in the soil. This study\
    \ evaluated changes in soil chemical properties, tree growth and understory production\
    \ in test plots, both limed and unlimed, in a silvopastoral system located on\
    \ an acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don. This research compared the\
    \ effects of different doses of sewage sludge (160, 320 and 480 kg total N ha\u2212\
    1) with the effects of mineral fertilisation (8% N \u2013 24% P2O5 \u2013 16%\
    \ K2O) and no fertilisation. The initial lime applications improved soil fertility\
    \ (increasing soil pH, effective exchange capacity, and the saturation percentage\
    \ of Ca and reducing the saturation percentage of Al) more than the sewage sludge.\
    \ However, the most significant effects of sewage sludge were found over the long\
    \ term after high doses of sewage sludge were applied (480 kg total N ha\u2212\
    1). Therefore, the use of sewage sludge as a fertiliser improves both soil fertility\
    \ and the productivity of silvopastoral systems in the long term as long as an\
    \ adequate disposal of this residue is guaranteed."
