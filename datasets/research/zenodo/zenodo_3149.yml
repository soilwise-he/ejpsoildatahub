  title: Inter-kingdom networks of canola microbiome reveal Bradyrhizobium as keystone
    species and underline the importance of bulk soil in microbial studies to enhance
    canola production.
  abstract: 'The plant subterranean microbiota is of great importance for plant growth
    and health as root-associated microbes can express crucial ecological functions.
    As the microbial environment of roots is extremely diverse, identifying keystones
    microorganisms in roots, rhizosphere and bulk soil is a necessary step towards
    understanding the network of influence within the microbial community associated
    with canola roots and enhancing its beneficial elements. To extract these hots-spots
    of microbial interaction, we used inter-kingdom network analysis on the canola
    phase of a long-term cropping system diversification experiment conducted at four
    locations in the Canadian prairies. We wanted to verify if: (1) the bacterial
    and fungal microbiota of canola roots, rhizosphere and bulk soil were related
    and influenced by diversification of the crop rotation system; (2) there are common
    or specific core-fungi and bacteria in the roots, rhizosphere, and bulk soil under
    canola grown in different environments and levels of cropping system diversification;
    (3) we wanted to identify hub-taxa at inter-kingdom level that could play an important
    ecological role in the microbiota of canola. Fungi were sensitive to crop diversification
    but not bacteria. We found no core microbiota in canola roots but identified 3
    core fungi in the rhizosphere, one core fungus in the bulk soil and one core bacterium
    shared in the rhizosphere and bulk soil. We identified two bacterial and one fungal
    hub-taxa in the inter-kingdom networks of canola rhizosphere and one bacterial
    and two fungal hub-taxa in the bulk soil. Among these inter-kingdom hub-taxa,
    <em>Bradyrhizobium sp</em>. and <em>Mortierella sp.</em> are particularly influential
    on the microbial community and the plant. To our knowledge, this is the first
    time that inter-kingdom network analysis is used to identify hot spots of interactions
    in the microbial communities associated with canola.'
