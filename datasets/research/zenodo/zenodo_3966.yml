  title: First Report of the Carolina Spiral Nematode, Scutellonema brachyurus, from
    Soil of a Garden in Crete, Greece
  abstract: "Members of the genus Scutellonema can cause substantial crop losses to\
    \ ornamental and cultivated plants directly by feeding\_ectoparasitically on plant\
    \ roots (Bridge et al., 2005; Coyne et al., 2006). In May 2015, a soil sample\
    \ from a house garden from\_Heraklion city in Crete, Greece, was sent for diagnosis\
    \ of plant-parasitic nematodes. In this place, there had been cactus (Opuntia\
    \ sp.)\_plants (probably imported), which were uprooted 3 to 4 years earlier.\
    \ After that, the area was cropped with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)\_in spring\u2013\
    summer and leaf vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and chicory\
    \ (Cichorium intybus L.) in autumn\u2013winter.\_The soil was collected 1 mon\
    \ after the end of chicory crop. A population density (ca. 30 individuals/100\
    \ cm3 of soil) of spiral\_nematodes (Scutellonema sp.) was found by extracting\
    \ soil with the wet sieving and decanting method (Cobb, 1918). Morphological\_\
    and molecular analyses of females identified the species as Scutellonema brachyurus\
    \ (Steiner, 1938) Andrassy, 1958. The morphology\_of females was characterized\
    \ by a hemispherical lip region with four to six annuli, morphometric data for\
    \ 12 females were L, 640 to\_760 mm; a, 24.6 to 30.6; b, 5.8 to 7.4; c, 69.1 to\
    \ 99.3; c0.5 to 0.6; stylet, 24.5 to 27.5 mm with anterior part shorter than posterior;\
    \ and\_spermatheca nonfunctional and male absent. The morphology agreed with the\
    \ description of S. brachyurus (van den Berg et al.,\_2013). Alignment indicated\
    \ that the D2-D3 and ITS sequences (KU059494 and KU059495, respectively) showed\
    \ 99% and 100% to\_99% similarity, respectively, to other sequences of S. brachyurus\
    \ (type A) deposited in GenBank from the United States, Italy, and Korea (JX472037-JX472046,\
    \ DQ328753, FJ485643; and JX472069, JX472070, JX472071, respectively), differing\
    \ from one to six nucleotides.\_Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference\
    \ of these sequences placed the Scutellonema sp. in a highly supported (100%)\_\
    clade that included all S. brachyurus (type A) sequences deposited in GenBank\
    \ (van den Berg et al., 2013). All identification methods\_were consistent with\
    \ S. brachyurus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. brachyurus for\
    \ Greece. As the cucumbers and the leaf\_vegetables cultivated in the area were\
    \ seed planted, we consider that the nematode originated most probably from the\
    \ cactus plants\_which had been previously root ball planted. Scutellonema brachyurus\
    \ may represent a threat for ornamental and cultivated plants\_production in Crete,\
    \ Greece. The nematode has been already reported, mainly in greenhouses of six\
    \ European countries (CABI and\_EPPO, 2006). In most of these cases, it is hypothesized\
    \ that the nematode was introduced by imported plant material."
