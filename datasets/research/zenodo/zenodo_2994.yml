  title: Characterization of Soil Microbes and Viability Assessment of Liquid Microbial
    Consortium and Its Effect on the Growth and Yield of Vignaradiata L.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The present study was carried out to isolate and identify the
    bacterial and fungal species from paddy field soil at Vedharaniyam, Nagappatinam
    District, Tamilnadu, South India. The bacterial and fungal species such as Rhizobium,
    Azotobactersp and Azospirillumsp, Aspergillussp, Trichodermasp and Penicilliumsp
    respectively were isolated from paddy field soil by Serial dilution agar plating
    method. The isolated bacterial and fungal species were prepared as liquid bacterial
    and fungal consortium and separate broth cultures were also prepared by using
    specific media. The viability count was checked by using spread plate method as
    in the broth test. The effectiveness of the growth of VignaradiataL. was tested
    by using liquid biofertilizer, using different treatments. The seeds were treated
    with the prepared biofertilizers and sown in 10 pots of equal size. The seedlings
    of each pot were treated with liquid biofertilizers. The uninoculated pot was
    denoted as control. Then the morphological parameter such as height of the plant,
    number of leaves, number of flowers, shoot length, root length, number of roots
    , inter nodal length, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, root fresh weight, root
    dry weight, number of seeds, number of root nodules, number of pods and yield
    were analyzed at different intervals 30th, 45th and 60th days . Compared to all
    combined inoculation of liquid biofertilizer T4 and T9 in 60th days showed better
    response in all the parameters tested. Tamilkodi. R | Victoria. J &quot;Characterization
