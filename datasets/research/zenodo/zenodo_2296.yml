  title: Chemical Stabilization of Clayey Soil Using Blend of Calcium Carbide Residue
    and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag
  abstract: This study investigated the use of two kinds of industrial wastes Ground
    Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) and Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) in the
    stability of soil. These industrial wastes are generally dumped or thrown, which
    produce detrimental effect on the environment. The use of these wastes as soil
    stabilization improves the properties of soil which helps in various purposes
    such as designing of pavements, embankments, etc. and save the environment from
    the ill impact. The soil can be treated and stabilized well at a relatively low
    cost by using these additives. From the experimental results, it has been observed
    that various properties of soil added with these stabilizers at certain percentage
    show remarkable positive changes as compared to the natural soil obtained. The
    permeability of the soil has reduced, which states that it can be used for the
    impervious core in Embankments. In this research, GGBS and CCR were employed in
    stabilizing soils, GGBS was fixed at 20% respectively using index properties tests
    and then CCR was varied ( i.e. 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5%). Standard proctor test results
    showed general decrease in MDD values and increase in OMC values which may be
    obvious as the specific gravity of the additives is less than that of the soil.
    The value of Unconfined Compressive Strength has increased enabling increase in
    the bearing capacity of soil. The increased value of California Bearing Ratio
    in both soaked and unsoaked conditions indicates that the designing of flexible
    pavements becomes economical by reducing the thickness of base and sub-base courses.
