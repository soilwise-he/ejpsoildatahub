  title: Effect of Different Soil Amendments and season on root quality, shelf life
    and profitability of carrot (Daucus carota L.)
  abstract: '<em>The objective for the study was to determine the effect of different
    rates of soil amendment and season on root quality, shelf life and profitability
    of carrot (Daucus carota L.) production in the transitional zone of Ghana. The
    experiment was laid out in a 10 x 2 factorial with treatments arranged in Randomized
    Complete Block Design (RCBD). The factors were ten different rates of soil amendments
    and two seasons</em><em>. The soil amendments used were: control (T<sub>1</sub>),
    </em><em>5 ton/ha poultry manure </em><em>(T<sub>2</sub>), </em><em>45-45-45 kg/ha
    NPK,</em><em> (T<sub>3</sub>), </em><em>5 ton/ha compost</em><em> (T<sub>4</sub>),
    </em><em>7.5 ton/ha compost</em><em> (T<sub>5</sub>), </em><em>10 ton/ha compost</em><em>
    (T<sub>6</sub>), </em><em>50 % NPK + 2.5 ton/ha compost</em><em> (T<sub>7</sub>),
    </em><em>50 % NPK + 3.75 ton/ha compost</em><em> (T<sub>8</sub>), </em><em>50
    % NPK + 5 ton/ha compost</em><em> (T<sub>9</sub>) and </em><em>50 % NPK + 2.5
    ton/ha poultry manure </em><em>(T<sub>10</sub>). The seasons were major and minor.
    There were four replications. </em><em>All data collected were subjected to analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) using GENSTAT Version 11.1 (2008). The application of 7.5
    ton/ha compost significantly showed greatest values for beta carotene, root cracking
    and total soluble solid. The control treatment had significantly the longest shelf
    life than the amended treatments. High (P &lt; 0.05) cost of production was observed
    among carrot plants supplied with 10 ton/ha compost while the profit obtained
    was highest (P &lt; 0.05) in the application of 7.5 ton/ha compost. With respect
    to season, weight loss of carrots at 15 DAH was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher
    in the major rainy season. The minor rainy season recorded the highest levels
    of vitamin C. The highest profit margin was observed in the major rainy season.
    This study concludes that 7.5 ton/ha compost promote bigger roots, root quality
    and maximize profit.</em>'
