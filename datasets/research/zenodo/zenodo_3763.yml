  title: The Use Of Rice Husk Ash As A Stabilizing Agent In Lateritic Clay Soil
  abstract: 'Rice Husk (RH) is the major byproduct in the

    processing of paddy rice. The management of this waste has become

    a big challenge to some of the rice producers, some of these wastes

    are left in open dumps while some are burn in the open space, and

    these two actions have been contributing to environmental pollution.

    This study evaluates an alternative waste management of this

    agricultural product for use as a civil engineering material. The RH

    was burn in a controlled environment to form Rice Husk Ash (RHA).

    The RHA was mix with lateritic clay at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10%

    proportion by weight. Chemical test was conducted on the open burn

    and controlled burn RHA with the lateritic clay. Physical test such as

    particle size distribution, Atterberg limits test, and density test were

    carried out on the mix material. The chemical composition obtained

    for the RHA showed that the total percentage compositions of Fe2O3,

    SiO2 and Al2O3 were found to be above 70% (class "F" pozzolan)

    which qualifies it as a very good pozzolan. The coefficient of

    uniformity (Cu) was 8 and coefficient of curvature (Cc) was 2 for the

    soil sample. The Plasticity Index (PI) for the 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. 10% was

    21.0, 18.8, 16.7, 14.4, 12.4 and 10.7 respectively. The work

    concluded that RHA can be effectively used in hydraulic barriers and

    as a stabilizing agent in soil stabilization.'
