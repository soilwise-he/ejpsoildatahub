  title: Geospatial Analysis of Lead Concentration in the Soil of Anka, Zamfara State,
    Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders)
    reported an outbreak of lead poisoning in some parts of Zamfara State, Nigeria.
    This was alleged to have been caused by massive environmental contamination due
    to local ore processing. Most of the studies conducted on the problem so far have
    been limited to the clinical component. Analysis of the spatial dimension of the
    problem is inadequately known. The present study investigates the spatial dimension
    of lead concentration in the soil of the study area. In addition, the concentration
    of copper and cadmium which occur in association with lead was also determined
    in order to ascertain their level of toxicity, and hence their contribution to
    the degradation of the soil. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for the
    concentration of lead, copper, and cadmium. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) spatial
    interpolation technique was employed to determine the spatial distribution of
    lead, copper and cadmium concentration, while comparative analysis was employed
    to determine their toxicity. Descriptive and t-Test (inferential) statistical
    analyses were utilized to establish a relationship between local gold ore processing
    and the concentration of lead in the study area. The results show high concentration
    of lead in areas where local ore processing is taking place and low concentration
    in non-ore processing areas, while concentration of copper and cadmium were seen
    to be within thresholds of internationally accepted standards. Student t-Test
    statistics applied to lead concentration values in mining and non-mining villages
    showed that T (tabulated) at 95% confidence level 0.05 &gt; T (calculated) 0.000005.
    This implies there is a significant difference between the concentration of lead
    in mining and non-mining areas.&lt;/p&gt;'
