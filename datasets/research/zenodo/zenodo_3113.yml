  title: Determining a technique for transmitting measuring data on the spatial positioning
    of the piercing head in small-size installations during controlled soil piercing
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;For laying of underground utility systems in urban conditions\
    \ by the method of horizontally directed soil piercing, small-sized units are\
    \ designed. Such units should have measurement systems for determining the spatial\
    \ position of the piercing head. In known systems, the surface layer of the soil\
    \ is used as a data transmission line for transmitting measurement information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\
    \n&lt;p&gt;This method of transmitting information signals in urban conditions\
    \ is not very acceptable. Ground-based objects reflect electromagnetic radiation\
    \ of the head transmitter which leads to distortion of the directional diagram\
    \ of the emitter and complicates the reliable reception of measurement information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\
    \n&lt;p&gt;It was proposed to use an autonomous measuring system with an operating\
    \ frequency of 5&nbsp;GHz based on Wi-Fi technologies and an unconventional method\
    \ of transmitting measurement information using hollow steel bars in the piercing\
    \ unit itself. This transmission line has periodic discontinuities because of\
    \ the bar design. These discontinuities accumulate as the piercing head advances.\
    \ For the basic vibration type \u041D&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, more accurate\
    \ analytical expressions were obtained for calculating the power transfer coefficient\
    \ of the measurement signal in such non-uniform lines. It was shown that inhomogeneity\
    \ of the transmission line in comparison with its surface resistance does not\
    \ significantly affect the transmission coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For\
    \ example, damping in the line increased by 1.2&nbsp;dB with the maximum length\
    \ of inhomogeneity of 5&nbsp;mm and the total length of jointed bars of 50&nbsp;m.\
    \ It has been theoretically proven that the range of soil piercing with reliable\
    \ signal reception can be up to 50&nbsp;meters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proposed\
    \ method for transmitting information signals makes it possible to reduce the\
    \ transmitter power, ensure noise immunity of the measuring system, and reliable\
    \ reception of the measuring information throughout the entire piercing path&lt;/p&gt;"
