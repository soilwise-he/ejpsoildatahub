  title: Long-Term Efficacy of Biochar-Based Immobilization for Remediation of Heavy
    Metal-Contaminated Soil and Environmental Factors Impacting Remediation Performance
  abstract: 'The contamination of soil with heavy metals poses significant environmental
    and public health concerns. In recent

    years, biochar-based immobilization has emerged as a promising technique for remediating
    heavy metalcontaminated

    soil. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the long-term
    efficacy of

    biochar-based immobilization for remediating heavy metal-contaminated soil, along
    with an analysis of the

    environmental factors that impact the performance of this remediation strategy.
    We discuss the mechanisms

    underlying biochar effectiveness in immobilizing heavy metals and its role in
    enhancing soil quality. Furthermore,

    we explore the interactions between biochar, soil microorganisms, and plants,
    and their combined influence on the

    overall remediation process. The review also delves into the challenges and future
    prospects of utilizing biocharbased

    immobilization for sustainable and efficient soil remediation.'
