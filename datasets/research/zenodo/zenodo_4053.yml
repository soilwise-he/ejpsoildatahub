  title: Effect of Cow Manure on Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogent, and Growth
    of Choy Sum in Gold Mine Tailings
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mining activities in Bogor, Indonesia produce tailings contaminated with
    heavy metal Hg that can cause damage to physical, chemical, and soil properties.
    This research was carried out from October 2022 to February 2023 at greenhouse
    experiment was conducted in Jatinangor Campus, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas
    Padjadjaran, West Java, Indonesia. The use of cow manure (CM) can improve substrate
    characteristics from tailings. The research was conducted to determine the effect
    of cow manure on plant height, number of leaves, fresh and dry shoot weight, organic-carbon,
    and total soil nitrogent. Greenhouse research was set up in Factorial Randomized
    Block Design. Choy sum plant variety is Shinta were planted 35 days with five
    treatments and five replications of CM. The used 450 g CM mixed with 550 g tailing
    gave the highest plant height, number of leaves, fresh and dry shoot weight of
    plant; organic-carbon, and total nitrogent in substrate. The experiment suggested
    that tailing mixed with CM is prominent to improve substrate characteristics and
    growth of choy sum.&lt;/p&gt;'
