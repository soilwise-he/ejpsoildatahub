  title: ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF SOME RHIZOBIAL BACTERIA FROM FABA BEAN PLANTS
    UNDER EGYPTIAN SOIL CONDITIONS.
  abstract: Legumes are the most important source of human food and forage. Legumes
    are able to provide the benefits of nitrogen fixation thanks to a strain of soil
    bacteria. Faba bean is the most important food legume. Moreover, it plays an important
    role in sustaining the productivity of the farming system through fixation of
    atmospheric nitrogen. Sixteen rhizobial isolates were collected from the root
    nodules in various locations under different soil conditions. Data indicated that
    most of the obtained isolates were superior compared to reference strains used.
    All rhizobial isolates tested were fast growing on YEMA medium, non-capsulated,
    short rods, Gram negative and motile. Cell size ranged from 1 to 4 mm. According
    to various NaCl Concentrations (from 0.0 to 6.5%), most of the tested isolates
    have a positive growth up to 4.5%, but both isolates K-ISORH7 and K-ISORH15 gave
    good growth at 6.0% NaCl Concentration. The most potent isolates were K-ISORH7
    and K-ISORH15 which recorded highest number of nodules (172, 188) for faba bean
    variety V1 and (122,125) for V2, nodules dry weight (597, 607) mg per plant for
    V1 and (395 ,607) mg per plant with V2 ,in the same order as compares to all tested
    isolates and strains. It took the same trend for the rest of parameters. Genetically,
    according to 16S rRNA sequence, isolates were identified as Rhizobium sp. By 100%
    similarity with HR7(KM276562) and strain SEMIA 439 (MH236581) for K-ISORH7 and
    K-ISORH15 respectively with accession numbers LC431741 and LC431742 in the same
    order.
