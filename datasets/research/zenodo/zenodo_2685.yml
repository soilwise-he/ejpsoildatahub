  title: Loss of soil biodiversity through judicious use of synthetic pesticides,
    A case study of trans-Nzoia County Kenya-review
  abstract: "Trans Nzoia County is one of Kenya\u2019s leading food basket regions\
    \ and enjoys favorable climatic conditions for crop production. With climatic\
    \ change, farmers face challenges of soil infertility and pest and disease infestation,\
    \ contributing to crop yield losses. Trans Nzoia County farmers rely heavily on\
    \ synthetic pesticides to boost crop production and yields. In Kenya, 44% of the\
    \ chemical pesticides used are banned in the EU market. Of these, 76% of the total\
    \ volume sold contains active ingredients such as glyphosate, mancozeb, and paraquat,\
    \ categorized as highly hazardous pesticides. Pesticide-intensive agriculture\
    \ is on the rise in Trans Nzoia County, and the associated pollution are the driving\
    \ factor in the precipitous decline of soil biodiversity, such as ground-nesting\
    \ bees and beetles. Also, overreliance on synthetic pesticides contributes to\
    \ the loss of beneficial soil microorganisms such as mycorrhizal species and earthworms\
    \ responsible for nitrogen fixation, organic matter decomposition, and water and\
    \ nutrient absorption. The author provides insights into the extent of the loss\
    \ of beneficial soil organisms through synthetic pesticides. This review discusses\
    \ the impacts and costs of pesticide use on soil organisms and policy responses."
