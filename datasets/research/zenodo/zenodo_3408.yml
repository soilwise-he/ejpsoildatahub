  title: Soil Transmitted Helminth Infection In Okpoko, An Urban Slum
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil transmitted helminth infections are known to be endemic
    in developing&nbsp; countries. We investigated soil transmitted helminth infection
    at Okpoko community an urban slum. Fresh stool samples were collected from 808
    patients randomly selected from five health facilities in the community. Stool
    samples were examined for presence of helminthes using the Stoll&rsquo;s dilution
    method. Hookworm was the most common helminth identified in the community (64.4%).
    Other soil transmitted helminths identified were &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides
    &lt;/em&gt;(29.6%)&nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Trichuris trichiura &lt;/em&gt;(2.2%), &lt;em&gt;Enterobius
    vermicularis (1.5%), Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;stearcoralis&lt;/em&gt;
    (0.7%), &lt;em&gt;Hymenlopsis nana&lt;/em&gt; (0.7%) and Taenia species (0.7%).
    &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansonii &lt;/em&gt;was not identified in this study. Multiple
    infection occurred in individuals with Hookworm and Ascaris the most prevalent
    (3.0%). The triad Ascaris, Hookworm and &lt;em&gt;Trichuris trichiura&lt;/em&gt;
    accounted for 1.5% among the multiple infected population. An overall prevalence
    of soil transmitted helminth infection of 17.1% was observed. There was no predilection
    for gender with intestinal helminth infection in Okpoko community (females 9.7%
    vs 7.3% males). Children less than 10 years had the greatest helminth infection
    rate (38.5%). It is therefore imperative that sanitation and education of the
    populace be improved upon to reduce helminthiasis in the community.&lt;/p&gt;'
