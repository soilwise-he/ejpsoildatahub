  title: Biomass Yield of Selected Herbaceous and Woody Industrial Crops across Marginal
    Agricultural Sites with Shallow Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Agricultural land in Europe is affected by low rooting depth
    (LRD) on 27.9 Mha. This marginal agricultural land can potentially be used to
    grow industrial crops without directly threatening food security or biodiversity
    conservation. However, little is known about the yield performance of industrial
    crops at LRD conditions. This study therefore compiles and discusses the meaningful
    data available in scientific literature. Twelve relevant industrial crops were
    identified for Europe. Currently, robust information on good growth suitability
    for LRD conditions is available for only one industrial crop, namely reed canary
    grass (RCG). Because this information was taken from field trial results from
    a single site, it remains unclear what role other growing conditions such as soil
    quality and climate play on both the yield level and the biomass quality of RCG
    under LRD conditions. These uncertainties about the quantitative as well as qualitative
    performance of industrial crop cultivation on marginal agricultural land characterized
    by LRD represent a major agronomic knowledge gap. Here, more knowledge needs to
    be compiled through both expanded crop science activities and improved international
    information exchange to make more optimal use of the large LRD areas available
    for the transition to a bioeconomy.&lt;/p&gt;'
