  title: Influence of Root Exudates and Soil on Attachment of Pasteuria penetrans
    to Meloidogyne arenaria
  abstract: 'Abstract: The bacterium Pasteuria penetrans is a parasite of root-knot
    nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Endospores of P. penetrans attach to the cuticle
    of second-stage juveniles (J2) and subsequently sterilize infected females. When
    encumbered by large numbers of spores, juveniles are less mobile and their ability
    to infect roots is reduced. This study looked at different factors that influence
    spore attachment of P. penetrans to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria.
    Pretreatment of J2 with root exudates of eggplant (Solanum melongena cv. Black
    beauty) reduced spore attachment compared with pretreatment with phosphate-buffered
    saline (PBS), suggesting that the nematode surface coat was altered or the spore
    recognition domains on the nematode surface were blocked. Spore attachment was
    equally reduced following exposure to root exudates from both host and nonhost
    plants for M. arenaria, indicating a common signal that affects spore attachment.
    Although phytohormones have been shown to influence the lipophilicity of the nematode
    surface coat, auxins and kinetins did not affect spore attachment compared with
    PBS. Root exudates reduced spore attachment more in sterilized soil than in natural
    soil. Sterilization may have eliminated microbes that consume root exudates, or
    altered the chemical components of the soil solution or root exudates. Root exudates
    caused a greater decrease in spore attachment in loamy sand than in a sandy loam
    soil. The sandy loam had higher clay content than the loamy sand, which may have
    resulted in more adsorption of compounds in the root exudates that affect spore
    attachment. The components of the root exudates could have also been modified
    by soil type. The results of this study demonstrate that root exudates can decrease
    the attachment of P. penetrans endospores to root-knot nematodes, indicating that
    when these nematodes enter the root zone their susceptibility to spore attachment
    may decrease.'
