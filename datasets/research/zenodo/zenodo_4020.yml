  title: Application of Remote Sensing and Geo Statistical Analysis for Soil Salinity
    Monitoring in Tina Plain Area of Egypt
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In Egypt require to improve agricultural production to save
    food demand with increase population. Soil salinity is a significant attractive
    problem for agriculture in irrigated areas. As a result, monitoring of soil salinity
    is required for salinization control. One of the greatest challenges faced by
    Egypt&rsquo;s decision-makers is the acquisition of reliable integrated soil salinity
    information to introduce and recommendation of a simple approach to formulating
    a guideline for stakeholders. Saline affected areas are vast, making it extremely
    difficult to examine soil quality with field and laboratory data to provide reliable
    approach to forecast and monitor soil salinity. Objective of this paper is to
    research remote sensing and ArcGIS tools by Geo-Statistical Analyst techniques
    to map saline-sodic heavy clay soils of the Tina plain area in Egypt. Tina Plain
    characterizes a serious area for potential development of agricultural land in
    Egypt. Satellite images were downloaded by Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1,
    and Synthetic Aperture Radar C-band data were wont to map soil salinity within
    the area. By coefficient of correlation method were preformed, evaluated and compared
    of the Three models. The results revealed that the Sentinel-2A optical imaging
    satellite yielded the very best prediction performance. ArcGIS Geo-Statistical
    Analyst was also successfully wont to predict and map the saline-sodic heavy clay
    soils with a mistake percentage of about 4.28%, which is taken into account as
    a minor error. generally, the study confirms that the Remote Sensing and ArcGIS
    Geo-Statistical Analyst are often considered by researchers and decision-makers
    as a credible, cost-effective, and time-controlled techniques to work out and
    predict the extension of soil salinity.&lt;/p&gt;'
