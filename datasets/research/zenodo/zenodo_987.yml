  title: Recovery of soil microbial community structure and activity following partial
    sterilization
  abstract: Soil microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, archea, protozoa) directly
    and indirectly influence all other trophic interactions in soil. Partial soil
    sterilization by gamma irradiation is emerging as a promising defanauting technique
    to remove specific target group of organisms with minimal soil disturbance. While
    considering the selective elimination of a target organism, it is crucial that
    microbial community has recovered to its original state. The microbial community
    should return back to its original state shortly after partial sterilization,
    but to date there are no studies on the dynamics of microbial recovery following
    partial sterilization.
