  title: AGROCHEMICAL INDICATORS OF THE SOIL DEPENDING ON THE STANDARDS OF MINERAL
    FERTILIZERS
  abstract: In order to increase the organic matter in the soil in order to obtain
    a high and quality product from the amaranth plant, after harvesting the cotton
    crop of cotton, which is the main crop, rye and rapeseed were planted as siderate
    crops. In early spring, 380-400 ts/ha of blue mass was thrown on the ground and
    plowed. As a result, it was observed that the amount of humus in the soil increased
    by 0.001%, and the general forms of nutrients increased by 0.001-0.002%.
