  title: Report on centrifuge test techniques with Soil Structure Interaction
  abstract: 'Soil-structure interaction plays an important role in the dynamic response
    of many types of structures. In the SERIES project the dynamic soil structure
    interaction is investigated for a single degree of freedom structure. This is
    an interesting problem where the dynamic response of the

    structure combines with the lifting-off of the base during rocking vibrations.
    Two types of single degree of freedom structures were considered, one with a lumped
    mass at the top and the other with a sway-frame.

    Several centrifuge tests were carried out changing the structures and soil densities.
    Again there was some overlap between the test specifications. The structures tested
    at UCAM had bearing pressures of 50 kPa and 100 kPa, while those tested at IFSTTAR
    had 100 kPa and 300 kPa. Similarly the

    stiffness of structure was changed in different centrifuge tests. The construction
    of the model structures was matched as closely as possible between the two centres.
    The dynamic response of the structures subjected to model earthquake loading was
    measured in several different ways. Some techniques of measurement were common
    between UCAM and

    IFSTTAR, while others such as advanced dynamic PIV measurements based on fast
    digital imaging were carried out at UCAM only. This technique is able give the
    soil displacement vectors at different points within an earthquake loading cycle.
    In all centrifuge tests, the accelerations within

    the soil and at different locations on the structure were measured using miniature
    accelerometers. The acceleration data was used to obtain the moment-rotation loops
    for the structure for different earthquakes. These were compared for structures
    of different stiffness, foundation soil placed at different relative densities
    and earthquakes of different intensity and frequency content. In this report details
    are given of the general theory of centrifuge modelling. This is followed by the
    experimental facilities, centrifuge model containers, instrumentation and data
    acquisition used at UCAM and IFSTTAR facilities. The details of the design of
    different model structures are also presented. Following this, the model preparation
    techniques including the air-pluviation devices

    used are presented. The technique of PIV analysis using digital images from a
    fast digital camera is introduced. Following this the experimental data obtained
    in each centrifuge test such as acceleration time histories, settlement time histories
    and the results of the analyses of the data in the form of moment-rotation loops
    are presented. Results from some of the selected PIV analysis are 2 also shown.
    Finally a brief summary of the research carried out in JRA 3.2 work package and
    the main outcomes are presented.'
