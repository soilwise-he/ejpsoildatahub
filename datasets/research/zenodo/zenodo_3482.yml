  title: BIODIVERSITY OF MARINE FUNGAL SPECIES FROM SEA SHORE SOIL SAMPLE.
  abstract: In the present study investigated the mycodiversity of the three spots
    (Ramnad, Tuticorin, Memesal) Tamilnadu, India. The marine soil samples were taken
    by scrapping off the surface and sub-surface to a depth of 10 cm. Approxiametely
    1.5 kg of soils were collected from each site and put in plastic bags and labeled
    based on the collection sites. Marine fungi are the potential and promising sources
    for biologically active secondary metabolic production. The microbiological analysis
    results were subjected to statistical and physico-chemical parameters of the marine
    soil should be analysed.
