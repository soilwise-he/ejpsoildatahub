  title: Heavy Metals And Some Physicochemical Parameters In Soil Of Major Domestic
    Dumpsites In Akure Township, Ondo State, South-Western Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong><em>Heavy metals and soil physicochemical parameters were identified\
    \ as environmental pollutants in some major domestic dumpsites in Akure city of\
    \ Ondo state. The pH of the domestic dumpsites ranged from 7.07 to 7.69 with a\
    \ mean value of 7.33. the organic carbon for the domestic dumpsites ranged from\
    \ 0.46% to 1.18%, while the organic matter was between 0.80% and 2.05%. the concentration\
    \ of Zn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni and Cr in \xB5g/g in the domestic dumpsites A and\
    \ B ranged between 360.00-441, 169.60-547.20, 37.20-102.00, 18.80-80.00, 2.36-2.95,\
    \ 11.00-19.20 and 18.00- 42.20 all in \xB5g/g respectively. Also, the contamination\
    \ pollution index of Zn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni and Cr all in the domestic dumpsites\
    \ A and B ranged between 2.57-3.15, not detected, 1.03-2.83, 0.32-0.94, 2.95-3.68,\
    \ 0.31-0.55 and 0.18-0.46 respectively. Pearson correlation indicated that Zn,\
    \ Fe, Ni and Pb were highly significant (p&lt;0.01)</em>.</strong>"
