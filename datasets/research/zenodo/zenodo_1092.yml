  title: Micro level differential pulse polarographic determination of zirconium in
    soil samples
  abstract: "Electroanalytical Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, J. N. V. University,\
    \ Jodhpur-342 005, Rajasthan, India <em>E-mail </em>: shailly.d24@gmail.com <em>Manuscript\
    \ received online 31 January 2013, revised 22 February 2013, accepted 23 February\
    \ 2013</em> A simple and convenient differential pulse polarographic method is\
    \ described for the determination of low concentration of zirconium in soil samples.\
    \ The present study was undertaken keeping in view of the fact that choice of\
    \ a medium for polarographic investigations in case of zirconium is limited due\
    \ to its very negative reduction potential. Among different supporting electrolytes\
    \ investigated for the study of Zr<sup>IV</sup> at DME, 0.01 <em>M </em>KNO<sub>3</sub>\
    \ was found most adequate where Zr<sup>IV</sup> displayed single polarographic\
    \ wave at a potential of \u20131.01 V. Cu<sup>II</sup>, Pb<sup>II</sup>, Cd<sup>II</sup>,\
    \ Zn<sup>II</sup>, Cr<sup>VI</sup>, Ni<sup>II</sup>, V<sup>V</sup> and Mn<sup>II</sup>\
    \ did not interfere. It was observed that on increasing the concentration of zirconium\
    \ the peak current increased linearly upto a concentration of 2.2 ppm. Limit of\
    \ determination was observed to be 0.01 ppm."
