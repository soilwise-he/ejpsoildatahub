  title: Systematic Review of the Literature on Various Soil Classification Methods
  abstract: Traditional methods for classifying soil have many challenges, such as
    being time-consuming, very expensive,<br> intrusive, among others. By measuring
    precise soil properties including moisture, temperature, humidity, PH, and<br>
    nutrient content/fertility, soil monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    help improve agriculture by<br> improving production. Then, with the help of the
    right data operations, this data is collected in cloud storage,<br> allowing us
    to improve farming tactics and produce trend analyses. This, then, allows us to
    precisely utilize<br> resources and steer our farming methods in prudent ways
    to optimize yield. In this research, we have reviewed<br> many articles related
    to soil classifications and their various methods and techniques of classification.<br>
