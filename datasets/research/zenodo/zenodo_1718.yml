  title: Study on the Properties of Natural Soil Stabilized with Various Percentages
    of Lime Contents
  abstract: 'This paper presents study of the stabilization of natural soil with lime.
    Firstly, Soil samples from Madaya Township are collected and several laboratory
    tests are carried out to determine the characteristics and engineering properties
    of the studied soil. Then experimental tests have been conducted for the determination
    of Atterberg limits and California Bearing Ratio CBR values. The studied soil
    contains more than 50 of silt clay fraction. So, the studied soil is stabilized
    with lime contents selected as 5 and 10 by weight of natural soil at maximum dry
    density. When soil samples are mixed with lime, the values of liquid limit, plasticity
    index and CBR values are changed. These changes are decreased in swelling and
    shrinking potential of the soil, decreased in the settlement of the pavements,
    increase in workability and increase in the bearing capacity of the soils. In
    this study, the CBR values of soil lime mixtures are 71.4 and 64.4 higher than
    that of studied soil. It can be seen that the CBR value of lime 5 is greater than
    lime 10 and natural soil. So, soil lime mixture with lime 5 content is suiTablefor
    soil stabilization of the street, road and highway. Nyein Nyein Thant | Tin Yadanar
