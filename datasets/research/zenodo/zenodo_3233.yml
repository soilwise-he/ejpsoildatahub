  title: 'AFFORESTATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND WITH PINUS RADIATA D. DON AND BETULA
    ALBA L. IN NW SPAIN: EFFECTS ON SOIL PH, UNDERSTOREY PRODUCTION AND FLORISTIC
    DIVERSITY ELEVEN YEARS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT'
  abstract: "Afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands has been the main change\
    \ in land use over the past decade in Europe. However, the impact of tree species\
    \ and understorey management on production and plant diversity over the medium-\
    \ and long-term has not been thoroughly studied. This paper aims to evaluate the\
    \ effects of an afforestation of Pinus radiata D. Don and Betula alba L. on soil\
    \ pH, understorey production and plant diversity and life cycle type (annuals\
    \ vs. perennials) managed with different soil fertilisation treatments over a\
    \ period of 11 years. The results show an acidification of the soil 11 years after\
    \ establishment, better vertical growth and diameter of pine compared with birch\
    \ as usually happens in the region and important variation in the biomass production\
    \ and composition of the understorey below both tree species. Understorey species\
    \ remained similar during the first 5 years below both canopies. However, species\
    \ richness (S) was drastically reduced under Pinus radiata D. Don plantation compared\
    \ to Betula alba L. (Spine\xBC2 vs. Sbirch\xBC17) after 11 years of tree establishment\
    \ at a very high density (2500 trees ha 1). Inorganic and organic fertilisation\
    \ also caused a reduction in floristic diversity. Soil pH, pasture production\
    \ and floristic understorey plant diversity are better preserved under autochthonous\
    \ broadleaves, which increased the multiple uses of recently afforested lands\
    \ in the short- and medium-term. In the European context of high need for sawn\
    \ wood, the use of autochthonous broadleaved tree species like Betula should be\
    \ promoted due to their better sustainability."
