  title: "Origin of carbon in agricultural soil profiles deduced from depth gradients\
    \ of C:N ratios, carbon fractions, \u03B413C and \u03B415N values"
  abstract: '&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Agricultural soils in Germany store 2.54 Pg of organic carbon (C). However,
    information about how and when this C entered the soils is limited. This study
    illustrates how depth profiles of organic matter can shed light on different entry
    paths of organic C.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Machine learning was used to explain total organic C (TOC), C:N, particulate
    organic C (POC), &delta;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &delta;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N
    values down to 100&nbsp;cm depth based on pedology, geology, climate and management-related
    variables from the German Agricultural Soil Inventory. We estimated TOC turnover
    rates based on the relationship between the proportion of maize (only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
    plant) in crop rotations and soil &delta;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the upper 30&nbsp;cm of cropland, fresh photosynthates added on average
    0.2 to 0.8&nbsp;Mg C ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;&thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; year&lt;sup&gt;&minus;&thinsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    Organic fertiliser was another source of topsoil C, especially in grassland. Sandy
    sites in north-west Germany contained historic C from past heathland and peatland.
    One third of German agricultural land was found to be on colluvial and alluvial
    deposits, in which allochthonous C from upstream and upslope areas evidently increased
    the TOC content of subsoils. In and below hardpans, TOC content and C:N and POC:TOC
    ratios were low, indicating restricted root-derived C input.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our data indicate that ongoing management in German agricultural soils
    mainly affects topsoil C, while C storage in subsoils reveals significant legacies
    from allochthonous, buried or translocated C inputs. Specific attention should
    be focused on the sustainable loosening of hardpans that could result in a slow,
    but significant increase in subsoil C stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
