  title: Influence of Ageing on Quality of a Liquid Organic Formulation Used to Increase
    Soil Fertility
  abstract: '<em>Use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has drastically affected
    the soil quality and also the products obtained leading to a number of diseases.
    In order to sustain the nutrient quality of the crops, thus protecting the mankind
    from falling prey to the disease causing chemicals retained in the crops, a system
    of natural farming using a liquid organic formulation providing replenishment
    to soil nutrients and natural regeneration was used.</em>


    <em>Further, a study on influence of ageing on quality of a liquid organic formulation
    used to increase the nutrient content and fertility of the soil was carried out
    at Department of Pharmacognosy, KLE College of Pharmacy, Bengaluru, India. The
    main objective was to find out the shelf life of Liquid organic formulation by
    analyzing its physical and microbiological properties. Liquid organic formulation
    was stored for 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 41 and 49 days. Change in colour, odour,
    pH and microbiological activity of the soil fertility favoring organism was carefully
    observed during the storage period. The microbial load which were large in number
    and motile, gradually reduced during the 35 day study and later on was found non
    motile and dead in the 41 day study. The investigation revealed the possibility
    of storing Liquid organic formulation upto 35 days without quality and microbial
    deterioration. So a shelf life of 35 days can be fixed for usage of the liquid
    organic preparation.</em>'
