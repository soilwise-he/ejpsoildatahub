  title: Spatial and temporal variations of soil microbial respiration under native
    and exotic tree species
  abstract: "Different tree species can directly or indirectly affect soil conditions.\_\
    \_ They influence soil microbial diversity and abundance and hence soil respiration.\
    \ Trees and soil respiration have a complex relationship that is poorly understood,\
    \ as does the seasonal and spatial variation that naturally occurs in them. This\
    \ study was therefore conducted to evaluate soil respiration processes under two\
    \ native tree species, Msuku (Uapaca kirkiana) and Mtondo (Julbernardia paniculata),\_\
    and one introduced tree species, Malaina (Gmelina arborea). In 2019 (March and\
    \ October), soil samples were taken at 0.5m, 1.5m, 2.5 m, and 3.5m intervals from\
    \ the trunks of the chosen tree species at depths of 0\u201310 cm and 10\u2013\
    20 cm. Using the alkali absorption method, soil respiration was assessed. The\
    \ findings demonstrated that respiration decreased with the increase in horizontal\
    \ distance from the trunk of both indigenous species. On the contrary, soil respiration\
    \ increased with the increase in horizontal distances from the trunks of introduced\
    \ tree species. The findings also demonstrated that respiration was higher at\
    \ 0\u201310 cm than at 10\u201320 cm soil depths in both March and October under\
    \ all three tree species. The higher microbial soil respiration in the surface\
    \ layer could be attributed to better soil aeration, as opposed to the sub-surface\
    \ soil. Furthermore, soil respiration was higher for soils collected in March\
    \ than soils collected in October, probably because March is associated with the\
    \ rainy season in which soil moisture content is higher than October. It can be\
    \ concluded that different tree species strongly influence spatial and vertical\
    \ soil respiration differently. This calls for proper selection of tree species\
    \ to be utilised in agroforestry. \n\nTherefore, knowledge of nutrient uptake\
    \ of various tree species and the influence of tree species on soil processes,\
    \ but also microbial population effects on nutrient cycling linked to various\
    \ tree species is essential."
