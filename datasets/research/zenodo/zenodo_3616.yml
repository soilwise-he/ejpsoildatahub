  title: Investigation Of Heavy Metals Uptake By Vegetable Crops From Metal-Contaminated
    Soil
  abstract: 'The use of sewage sludge and effluents from

    wastewater treatment plants for irrigation of agricultural lands is on

    the rise particularly in peri-urban areas of developing countries.

    The reuse of nutrients and organic matter in treated wastewater

    and sewage sludge via land application is a desirable goal. However,

    trace or heavy metals present in sludge pose the risk of human or

    phytotoxicity from land application. Long-term use of sewage

    sludge, heavy metals can accumulate to phytotoxic levels and results

    in reduced plants growth and/or enhanced metal concentrations in

    plants, which consumed by animals then enter the food chain. In this

    research, the amount of heavy metals was measured in plants

    irrigated with wastewater and sludge application. For this purpose,

    three pilots were made in a Shush treatment plant in south of Tehran.

    Three plants species, spinach, lettuce and radish were selected and

    planted in the pilots.First pilot was irrigated just with wastewater of

    treatment plant and second pilot was irrigated with wastewater and

    sludge application .Third pilot was irrigated with simulated heavy

    metals solution equal 50 years of irrigation. The results indicate that

    the average of amount of heavy metals Pb, Cd in three plant species

    in first pilot were lower than permissible limits .In second pilot,

    Cadmium accumulations are high in three species plants and more

    than the standard limits. Concentration of Cd , Pb have exceed their

    permitted limits in plants in third pilot . It was concluded that the use

    of wastewater and sludge application in agricultural lands enriched

    soils with heavy metals to concentrations that may pose potential

    environmental and health risks in the long-term.'
