  title: Profile Distribution of Physical and Chemical Soil Properties in Izombe,
    Rainforest Zone of Nigeria.
  abstract: "The assessment of the distribution of soil physico-chemical properties\
    \ facilitates the use of proper soil management practices. Hence, the study was\
    \ conducted in Izombe rainforest of Nigeria to ascertain the profile distribution\
    \ of physical and chemical soil properties. Samples were collected from two profile\
    \ pits base on horizon differentiation for laboratory analyses using standard\
    \ procedures. Data generated were analyzed statistically using coefficient of\
    \ variation and correlation. The result indicated that sand recorded 760 g kg-1\
    \ in pedon 1, 730.20 g kg-1 in pedon 2 and was predominant in the soil with higher\
    \ amount at the surface horizon while clay and silt increased down the pedons.\
    \ Bulk density ranges from 1.14 \u2013 1.79 g cm-3. The AB horizon was the least\
    \ acidic of the pedons. Most soil chemical properties decreased down the profile.\
    \ Sand and pH had low variation (\u22654.80 % \u226412.60 %) while silt, organic\
    \ carbon, total nitrogen had high variation (\u226541.52 % \u226479.58 %) among\
    \ the horizons. Fe, Mn and Zn had moderate to high variation among the horizons.\
    \ Clay correlated negatively and highly significantly (r= -0.829, r= - 0.883,\
    \ p= 0.01) available phosphorus and Fe. Clay also had a positive significant correlation\
    \ (r= 0.665, r= 0.641, p= 0.05) with bulk density and base saturation. pH had\
    \ a significant negative relationship (r= -0.708, p= 0.05) with base saturation\
    \ while cation exchange capacity had a highly significant positive correlation\
    \ (r= 0.877, p= 0.01) with Pb. Fe had a negative and highly significant relationship\
    \ (r= -0.838, p= 0.01) with Zn. The result indicated that most mineral element\
    \ are domiciled in the A horizon and such demand proper management practices for\
    \ soil nutrients sustainability."
