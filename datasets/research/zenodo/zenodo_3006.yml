  title: Do soil features condition seed germination of gypsophiles and gypsovags?
    An analysis of the effect of natural soils along an alkalinity gradient
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Gypseous soils are widespread across drylands worldwide. They
    present remarkable challenges to plants and host a unique flora. We aimed to assess
    if the specificity and distribution of species on gypsum might be driven by species-specific
    germination responses to soil gypsum availability. We analyzed the germination
    of six gypsum specialists (gypsophiles) and four closely related &lt;a title="Learn

    species&lt;/a&gt; (gypsovags) from the Iberian Peninsula and the Chihuahuan Desert
    in different field soils with contrasting concentrations of gypsum, pH and &lt;a

    Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-texture"&gt;soil
    texture&lt;/a&gt;. Plant restriction to gypsum was unrelated to the germinating
    ability of seeds on different substrates. Irrespective of their affinity for gypsum,
    most species germinated better on mixed gypsum-calcareous soil and worse in the
    acidic soil treatment. Our data suggest soil pH and Ca availability were the main
    soil features driving &lt;a title="Learn more about seed germination from ScienceDirect''s

    germination&lt;/a&gt;, while the effect of gypsum content was generally not significant.
    The main exception was the Iberian gypsophile &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Learn more

    soils and higher germination in response to increased soil gypsum content. Except
    for this species, our findings indicate &lt;a title="Learn more about alkaline

    soils&lt;/a&gt; with high Ca availability favor the germination of most of the
    species analyzed, irrespectively of their gypsum content&lt;/p&gt;'
