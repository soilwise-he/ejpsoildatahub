  title: Sensitivity of Bunker Cave to climatic forcings highlighted through multi-annual
    monitoring of rain-, soil-, and dripwaters
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The last two decades have seen a considerable increase in studies
    using speleothems as archives of past climate&lt;br&gt;

    variability. Caves under study are now monitored for a wide range of environmental
    parameters and results&lt;br&gt;

    placed in contextwith speleothemdata. The present study investigates trends froma
    seven year longmonitoring&lt;br&gt;

    of Bunker Cave, northwestern Germany, in order to assess the hydraulic response
    and transfer time of meteoric&lt;br&gt;

    water fromthe surface to the cave. Rain-, soil-, and dripwaterwere collected fromAugust
    2006 to August 2013 at&lt;br&gt;

    a monthly to bimonthly resolution and their oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition
    wasmeasured. Furthermore,&lt;br&gt;

    drip rates were quantified. Due to different drip characteristics, annualmean
    valueswere calculated for the&lt;br&gt;

    drip rates of each drip site. Correlations of the annualmean drip rate of each
    site with precipitation and infiltration&lt;br&gt;

    demonstrate that the annual infiltration, and thus the annual precipitation control
    the inter-annual drip-rate&lt;br&gt;

    variability for all except one site. The hydraulic response is not delayed on
    an annual basis. All drip sites display&lt;br&gt;

    identical long-termtrends,which suggests a draining of a common karst reservoir
    over these seven years ofmonitoring.&lt;br&gt;

    Correlations of soil- and dripwater monthly &delta;18O and &delta;D values with
    atmospheric temperature data reveal&lt;br&gt;

    water transfer times of 3 months to reach a depth of 40 cm (soilwater at site
    BW 2) and 4 months for&lt;br&gt;

    70 cm depth (soilwater at site BW1). Finally, the water reaches the cave chambers
    (15 to 30 m below land surface)&lt;br&gt;

    after ca. 2.5 years. Consequently, a temporal offset of 29 to 31 months (ca. 2.5
    years) between the hydraulic&lt;br&gt;

    response time(no time lag on annual basis) and thewater transfer time (time lag
    of 29 to 31months)was found,&lt;br&gt;

    which is negligiblewith regard to Bunker Cave speleothems because of their slowgrowth
    rates. Here, proxies recording&lt;br&gt;

    precipitation/infiltration and temperature are registered on a decadal scale.
    Variations in drip rate and&lt;br&gt;

    thus precipitation and infiltration are recorded by &delta;13C and Mg/Ca ratios
    in speleothem calcite. Speleothem&lt;br&gt;

    &delta;18O values reflect both temperature and precipitation signals due to drip
    rate-related fractionation processes.&lt;br&gt;

    We document that long-term patterns in temperature and precipitation are recorded
    in dripwater patterns of&lt;br&gt;

    Bunker Cave and that these are linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).&lt;/p&gt;'
