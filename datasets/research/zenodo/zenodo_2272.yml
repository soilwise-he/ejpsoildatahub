  title: CONCENTRATION LEVELS OF LUBRICATING OILS ON CONCRETE FLOORS IN AN INDUSTRIAL
    LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND SUBSEQUENT SOIL CONTAMINATION
  abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of hydrocarbon
    pollutants on industrial floors lacking waterproofing protection and to understand
    the implications of these pollutants on soil contamination. Industrial floors
    are frequently exposed to various contaminants, such as oils and greases from
    diverse sources. In this investigation, a metalworking laboratory that had been
    operational for 42 years underwent the application of polyurethane-based paint
    on its concrete floor, resulting in the appearance of oil bubbles on the painted
    surface. Consequently, the primary objective of this research was to assess the
    degree of hydrocarbon contamination on the floor to comprehend the encountered
    issue. The conducted test, following the SM 5520E standard for hydrocarbon detection,
    revealed that in areas prone to pathological manifestations, the concentration
    of hydrocarbons increased by 74%, 45%, and 14% with each layer of protected concrete,
    compared to the equivalent layer in the control region. Furthermore, there was
    a notable concentration of hydrocarbons in the soil beneath the floor, registering
    a 51% increase compared to the control region and a substantial 91% increase compared
    to the adjacent concrete region.
