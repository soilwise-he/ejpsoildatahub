  title: Effect of Dilute Salt Solutions on Chernozem Soil Estimated Through the Hydration
    Properties of the Colloids
  abstract: Research Institute of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of Hungarian
    Academy of Sciences, Budapest <em>Received</em> 28 <em>July</em> 1972 Alkali soils
    containing illite with high exchangeable K are reported to be less susceptible
    than those containing montmorillonite to the adverse effect of sodium on their
    physical properties, Besides, that the adsorption complex of the former attains
    comparatively lower Na saturation than the latter, the other probable reason for
    this discrepancy seems to be the inherent difference in the degree of hydration
    of Na ions owing to differences in the bonding force available on the mineral
    surfaces. This aspect which is of practical value in understanding salt affected
    soils where these two minerals are dominant, was studied, Samples of chernozem
    soil (containing initially illite and montmorillonite) enriched with three levels
    of pure illite and bentonite were leached for a number of times in columns with
    single sale solutions of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
    and their clay fractions were studied by differential thermal and X-ray methods.
    Illite treated samples adsorbed less moisture at maximum hygroscopicity than montmorillonite
    treated ones, and the energy needed to drive off the :moisture from the illite
    treated samples, as indicated by differential thermal analysis, was also relatively
    higher than for montmorillonite samples. Basing on the location and force of sodium
    bonding on the surfaces of illite and montmorillonite, it was concluded that sodium
    ions had a tendency towards less hydration on illite than on montmorillonite.
