  title: "Isolation of Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria's (PBSs) from soil and to estimate\
    \ the amount of phosphate imbibed in the reservation granules by Fiske\u2013Subbarow\
    \ (F-S) method"
  abstract: Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) are one among the biofertilizers,
    because of their potential to convert insoluble phosphate to a soluble form by
    hydrolysis, by which the plants are able to gain phosphate readily. The process
    of hydrolysis of insoluble phosphate to soluble form is very clear whereas the
    amount of phosphate reserved in the cell is still missing. Reservation compounds
    are diverse by having a multiple chemical nature; they play a major role in phosphate
    storage, structural, biochemical by regulatory function. The most common phosphate
    reservoir includes polyPhosphate and Teichoic acid. In the present work, we have
    isolated the PSMs from soil and estimated the amount of phosphate imbibed in the
    phosphate storage/reservation granules by Fiske- Subburows method (F-S). We could
    make out as phosphate concentration increases from 0.028M (standard) growth of
    bacteria decline this could be due to change in pH of the media (basic), whereas
    when the concentration of phosphate decreases from the standard, bacteria starve
    and finally die this could be due to deficiency of phosphate. Similarly, when
    the concentration of phosphate is huge, bacterial cell consumes more phosphate
    from their surrounding and accumulate them in their reservation granules for cellular
    metabolism, growth, and development, whereas when phosphate is low in their surrounding
    bacterial growth cease.
