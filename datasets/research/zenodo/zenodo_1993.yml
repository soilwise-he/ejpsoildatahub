  title: Polyolefin-coated urea as a fertilizer for rice on soil with high nitrogen
    leaching loss
  abstract: This article 'Polyolefin-coated urea as a fertilizer for rice on soil
    with high nitrogen leaching loss' appeared in the International Rice Research
    Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite
    communication among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology
    for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists
    keep each other informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific
    notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to
    obtain details on the research reported.
