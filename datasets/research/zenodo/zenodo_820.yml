  title: Exchange Behaviour of Coen33+ on Soil and Peat Hymatomelanic Acids
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, University of North Bengal, P. O. North Bengal\
    \ University, Darjeeling-784 430 <em>Manuscript received 19 October 1981, revised\
    \ 11 August 1988, accepted 17 August 1988</em> The exchange pattern or \\(Coen_3^{3+}\\\
    ) on soil and peat hymatomelanic acids (SHy A and PHyA) resembles Langmuir type\
    \ of curves and is dependent on pH; the stronger acidic group, e.g. COOH predominately\
    \ participating in the interaction at lower pH. The release of Coen<sup>3+</sup>\
    \ from Coen<sup>3+</sup>- acid complexes exhibit that the orders of reactivity\
    \ for monovalent cations are H &gt;&gt; C<sub>s </sub>&gt; Rb&gt; K &gt; Na \\\
    (&gt;_&lt;\\) Li for Coea<sub>3</sub> - SHyA system and H &gt;&gt; C<sub>3 </sub>&gt;\
    \ Rb &gt; K &gt; Na &gt; Li for Coea<sub>3 </sub>-PHyA complex. The release isotherms\
    \ for bivalent and organic cations indicate the following sequence of reactivity\
    \ : Ba &gt; Sr \\(&gt;_&lt;\\) Ca &gt; Mg and (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\
    \ N &gt; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>N. The reversals of exchangeability for\
    \ Li and Na as well as for Ca and Sr are noticeable at lower concentration. The\
    \ exchange isotherms with monovalent cations display that the exchange processes\
    \ take place in three stages. The thermodynamic equilibrium constauts and Gibbs\
    \ free energy changes for exchange reactions involving bivalent cations have been\
    \ calculated by using Kielland's equation. The plots of logarithm of corrected\
    \ selectivity coefficients or thermodynamic equilibrium constants against hydrated\
    \ ionic radii and the reciprocals of the Debye- Huckel parameter <em>a</em><sup>\xB0\
    </sup> , Indicate that the relative affinities of the ions for the exchanger substrates\
    \ are much better correlated with <em>a</em><sup>\xB0</sup> rather than with ionic\
    \ radii."
