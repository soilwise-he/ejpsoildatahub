  title: Spectrophotometric Determination of Selenium in Soil and Alloys
  abstract: Department of Chemistry. University of Mysore, Mysore-570 006 Department
    of Chemistry, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore-560 024 <em>Manuscript
    received 27 July 1987, revised 9 February 1988, accepted 22 April 1988</em> A
    rapid method for spectrophotometric micro determination of selenium using propericiazine
    has been reported. A red radical cation is formed at 7-9 <em>M</em> HCI which
    absorbs maximum at 515 nm and stable for 2 h. Beer's Jaw is obeyed for upto 3.5
    \(\mu\)g selenium per ml. The molar absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity are
    3.736 K 10<sup>4</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol-<sup>1</sup> cm-<sup>1 </sup>and 0.002
    \(\mu\)g cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The optimum reaction conditions and other
    analytical parameters are evaluated. The proposed method is simple, rapid, selective
    and can be used for the determination of selenium content in soil and alloys.
