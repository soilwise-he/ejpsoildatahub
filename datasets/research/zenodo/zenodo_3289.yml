  title: IOT BASED SOIL TESTING.
  abstract: Soil Analysis has become an essential factor for effective cultivation.
    There are many existing methodologies for soil testing. Earlier soil testing was
    done in laboratories and research centers which took a lot of time and effort
    to achieve results. In today?s world, with advancements in technology and digitization,
    it has become possible to do soil testing using various portable sensors. With
    the help of IoT is has become possible to connect the sensors to the internet.
    We intend to use these sensors with IoT for performing soil testing anywhere and
    anytime. The existing methodologies test various parameters like moisture, respiration,
    bulk density, color texture, pH, temperature, etc. Testing various parameters
    will be costly. Thus, the aim of this project is to provide soil testing and analysis
    at the lowest possible cost. Analyzing a few parameters also provide the same
    result of analysis. Thus, we use affordable yet efficient sensors for testing
    soil parameters like pH, moisture, humidity and temperature. Performing analysis
    is the main challenge that will be addressed in this project. The existing systems
    used platform dependent system or hardware dependent system. Some testing methods
    used platforms like Losant, etc. to display result in form of graphical representation
    and then transferred readings via SMS. Some systems used hardware like Bluetooth
    or Zigbee to transfer results to the users mobile which when connected to internet
    uploaded the readings to the server and then gave analysis on the readings. This
    project intends to proceed by using Raspberry Pi which will enable sensor readings
    to be uploaded on the cloud. The system will the send the suitable crop list to
    the user?s mobile via SMS. On comparing results of the research papers and our
    expected output, we concluded that in our project, we need to collect the feedback
    from the users after certain period of time so that we can validate our predictions.
