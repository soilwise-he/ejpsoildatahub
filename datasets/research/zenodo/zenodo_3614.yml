  title: Political Economy of Integrated Soil Fertility Management in the Okavango
    Delta, Botswana
  abstract: "Although many factors play a crucial role in agricultural production\
    \ and productivity, the importance of soil fertility cannot be underestimated.\
    \ The extent to which small farmers are able to manage the fertility of their\
    \ farmlands is crucial in agricultural development particularly in sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa (SSA).  This paper assesses the nutrient status of selected farmers'\
    \ fields in relation to how government policy addresses the allocation of and\
    \ access to agricultural inputs (e.g. chemical fertilizers) in a unique social-ecological\
    \ environment of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. It also analyses small\
    \ farmers and soil scientists' perceptions about the political economy of integrated\
    \ soil fertility management (ISFM) in the area. A multi-stage sampling procedure\
    \ was used to elicit quantitative and qualitative information from 228 farmers\
    \ and 9 soil researchers through the use of interview schedules and questionnaires,\
    \ respectively. Knowledge validation workshops and focus group discussions (FGDs)\
    \ were also used to collect qualitative data from farmers. Soil samples were collected\
    \ from 33 farmers' plots in three farming communities of Makalamabedi, Nokaneng\
    \ and Mohembo for laboratory analysis. Although meeting points exists, farmers\
    \ and scientists have divergent perspectives on soil fertility management. Laboratory\
    \ analysis carried out shows that most soils in the wetland and the adjoining\
    \ dry-land/upland surroundings are low in essential nutrients as well as in cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Although results suggest the identification and use\
    \ of appropriate inorganic fertilizers, the low CEC is an indication that holistic\
    \ cultural practices, which are beyond mere chemical fertilizations, are critical\
    \ and more desirable for improved soil health and sustainable livelihoods in the\
    \ area. Farmers' age (t= -0.728; p\u22640.10); their perceptions about the political\
    \ economy (t = -0.485; p\u22640.01) of ISFM; and their preference for the use\
    \ of local knowledge in soil fertility management (t = -10.254; p\u22640.01) had\
    \ a significant relationship with how they perceived their involvement in the\
    \ implementation of ISFM."
