  title: Responses Of Selected Soil Chemical Properties And Heavy Metals As Affected
    By Sewage Dump Soil In Abakaliki Southeastern Nigeria
  abstract: "This study evaluated the responses of selected soil chemical properties\
    \ and heavy metals as affected by sewage dump in Abakaliki southeastern Nigeria.\
    \ A reconnaissance survey of the study area was carried out and the following\
    \ dump soils were selected: A (Abattoir sewage dump), B (Cassava sewage dump),\
    \ C. (Domestic sewage dump) and D (Control \u2013 Non-sewage dump soil). Five\
    \ replicate auger soil samples were collected I m away from each dump at 0 \u2013\
    \ 30 cm soil depth and used for the determination of soil ph, Organic C, total\
    \ N, available P, exchangeable bases, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Cr. The results showed\
    \ that sewage improves soil chemical properties.  The heavy metals observed were\
    \ also higher in sewage dump soils than the control. Similarly, the soil study\
    \ was sandy loam. Therefore, stringent measures must be taken while dumping sewage\
    \ in these soils soil since the soil can easily contaminants from sewage to underground\
    \ water."
