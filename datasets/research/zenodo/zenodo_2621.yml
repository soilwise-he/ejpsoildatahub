  title: Impact of ectohumus application in birch and pine nurseries on the presence
    of soil mites (Acari), Oribatida in particular
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Intensively used forest nurseries are characterised by degradation\
    \ processes that lead to a drop in the quality of seedlings. The main reason of\
    \ this problem is a decrease in biological soil diversity. Therefore, an attempt\
    \ of nursery soil enrichment by introducing ectohumus &ndash; as compost and fresh\
    \ litter &ndash; from the pine forest was carried out. The research was carried\
    \ out in 2009&ndash;2011 in the Bielawy forest nursery near the city of Toru\u0144\
    , Poland. The objective of the study was to determine the impact of organic fertilisation\
    \ (compost made up of forest humus) and mulching using fresh ectohumus on the\
    \ density and community composition of Acari mites and on species composition\
    \ of oribatid mites (Oribatida) in the nurseries of silver birch and Scots pine.\
    \ Mites, especially oribatid mites, were treated as bioindicators of soil biological\
    \ activity. Research has shown that mulching using fresh ectohumus caused a multiple\
    \ increase in the density of mites, especially in saprophagous mites Oribatida.\
    \ Oribatid mites were clearly more numerous in birch cultivation than in that\
    \ of pine. Overall, 27 species of oribatid mites were found. Mulching resulted\
    \ in a significant growth in species diversity in both cultivations. The most\
    \ numerous oribatid mite in the area under the study was &lt;em&gt;Oribatula tibialis&lt;/em&gt;.\
    \ This species was present in all plots and showed clear preference for birch\
    \ cultivation. &lt;em&gt;Tectocepheus velatus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Oppiella\
    \ nova&lt;/em&gt;, common and known to be present in a variety of environments,\
    \ were slightly less numerous.&lt;/p&gt;"
