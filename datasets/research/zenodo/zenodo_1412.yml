  title: Total and watersoluble organic matter content in soil under various methods
    of forestry
  abstract: "Water-base organic compounds are among the most labile fractions of soil\
    \ organic matter. Their content are considered a sensitive indicator of soil quality\
    \ and changes quantitatively under the influence of anthropogenic pressure. The\
    \ objective of this paper was to evaluate the impacts of different felling systems\
    \ on total and water extractable organic carbon content in soil. The soil samples\
    \ were taken from 50 cm depth soil profile with 5 cm step. Total organic carbon\
    \ (TOC), cold water extractable organic carbon (CWEOC) and hot water extractable\
    \ organic carbon (HWEOC) contents in soil were determined. The highest TOC content\
    \ was found in the soil under the old-growth hornbeam-oak forest: 49<strong>\u2013\
    </strong>63 mg/ g and 12<strong>\u2013</strong> 6 mg/ g in a top 0<strong>\u2013\
    </strong>5 cm and 0<strong>\u2013</strong>50 cm layers respectively. Gradual,\
    \ group-selection and clear felling of hornbeam were attended by significant transformations\
    \ of organoprofile and decrease of TOC content especially in top 15 cm layer.\
    \ However, fractional contents of cold and hot water extractable organic carbon\
    \ increased with depth. The results of this research indicate that among the studied\
    \ scenarios of the forest management, gradual felling caused minimal changes of\
    \ soil organic matters."
