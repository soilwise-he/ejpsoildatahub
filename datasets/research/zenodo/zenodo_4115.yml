  title: Kinetic Modelling and Error Analysis of the Bioremediation of Used Motor
    Oil Contaminated Soil Using Palm Bunch Ash as Stimulant
  abstract: The spillage of petroleum and its derivatives in soil and water has caused
    severe hazards to human health, led to serious environmental problems, caused
    economic loss and lower ground water usage. This research was conducted in order
    to compare the biostimulation potential of palm bunch ash (PBA) for the remediation
    of used motor oil contaminated soil as well as to obtain the best kinetic model
    that fits the experimental data in the treatment cells labelled T1 to T12. D-optimal
    design of response surface methodology of Design expert was used to generate ten
    experimental runs with PBA as numerical factor and pollution level (5% and 10%)
    as categorical factor. Samples were taking from each of the treatment cells for
    analysis of Oil and Grease Content (O&amp;G) and Total Heterotrophic Bacteria
    Count (THBC) at two-week interval. After ten (10) weeks, the results showed T1,
    T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, and T12 exhibited 86.5%, 100%, 79.2%,
    74.5%, 95.5%, 79.2%, 100%, 99.4%, 99.0%, 63.0%, 88.0%, and 58% oil and grease
    degradation, respectively. The R2 values showed that the first and second order
    kinetic models fitted the experimental data. Comparing the results of the error
    analysis of the studied kinetics, it was found that the first order kinetic model
    best fits the degradation of used motor oil in all the treatment cells. The biodegradation
    rate constant values are high for the treatment cells with 5% pollution level
    for the zero, first and second order kinetic models. It was also observed that
    the THBC in all the treatment cells followed the batch growth culture of microorganisms.
    From the results of this work, it can be concluded that the application of PBA
    stimulates the growth of microorganisms that enhanced the consumption of used
    motor oil in the soil. Thus, can be applied to develop an environmentally safe,
    robust, and economically viable treatment strategy for oil contaminated soil.
