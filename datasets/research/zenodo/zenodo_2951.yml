    \ helminthes (STH) affect more than 2 billion people worldwide while the cumulative\
    \ prevalence of STH infection among elementary school children in the Philippines\
    \ was 67%. This study aimed to assess the presence of soil transmitted helminthes\
    \ among school children and determine its association with the family\u2019s demographic\
    \ profile (parents\u2019 highest educational attainment, children\u2019s age and\
    \ sex) and transmission factors (family size, house flooring, water sources, presence\
    \ of latrine, hand washing habit and shoe-wearing habits). The study utilized\
    \ descriptive-cross sectional design and total population sampling. Subjects were\
    \ children aged 3 to 8 years old. Demographic data and risk for transmission factors\
    \ were obtained using a questionnaire while stool samples from 108 children were\
    \ collected and tested for presence of STH using kato-thick technique. The data\
    \ gathered were analyzed using frequency, percentage, and multiple logistic regression.\
    \ A total of 108 children were screened for STH infection and 32 (29.62%) of them\
    \ were positive for Ascaris lumbricoides, 8 (7.40%) were positive for Trichuris\
    \ trichuria and 20 18.51%) were positive for hookworm. The educational attainment\
    \ of the parents has a significant effect in the presence of STH infection.<br>\
