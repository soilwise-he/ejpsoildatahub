  title: Studying the treatment processes of soil samples from radionuclides
  abstract: 'Object of research: Soil samples contaminated with radionuclides and
    processes for treatment of contaminated soil.



    The problem to be solved: Isolation of radionuclides from contaminated soil samples
    by extraction with weak solutions of acids and alkalis.



    Main scientific results: Treatment of soil samples contaminated with uranyl nitrate
    using extraction with weak solutions of nitric and hydrochloric acid, caustic
    sodium and subsequent washing of soil residues with distilled water is effective
    process and leads to a more than tenfold decrease in the content of uranium isotopes
    (U238, U235, U234 and U236) in the soil samples. At the same time, there is a
    decrease in the content of natural radionuclides (Na22, K40, Zn65, Sn113, Sn126)
    in the extracted soil samples. An increase in their content in the extract of
    the analyzed soil samples corresponds to a decrease in their content in the residue
    of the extracted soil samples. The analysis of the values of the decrease in the
    content of natural radionuclides in the soil contaminated with uranyl nitrate
    corresponds to the values of the decrease in their content in the identical soil,
    but not contaminated with uranium isotopes. The combined extraction with weak
    solutions of acids and alkalis leads to the enrichment of the soil with nitrates
    and chlorine-containing compounds.



    The area of practical use of the research results: Subdivisions of the Ministry
    of Emergency Situations and Chemical Troops specializing in the study of emergencies
    and natural disasters can use the results of these studies in the elimination
    of the consequences of global environmental disasters and incidents that pose
    a threat to the life of the civilian population and the personnel of paramilitary
    units.



    Innovative technological product: The proposed method for treatment of soil contaminated
    with radionuclides makes it possible to more than tenfold reduce their concentration
    in the soil.



    Scope of application of an innovative technological product: treatment of contaminated
    soil in areas affected by nuclear tests or accidents at nuclear power plants.'
