  title: Geometric And Material Nonlinear Analysis Of Reinforced Concrete Structure
    Considering Soil-Structure Interaction
  abstract: 'In the present research, a finite element model is

    presented to study the geometrical and material nonlinear behavior of

    reinforced concrete plane frames considering soil-structure

    interaction. The nonlinear behaviors of concrete and reinforcing steel

    are considered both in compression and tension up to failure. The

    model takes account also for the number, diameter, and distribution

    of rebar along every cross section. Soil behavior is taken into

    consideration using four different models; namely: linear-, nonlinear

    Winkler''s model, and linear-, nonlinear continuum model. A

    computer program (NARC) is specially developed in order to

    perform the analysis. The results achieved by the present model show

    good agreement with both theoretical and experimental published

    literature. The nonlinear behavior of a rectangular frame resting on

    soft soil up to failure using the proposed model is introduced for

    demonstration.'
