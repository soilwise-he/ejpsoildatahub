  title: Strengthening the soil organic carbon pool by increasing contributions from
    recalcitrant aliphatic bio(macro)molecules
  abstract: Photosynthetically fixed CO2 is converted into terrestrial bio(macro)molecules
    and sequestered as soil organic matter (SOM) by (bio)chemical and physical stabilization
    processes. SOM is generally divided in arbitrary pools for modeling SOM dynamics.
    Biochemically recalcitrant SOM fractions are enriched with alkyl carbon (C) structures
    and resist decomposition due to intrinsic molecular properties. The proportion
    of alkyl C and the mean age of SOM increase with increase in soil depth. Precursors
    of these recalcitrant bio(macro)molecules such as glycerides, waxes, and terpenoids
    occur in plants, microorganisms and animals. The intrinsic biochemical stability
    of naturally occurring recalcitrant aliphatic biomacromolecules may enhance the
    terrestrial storage of atmospheric CO2. Also, aliphatic macromolecules may be
    formed in soils upon non-enzymatic polymerization of low-molecular-weight lipids.
    In this review we propose that increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by
    land-use and management practices should also include strategies to increase the
    proportion of aliphatic compounds in the belowground biomass. Thus, collaborative
    research is needed to study the fate of plant-, microbial- and animal-derived
    aliphatic C as precursors for stabilized aliphatic SOC fractions, in particular
    in deeper soil horizons.
