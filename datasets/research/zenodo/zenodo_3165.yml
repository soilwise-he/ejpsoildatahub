  title: Effect of liming and organic and inorganic fertilization on soil carbon sequestered
    in macro-and microaggregates in a 17-year old Pinus radiata silvopastoral system
  abstract: 'Agroforestry systems have been recognized as a potential greenhouse gas
    mitigation strategy under the Kyoto Protocol because of their ability to absorb
    carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store carbon mainly in the soil. Soil particle
    size and land management practices are known to have a considerable influence
    on carbon storage in soils. This study evaluated changes in soil chemical and
    physical properties, and quantified and compared the amount of C stored in the
    bulk soil and in three different soil fractions (250e2000, 53e250 and &lt;53 mm)
    at each of four soil depths (0e25, 25e50, 50e75 and 75 e100 cm) in a silvopastoral
    system located on an acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don. Areas of this
    system were subjected ten years ago to one of nine fertilization treatments: three
    different doses of

    sewage sludge or no fertilization, all with or without the addition of lime, and
    mineral fertilizer with no liming. Seventeen years after reforestation and seven
    years after canopy closure, strong gradients with soil depth were found regarding
    soil bulk density, pH and carbon storage. Intense soil management (high doses
    of sewage sludge and liming) generally reduced soil carbon storage, mainly in
    coarse aggregates, but this could be compensated by the increase in tree and pasture
    development observed in soils subject to intermediate sewage sludge doses.'
