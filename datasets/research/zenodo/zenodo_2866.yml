  title: Environmental Assessment of Harmful Elements in Soil and Flora around Electrical
    and Electronic Equipment Waste Dumpsite in Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "<em>The purchase of \u201Ctokumbo\u201D electronics with very short life\
    \ span in Nigeria has resulted in the disposal and burning of large quantity of\
    \ e-waste in some cities in Nigeria. Thus, this study assessed soil and plant\
    \ samples from e-waste dumpsite in Abuluoma, Rivers State, Nigeria. Soil samples\
    \ were collected at 0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80 and 81-100 cm depths at east (E),\
    \ south (S), west (W), north (N) and center (C) of the e-waste dumpsite while\
    \ plant samples (Pennisetum purpureum, Vernonia amygdalina and Amaranthus spinosus)\
    \ were collected around the point soils with the exception of the center of the\
    \ dumpsite. Soil and plant samples were analyzed for harmful elements (Pb, Cd,\
    \ Cu, Hg and Cr). In soil, the value of Cd (1.43\xB10.21 mg/kg) was higher than\
    \ the permissible limits of FAO/WHO. Pb (34.18\xB15.60 mg/kg) was higher than\
    \ the accepted limit by FEPA and Hg (0.4767\xB10.03 mg/kg) was higher than the\
    \ Dutch target value for soil. In plants, the values of Pb (2.70\xB10.10 mg/kg)\
    \ and Cr (2.73\xB10.37 mg/kg) were higher than the permissible limit by FAO/WHO.\
    \ Thus, e-waste released harmful elements in the soil and accumulated in plants.\
    \ The implication is that man, including animals that relied heavily on these\
    \ plant species for food and medicinal purposes will be exposed to bioaccumulation\
    \ of harmful elements. Therefore, it is recommended that Rivers State government\
    \ should carry out serious awareness campaign to dissuade people from accessing\
    \ plants growing on or around e-waste dumpsite for food or medicine.</em>"
