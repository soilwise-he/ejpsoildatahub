  title: Soil Stabilization Using Natural Materials for Highway Construction- An Overview
  abstract: Soil stabilization is defined as the process of improving physical properties
    of soil such as shear strength, permeability, bearing capacity etc., that can
    be done by controlled compaction or addition of suitable admixtures including
    cement, lime, fly ash or providing geotextiles, geo-synthetics etc. The characteristics
    of the subgrade soil depend upon the performance of pavement. Due to this reason,
    the subgrade which is found to be weak is enhanced by suitable and efficient stabilization
    method. From literature it can be found that soil stabilization with natural pozzolana
    activated with lime enhance the properties of soil. This paper presents a review
    of papers on stabilization of soil using natural pozzolanic materials and the
    best combination of such materials to impart good pavement material.
