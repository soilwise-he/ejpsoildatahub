  title: Introduction and adaptive capacity of pittosporum tenuifolium gaertn. in
    conditions of protected soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The aim&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;of the research &ndash;
    to study the complex of biological parameters and physiological specificity of
    plants of P. tenuifolium Gaertn variety as criteria of their adaptive possibilities
    under new conditions. Many researchers considered problems of adaptation under
    conditions of industrial interiors of separate varieties and groups of plants.
    Information, concerning the adaptive potential of varieties of Pittosporum genus
    is very limited. There are only brief reports about biological peculiarities of
    separate varieties of the genus under conditions of introduction (Tumak, Palamar
    2007; Bojko, 2015, 2016, 2018; Larsen, 1979; Tranguillini, 1964).&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;As far as such studies for P. Tenuifolium variety are practically absent,
    problems of studying adaptive abilities of plants of this variety become especially
    urgent. In this connection plants of this variety were chosen as the&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;object&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;of
    the research. The phonological, comparative, morphological and anatomic research&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;methods&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;of
    were used in this work.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;According to&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;the results&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;of phonological
    observations, plants of Pittosporum tenuifolium variety demonstrated adaptive
    changes, characterized by the period of forced rest and variation of terms and
    duration of this period, conditioned by keeping conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The comparative analysis of morphometric parameters of a sprout and leaf
    of plants, growing in interiors with different microclimatic conditions, revealed
    morphological changes, manifested in rates of annual growth, number of young leaves
    and their sizes, internode length. The anatomic construction of a leaf demonstrated
    the thickness increase of the adaxial epidermis by 32,5 %; thickness decrease
    of a leaf by 8 %. There was established the unessential increase of palisade coefficient,
    accompanied by redistribution between spongy and columnar mesophyll to the latter
    side. Adaptation at the physiological-biochemical level was manifested by changes
    of the quantitative content of pigments and their ratios under conditions of industrial
    interior.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The
    assessment of ecological-biological, morphological-anatomical and physiological
    peculiarities of plants of Pittosporum tenuifolium variety revealed adaptive changes,
    characterized by forced rest, variation of occurrence terms and duration of this
    period; morphological-anatomical changes in the sprout and leaf construction;
    change of the quantitative content of pigments and their ratios. The established
    changes favored the resistance increase of Pittosporum tenuifolium plants under
    changed keeping conditions&lt;/p&gt;'
