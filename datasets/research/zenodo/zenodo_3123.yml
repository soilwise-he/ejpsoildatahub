  title: Evaluation of Chemical Properties and Heavy Metals Status of Fluted Pumpkin
    (Telfairia occidentalis) in a Soil along Build up Traffic Road, Port Harcourt,
    Nigeria
  abstract: <strong>The study was conducted along University of Port Harcourt - Choba,
    heavily built traffic road, to evaluate the impact of vehicular activities on
    heavy metals lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) on soil and Fluted Pumpkin.
    Three traverses of 50 meters apart were cut along University of Port Harcourt
    - Choba major road, composite soil samples collected from each of the traverse
    cuts at distances of (0- 5) and 15 meters while the control samples were collected
    from 100 meters away at a depth of 0-15 and 15-30 cm respectively. Plant tissue
    samples (roots, stems and shoots) of <em>Telfairia occidentalis</em> were collected
    from each of the traverses, while control plant sample was taken at 100 meters
    away from the road. A total of 18 composite soil samples and four plant samples
    were collected. All the samples were analyzed for Pb, Cd and Zn using Atomic Absorption
    Spectrophotometer (AAS). Result of the study showed that the content of Pb in
    plant tissue was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in traverse one over control
    and exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 0.3mg/kg Pb in vegetable while in
    traverses 2 and 3, the concentration of Pb falls within the maximum permissible
    limit. Uptake of Zn in the plant tissue were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher
    than control in all the traverse and was within the maximum permissible limit
    of 99.4mg/kg Zn. Cadmium was not detected in traverse 2 and control but the value
    recorded in traverse 1 falls within the maximum permissible level of 0.2mg/kg
    Cd. The study revealed that the three heavy metals in soil samples significantly
    (P&lt;0.05) increased over the control samples in all the traverses sampled. The
    concentrations of all the metals decrease with increase in distance from the road.
    Soil samples collected at 0-5 meters distance away from the traffic area had higher
    concentrations than the samples collected at 15- and 100-meters distances from
    the road side. The study also revealed that the concentrations of the three heavy
    metals decreased with increase in soil depth. Soil chemical properties investigated
    were significantly higher in samples in direct proximity to roadside than the
    control.</strong>
