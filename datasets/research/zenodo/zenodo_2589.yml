  title: 'Soil Thermal Behavior In Different Moisture Condition: An Overview Of Iter
    Project From Laboratory To Field Test Monitoring'
  abstract: 'The thermal properties of soils can be considered one of the most important
    parameters for many engineering projects designing. In detail, the thermal conductivity
    plays a fundamental role when dimensioning ground heat exchangers, especially
    very shallow geothermal (VGS) systems, interesting the first 2 m of depth from
    the ground level. However, the determination of heat transfer in soils is difficult
    to estimate, because depends on several factors, including, among others, particle
    size, density, water content, mineralogy composition, ground temperature, organic
    matter.


    The performance of a VSG system, as horizontal collectors or special forms, is
    strongly correlated to the kind of sediment at disposal and suddenly decreases
    in case of dry-unsaturated conditions in the surrounding soil. Therefore, a better
    knowledge of the relationship between thermal conductivity and water content is
    required for understanding the VSG systems behavior in saturated and unsaturated
    conditions.


    Key challenge of ITER Project, funded by European Union, is to understand how
    to enhance the heat transfer of the sediments surrounding the pipes, taking into
    account the interactions between the soil, the horizontal heat exchangers and
    the surrounding environment.


    In order to obtain reliable data for modelling, an interdisciplinary approach
    is used. In laboratory the physical-thermal properties of more than 15 soil mixtures,
    consisting in (i) natural soil, (ii) pure sand and (iii) mixtures of pure sand
    and clay additives, have been tested under different water content percentages
    and different consolidation degree. Then the same parameters are monitored in
    the project case study, in Eltersdorf, (Germany), where five helix collectors
    are installed in horizontal trenches filled in with five different mixtures already
    tested in laboratory. In addition, a monitoring system allows to record every
    15 minutes, by means of devoted sensors, values related to ground temperature
    (undisturbed, inside and outside each helix), fluid temperature and flow running
    in the collectors, volumetric water content at 20 and 60 cm depth. Moreover, a
    meteorological station provides climatic data acquisition as rainfall, wind speed,
    relative humidity and air temperature.


    The main results achieved until now are useful for future modeling because shed
    new light (i) on the differences between data collected in laboratory and in the
    field and (ii) on the influence of the technical solution adopted in situ to fill
    in the trenches, able to create a non-homogeneous distribution of the soil bodies
    around the helix.'
