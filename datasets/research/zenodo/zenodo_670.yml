  title: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SOIL MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY OR BIOLOGICAL FACTORS IN
    INCREASING SOIL FERTILITY, VARIETY OF NITROGEN FIXING SYSTEMS AND THEIR MAIN CHARACTERISTICS
  abstract: This article discusses the issues of modern soil microbial biotechnology
    or biological factors, their role in improving soil fertility, the variety of
    nitrogen fixation systems and their main characteristics. And also, the management
    of the process of obtaining a productive and high-quality harvest of agricultural
    crops and microbial biochemical processes, as a result of this, in soil science
    has led to the emergence of a new direction in the agricultural direction - soil
    microbial biotechnology. Soil microbbiotechnology - the mass of microorganisms
    in soil conditions serves as the basis for the development of their activities
    in modern methods. The human factor is to increase soil fertility, produce environmentally
    friendly and large products through the accuracy and rational use of microorganisms,
    based on the achievements of soil microbiology.
