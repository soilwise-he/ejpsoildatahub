  title: Asssesment of the Impact of Soil Erosion on Soil Fertility in Sebeya Catchement
    using Rusle Model
  abstract: "In Rwanda more than 745 thousand hectares<br> of potential agricultural\
    \ land are eroded annually in<br> Rwanda. Using the reference year 2021A, more\
    \ than 3<br> million tons (six million tons annually) of crop produce<br> are\
    \ expected to be lost each season, with severe erosion<br> affecting 22,000 tons\
    \ of maize and 15,000 tons of beans.<br> Each season, severe erosion results in\
    \ a total economic<br> loss of 37.9 billion Rwandan francs (RWf) in agricultural<br>\
    \ productivity. The research\u2019s overall objective was to<br> assess the impact\
    \ of soil erosion on soil fertility on sebeya<br> catchement. the specific objectives\
    \ was to analyze to<br> determine amount of soil loss in Sebeya catchment,<br>\
    \ determine the impact soil erosion on soil nutrients loss<br> and estimate the\
    \ value of replacement cost of soil<br> nutrients lost in RWf for period of 2022,\
    \ To achieve<br> these objectives RUSLE model &amp; Geographic<br> Information\
    \ System (GIS) techniques were combined to<br> determine soil erosion .Soil mapdatabase\
    \ was used to<br> determine the quantinty of soil nutrients, whereas<br> ministerial\
    \ price guideline from MINAGRI was used to<br> determine the value (RWf) of fertlizers\
    \ (NPK) to replace<br> the nutrients lost due to soil erosion. This study showed<br>\
    \ that amount of soil loss by combining all the five factors<br> influencing soil\
    \ erosion. After observation and analysis,<br> it revealed that the big losses\
    \ of soil in the sebeya<br> watershed are only found on the surface covered by<br>\
    \ cropland and settlements with an estimated amount<br> &gt;300 t/ha/year, while\
    \ other part of the catchment<br> covered by forest and grasses loose a low quantity\
    \ of soil<br> with an estimation of 0 to 50 t/ha/year, which reconfirms<br> that\
    \ human activities are well managed and structured<br> by rules and guidelines\
    \ given by responsible institutions<br> in charge such as MINAGRI, REMA, RWB,\
    \ etc the<br> sebeya catchment that is facing large amount of soil loss<br> each\
    \ year can be protected efficiently. The study has<br> revealed that erosion is\
    \ seriously taking place in Sebeya<br> watershed, the results shows that, In general,\
    \ the average<br> soil composition of Nitrogen in the sebeya watershed is<br>\
    \ 0.378%, 9.051 mg/l of Phosphorous and 1,205 Cmol/kg<br> of Potassium. Generally,\
    \ Nitrogen is the soil nutrient<br> that is highly lost with an estimated amount\
    \ of 90<br> kg/ha/y. the highest amount of N lost is found in<br> cropland about\
    \ 173.4kg.ha/y while forestland loses the<br> lowest amount of N estimated about\
    \ 14.45kg/ha/y. the<br> highest loss of nutrients amount of P and K are also<br>\
    \ observed in cropland with respective amount of<br> 56.82kg/ha/y and 147.89kg/ha/y.\
    \ These soil nutrients<br> losses have a huge impact on soil fertility reduction,<br>\
    \ because the soil fertility is made at 80% of these three<br> elements (N, P\
    \ and K). This average value of soil loss in<br> the catchment, which is estimated\
    \ to be about 135t/ha/y,<br> naturally indicates 90 kg/ha/y of N, 15kg/ha/y of\
    \ P, and<br> 74kg/ha/y of K. If three or five consecutive years of the<br> same\
    \ soil loss amount occur, soil fertility will be gone,<br> and we will be left\
    \ with a marginal soil unsuitable for<br> cultivation. This study recommends the\
    \ consideration of<br> soil erosion control measures for all government plans\
    \ to<br> increase agricultural productivity through<br> intensification and commercialization\
    \ and suggest to<br> conduct more research for other watershed to know<br> exactly\
    \ the amount for of soil and nutrient loss.<br>"
