  title: Seismic Analysis of Soil-Foundation Interaction under a Bridge Pier Due to
    Chauk Earthquake Excitation of 0.12g to 0.5g
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this study, seismic analysis of soil foundation interaction
    under a bridge pier are studied with different earthquake excitations. In 2016,
    August 25, a magnitude of 6.8 happened near Bagan region. Pakokku Bridge, the
    longest of the bridges over the Irrawaddy, is situated on 37.8 miles from the
    epicentre of 2016 Chauk earthquake. That is why the safety performance of long
    span Bridge Pakokku Bridge especially for the safety of the foundation system
    subjected to soil foundation interaction is necessary to investigate for unexpected
    future seismic excitation. Firstly super structural loadings on the pile cap are
    estimated by using STAAD PRO V8i. And then, p y curves are determined by Reese
    1974 method for the static and National Cooperative Highway Research Program NCHRP
    for dynamic conditions. Based on the development of p y curves, theoretical ultimate
    soil resistance pcr and pcd due to wedge and flow failure are determined to produce
    critical depth xcr. After that, finite element software ABAQUS is used for the
    analysis of soil foundation interaction under a bridge pier in static condition.
    And then, the behaviour of soil foundation interaction under a bridge pier is
    carried out due to Chauk earthquake. In this study, the behaviour of soil foundation
    interaction such as deflections and settlements are produced. According to the
    analysis results in static condition, it is found that the vertical and horizontal
    displacements at the pile tip are 2.28mm and 0.14mm respectively. In dynamic condition,
    the vertical and horizontal displacements at the pile tip are 3mm and 2.94mm are
    found at 0.12g. After that, maximum ground acceleration of 0.5g is 14.5mm and
    2.94mm in horizontal and vertical displacement of pile tip. Maximum shear stress
    and strain are found out the base of the pile cap. Finally it is found that the
    soil foundation interaction under a bridge pier during earthquake motions presented
    in this study is reliable and reasonable with the limitation of AASHTO Standard
    Specifications for Highway Bridges. Zin May Hnin | Nyan Myint Kyaw | Kyaw Kyaw
