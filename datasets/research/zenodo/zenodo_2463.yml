  title: Analysis of Soil Nutrient Status Under Different Cropping Types in Karu Local
    Government Area of Nasarawa State Nigeria
  abstract: Soil plays an important role in the growth of Maize, Cassava, and Guinea
    corn. Achieving increasing yield in crops can be supported by soil suitability
    study. Farming in the study area is characterized by its poor productivity. Several
    factors related to soil fertility limit agricultural production. This study analyzed
    the soil nutrient status under different cropping types in Karu LGA of Nasarawa
    State. A total of nine Soil samples were collected at 40intervalsal on agricultural
    lands on which these crops area cultivated, while one sample was also collected
    50m away from the cultivated lands to serve as the control for the study. The
    samples were collected at a depth of 0-15cm and 15-30cm, one kg of soil samples
    was collected and placed inside well-labeled plastic bags and taken to the laboratory
    for routine analysis of properties such as soil textural, total porosity, bulk
    density, electrical conductivity, exchangeable acidity, base saturation, pH, OM,
    OC, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, CEC. The study reveals that most of the chemical properties
    in the study area are deficient. The result shows that total nitrogen has a mean
    of 0.01meg/kg and 0.02meg/kg, phosphorous 3.56Meg/kg, 3.72meg/kg and 3.62meg/kg,
    potassium 0.03meg/kg, 0.04meq/kg and 0.01meg/kg, sodium 0.32meg/kg, 0.31meg/kg
    and 0.33meg/kg, exchangeable acidity 0.55meg/kg, 0.50meg/kg and 0.60meg/kg, Calcium
    2.62meg/kg, 2.57meg/kg and 2.71meg/kg, Magnesium 1.81meg/kg, 2.15meg/kg and 2.45meq/kg
    and CEC 5.57cmol/kg and soil pH in the study area range from slightly acidic to
    moderately acidic, in maize, cassava and guinea corn cultivated soils respectively.
    The, therefore, recommends the following. As a way of ensuring agricultural sustainability
    in the study area, it is recommended to increase and sustain the use of organic
    manure is applied to maintain soil fertility not only under cultivated soil but
    even in soils under fallow conditions.
