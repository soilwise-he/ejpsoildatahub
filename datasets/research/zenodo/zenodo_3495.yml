  title: Screening Of Bacteriocin Producing Bacteria From Soil Sample Against Staphylococcus
    Aureus
  abstract: "In industrialized countries 30 percentage population suffer from food\
    \ borne disease yearly. Food processing runs the risk of significant economic\
    \ loss annually due to food spoilage resulting from microbial contamination. Although\
    \ chemical preservatives may provide a solution, the use of such preservatives\
    \ is generally avoided, since they have negative consequences for human health.\
    \ Moreover, the problems associated with food safety especially of microbial contamination\
    \ appear to be alarmingly high. To address the increasing bacterial resistance\
    \ to conventional antibiotics, bacteriocins are now considered as alternative\
    \ antimicrobials for the treatment of human and possibly animal infections. Further,\
    \ processed foods without chemical preservatives are in demand by consumers. Research\
    \ in natural antimicrobial agents such as bacteriocins becomes inevitable. Members\
    \ of the Bacillus group are good producers of antimicrobial substances such as\
    \ peptide and lipopeptide antibiotics, as well as bacteriocins. Interestingly,\
    \ Bacillus represents an alternative genus for the identification of bacteriocins\
    \ because it includes many industrial species and has a history of safe use in\
    \ the food industry. In the present study screening of bacterial isolates for\
    \ bacteriocin production were screened from soil samples, from them thirty bacterial\
    \ isolates obtained were tested for the bacteriocin activity against indicator\
    \ bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Among them MA5 designated strain found to be\
    \ Gram\u2019s positive rod bacteria. Based on the phenotypical characterization\
    \ identified as Bacillus sp. and exhibited antagonistic activity against S. aureus.\
    \ The antagonistic bacterial strain MA5 found to inhibit the growth of S. aureus.\
    \ Antibacterial activity was identified by agar well diffusion assay. The sensitivity\
    \ of the indicator strains were estimated based on the inhibition zones. To estimate\
    \ the molecular weight of the bacteriocin, SDS-PAGE was performed and the protein\
    \ in the active fraction was resolved and the molecular weight of the single protein\
    \ band that exhibited antimicrobial activity was estimated to be 10 kDa."
