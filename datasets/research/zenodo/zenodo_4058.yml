  title: Production of Organic Solvent Tolerant Hydrolytic Enzymes (Amylase and Protease)
    by Bacteria Isolated from Soil of a Dairy Farm
  abstract: Organic solvent tolerant amylases and proteases of microbial origin are
    in great demand for their application in transglycosylation of water-insoluble
    flavanoids and in peptide synthesizing reaction in organic media. Most of the
    amylases and proteases are unstable in presence of organic solvent. In the present
    work two different bacterial strains M-11 and VP-07 were isolated from the soil
    sample of a dairy farm in Delhi, India, for the efficient production of extracellular
    amylase and protease through their screening on starch agar (SA) and skimmed milk
    agar (SMA) plates, respectively. Both the strains (M-11 and VP-07) were identified
    based on morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. After
    analysis through Ez-Taxon software, the strains M-11 and VP-07 were found to have
    maximum pairwise similarity of 98.63% and 100% with Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum
    BGSC 3A28 and Bacillus anthracis ATCC 14578 and were therefore identified as Bacillus
    sp. UKS1 and Bacillus sp. UKS2, respectively. Time course study of enzyme activity
    and bacterial growth has shown that both strains exhibited typical sigmoid growth
    behavior and maximum production of amylase (180 U/ml) and protease (78 U/ml) by
    these strains (UKS1 and UKS2) was commenced during stationary phase of growth
    at 24 and 20 h, respectively. Thereafter, both amylase and protease were tested
    for their tolerance towards organic solvents and were found to be active as well
    stable in p-xylene (130% and 115%), chloroform (110% and 112%), isooctane (119%
    and 107%), benzene (121% and 104%), n-hexane (116% and 103%) and toluene (112%
    and 101%, respectively). Owing to such properties, these enzymes can be exploited
    for their potential application in industries for organic synthesis.
