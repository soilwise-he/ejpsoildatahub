  title: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISK WORKING BODIES THAT WORK THE SOIL AND THEM
    WORKING BETWEEN THE GARDEN ROW
  abstract: <em>The latter advantage becomes especially relevant when working in stony
    soils and not uprooted forest clearings. Disks with cutouts along the periphery
    are called "chamomile". Thus, the presence of structural elements in the form
    of asymmetric cutouts on the edge disk allows you to capture and fix the stems
    of vegetation in the soil, to ensure their cutting.</em><em> Tines with convex-concave
    disks are fixed on front side of bars, throughout the entire width so as to define
    paired rows. Disks are positioned for rotation and adjusting an angle of attack.
    Pins of disks are inclined at an acute angle to ground plane which is closer to
    horizontal plane so that convex side is facing ground surface. In each subsequent
    row, disks are offset transverse to disks of previous row by value equal to quotient
    of division of distance between disks by number of rows.</em>
