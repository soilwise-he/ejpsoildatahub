  title: Biochemical soil activity in Taxus baccata L. stands in forest reserves and
    managed forests
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of these studies was to estimate the enzymatic activity
    and chemical properties of soils of &lt;em&gt;Taxus baccata&lt;/em&gt; L. stands
    in selected forest reserves as well as in managed forest stands that do not belong
    to reserves. Furthermore, I compared the soil fertility of both types of forest
    stand using a biochemical soil quality indicator. The studies were conducted in
    the following reserves: &lsquo;Bogdanieckie Cisy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cisy Rokickie&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;Cisy Tychowskie&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cisy w Czarnem&rsquo;, as&lt;br /&gt;

    well as in managed forest stands with the same soil and habitat type as the above-mentioned
    reserves.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Analyses showed a lower activity of urease, asparaginase, acid phosphatase
    and dehydrogenase in soils of the managed forests than in soils of the reserves.
    The soil nutrient availability given by the total organic carbon, nitrogen, and
    alkaline cation content as well as soil sorption capacity were significantly lower
    outside the forest reserves. Chemical and biochemical parameters were used to
    calculate a biochemical index of soil fertility. The index was higher for soil
    in forest reserves than for soil in managed forest stands located outside reserves.
    The result held true regardless of the biochemical parameters used in calculation.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;As has been shown in previous studies on protected areas with no cultivation
    that are largely influenced by natural processes, biochemical indices can be very
    useful for comparative analyses aiming at estimating soil quality or the reaction
    of soil to external factors, both natural and anthropogenic.&lt;/p&gt;'
