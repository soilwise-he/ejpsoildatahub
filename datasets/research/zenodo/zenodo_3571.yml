  title: 'Constitutive model for soil amplification of ground shaking: Parameter calibration,
    comparisons, validation'
  abstract: "A phenomenological constitutive model developed by Gerolymos and Gazetas\
    \ (2005) for the one-dimensional nonlinear ground response analysis of soil deposits\
    \ is modified, calibrated, and verified in this paper. The small number of parameters\
    \ renders the model easily implemented, yet powerful, able of efficiently reproducing\
    \ the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of various soils and simultaneously generating\
    \ realistic shear modulus reduction and damping ratio curves. Model is calibrated\
    \ against three sets of widely-used published G-\u03B3 / \u03BE-\u03B3 curves\
    \ and a library of parameter values is assembled for utilization of the new model\
    \ to analyze 1-D seismic soil response problems. The model and the explicit finite\u2013\
    difference code for the integration of the wave equations necessary to obtain\
    \ the dynamic response of soil deposits are then validated against more sophisticated\
    \ constitutive models and numerical tools, and experimental data from centrifuge\
    \ tests. The sufficiently close agreement of calculated results and experimental\
    \ measurements gives confidence for the use of the proposed model."
