  title: Total Nucleic Acid Extraction From Soil
  abstract: "Authors: Roey Angel \n\n### Abstract\n\nThe following protocol is intended\
    \ for the simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from various soil samples along\
    \ with suggestions on how to tweak the protocol for soil with higher humic content.\
    \ The protocol has been used by many and results in very high yields of nucleic\
    \ acids, typically much more than commercial kits. For buffers and solutions used\
    \ in this protocol, please see accompanying document Buffers and Solutions for\
    \ TNA Extractions.pdf.\n\n### Introduction\n \nThis protocol is a general procedure\
    \ for the co-extraction of DNA and RNA from soils. The procedure results in very\
    \ high yields of nucleic acids and is suitable for all downstream enzymatic reactions.\
    \ The protocol has been published in: [Angel et al. 2012](http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v6/n4/abs/ismej2011141a.html)\n\
    \n**NA extraction considerations**\n\n- **RNA handling**: as RNA is very sensitive\
    \ to both chemical and enzymatic degradation meticulous measures of precaution\
    \ must be taken. The use of DEPC and DEPC-treated water is not recommended since\
    \ the substance is toxic and its application was found to be nearly unnecessary\
    \ (see: http://www.ambion.com/techlib/tb/tb_178.html). Instead, I recommend to\
    \ simply work with clean, preferably baked, glassware (3h at 180 \xB0C), to clean\
    \ surfaces and spatulas with RNase eliminating solutions (such as RNaseZap\xAE\
    ), and to use fresh and clean reagents for the preparation of the different buffers\
    \ and solutions. As a general rule, work with RNA should be quick, precise, and\
    \ tubes should be kept on ice. In my experience, this is much more important than\
    \ any attempt to eliminate all RNases from apparatus and solutions. One should\
    \ also bear in mind that soil samples contain infinitely more RNases than any\
    \ contamination which might exist in the buffers or the apparatus. The only exceptions\
    \ to this are the PEG Precipitation Solution, the Low TE Buffer, and the RNA storage\
    \ solution. Since these are used to store RNA for relatively long periods of incubation\
    \ extra care must be taken during their preparation to ensure highest degree of\
    \ purity. For the preparation of the PEG Precipitation Solution I simply weigh\
    \ everything into a Schott Bottle and add approximately the right amount of water\
    \ as I prefer to be somewhat inaccurate in the concentrations than to have to\
    \ transfer the solution between vessels and risk contamination.\n\n- **Selection\
    \ of extraction buffer**: The TNS buffer used in this protocol is based on The\
    \ TNS extraction buffer is based on the one used by [Henckel et al](http://aem.asm.org/content/65/5/1980.short.using).\
    \ 1999 TNS buffer results in higher RNA yields and more intact rRNA (more intact\
    \ 23S band). However, TNS tends to carry much more humic substances into the nucleic\
    \ acids phase compared to TNC buffer which could make it ineffective for soils\
    \ with high organic matter content.\n\n- **Use of phenol in the bead beating process**:\
    \ the use of phenol increases the yield up to 4 times compared with the phenol\
    \ free option, but also increases the carryover of humic substances. If you choose\
    \ not to add phenol simply double the amount of extraction buffer added (1.0 ml\
    \ in total)\n\n- **RNAlater\xAE**: if samples were stored in an RNAlater\xAE solution\
    \ or similar substance it is necessary to remove it before proceeding with RNA\
    \ extraction. Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 rpm for 1 min and pipette the supernatant.\
    \ Add 1 ml of PB pH 8.0, vortex the sample for 10 s to make sure the soil is washed\
    \ by the buffer, and centrifuge it again at 10,000 rpm for 1 min Remove the supernatant\
    \ completely and proceed with normal extraction.\n\n- **Extra dry soil**: for\
    \ extra dry soil (&lt; 5% WC) it is recommended to add some (up to 250 \xB5l)\
    \ PB pH 8.0 in addition to the usual amount of 375 \xB5l during the first bead\
    \ beating processing. The reason is that in dry soils some of the extraction buffer\
    \ is inevitably absorbed in the soil and cannot be recovered afterwards. This\
    \ can lead to low recovery volumes from the bead beating process which could make\
    \ it hard to separate the aqueous phase from the phenolic phase and eventually\
    \ result in reduced yields. After the first processing the soil is wet enough\
    \ and no further additions are required.\n\n- **pH of the extraction buffers**:\
    \ The phenol and the extraction buffers used in this protocol are all at pH 8.0.\
    \ It has been shown that performing the extraction at pH 5.5 yields significantly\
    \ fewer humic substances in the extractant and is recommended for soils rich in\
    \ organic material. Using such low pH, however, will also significantly decrease\
    \ the amount of DNA yield (while not affecting RNA yield). Low pH extraction might\
    \ therefore not be suitable if DNA is also to be analysed. For more information\
    \ see [Mettel et al](http://aem.asm.org/content/76/17/5995.short). 2010.\n\n-\
    \ **Number of bead beating processing**: for most soil types (especially if they\u2019\
    re not too clayish), one time processing should be sufficient to obtain enough\
    \ NA for further applications. The following two repetitions are meant not only\
    \ to increase yields but also to reduce the bias associated with the susceptibility\
    \ of different cell types to lysis. [Feinstein et al. 2009](http://aem.asm.org/content/75/16/5428.short)\
    \ found that DNA extraction yields kept increasing even after the 6th bead beating\
    \ repetition, and that community structure differed somewhat in each repetition.\n\
    \n- **Amount of crude extract to use for RNA purification**: this depends mostly\
    \ on the colour of the crude extract, and its quantity and purity as measured\
    \ spectrophotometrically. In addition, the decision should take into account the\
    \ final volume of the RNA .Between 20-100 \xB5l may be used depending on colour,\
    \ purity and amount of NA.\n\n- **Quantification**: it\u2019s not possible to\
    \ precisely quantify total NA using a spectrophotometer because DNA and RNA require\
    \ different multiplication factors, but this should nevertheless give a sensible\
    \ estimation. More precise quantifications of DNA and RNA can be obtained using\
    \ Invitrogen\u2019s PicoGreen\u2122 and RiboGreen\u2122, respectively. Impurities,\
    \ especially humic substances, greatly interfere with spectrophotometeric quantification,\
    \ though PicoGreen\u2122 and RiboGreen\u2122 tend to be less sensitive.\n\n- **Three\
    \ steps purification procedure**: purification with phenol/chloroform and then\
    \ chloroform should yield pure enough samples for most applications. Adding an\
    \ additional purification step with only phenol prior to the phenol/chloroform\
    \ purification (step 8) will ensure high TNA purity while only minimally compromising\
    \ the yield.\n\n### Reagents \n\nFor recipes of the solutions which need to be\
    \ prepared see: Buffers and Solutions for TNA Extractions.pdf under \u2018Figures\u2019\
    .\n\n1. TNS or TNC extraction buffer .\n- Phosphate buffer (PB) pH 8.0 or pH 5.5.\n\
    - PEG precipitation solution.\n- Phenol for molecular biology, TE saturated (pH\
    \ ~7.8).\n- Phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25:24:1 for molecular biology.\n\
    - Chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24:1 for molecular biology.\n- Glycogen (20 mg/ml).\n\
    - 75% ethanol made with RNase free water, stored at -20 \xB0C. \n\n### Equipment\n\
    \n1. Bead beater suitable for screw-top 2 mL tubes.\n- Ice box.\n- Standard 2\
    \ ml polypropylene tubes.\n- 2 ml Non-Stick tubes (e.g. from Ambion).\n- 2 ml\
    \ screw top tubes.\n- Optional: Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime).\n- 0.1 mm glass\
    \ beads or Lysing Matrix E (MP bio).\n- Optional: MicroSpin S-200 HR (GE).\n\n\
    ### Procedure\n\n**Before you begin**\n\n1. Prepare all solutions, filter and\
    \ autoclave them.\n- Clean all surfaces and centrifuges with an RNase eliminating\
    \ solution.\n- Prepare beads tubes by pouring 0.7 g (one full PCR tube) of 0.1\
    \ mm glass beads to the screw top tube.\n- For each sample prepare in a rack:\
    \ 1 beads tube, 4 standard 2 ml tubes and 2 Ambion\u2019s Non-Stick 2 ml tubes.\
    \ Label the beads tube and the Non-Stick tubes with stickers and the standard\
    \ 2 ml tubes with a marker.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1. Weigh 0.5 g (0.3-0.7 g) soil\
    \ to a silica beads tube and place tube on ice.\n- Add 375 \xB5l of PB, 125 \xB5\
    l of TNS or TNC and 500 \xB5l of TE saturated phenol.\n- Immediately place tubes\
    \ in a bead beater and process for 30 s at 6.5 m s-1.\n- Chill on ice for 10 s.\n\
    - Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 min.\n- Transfer the supernatant (extraction\
    \ buffer and the phenolic phase) to a fresh 2 ml tube (or to a Phase Lock Gel\
    \ tube), retain the silica beads tubes.\n- Repeat steps 2-6 using the same silica\
    \ beads tubes. If there is not enough space in the tube for all the reagents,\
    \ decrease the phenol volume (down to 200 \xB5l) to avoid overflow. For the second\
    \ extraction use fresh 2 ml tubes to collect the supernatant in step 6 while for\
    \ the third extraction transfer only the aqueous phase and divide it between the\
    \ tubes from the previous extractions to have equal volumes.\n- Add approximately\
    \ 800 \xB5l phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 25:24:1 to each of the tubes containing\
    \ the extractant, 2 ml total volume.\n- Mix phases by hand or using a vortex.\
    \ Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 min.\n- Transfer the supernatant from each tube\
    \ to fresh 2 ml tubes, and add 1 vol. chloroform/ isoamylalcohol 24:1. Mix phases\
    \ by hand or using a vortex. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 min.\n- Transfer supernatant\
    \ from each tube to fresh 2 ml non-stick silicon tubes.\n- Add to each tube 1\
    \ \xB5l of glycogen and 1 ml PEG Precipitation Solution (twice the extractant\u2019\
    s volume).\n- Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 60 min at 4o C.\n- Remove as much as\
    \ possible from the supernatant. Be careful not to pipette the pellet with the\
    \ liquid.\n- Wash once with 1 ml of ice cold 75% EtOH, invert the tube several\
    \ times. Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 20 min.\n- Remove as much as possible from\
    \ the supernatant first using a 1 ml tip, spin down the remaining drops in the\
    \ tube, and remove them with a 100 \xB5l tip. Once again, be careful not to pipette\
    \ the pellet with the liquid.\n- Leave tubes open at room temperature for no more\
    \ than 5 min (preferably under flame or a biological hood) in order to evaporate\
    \ the remaining ethanol (note: pellets might not be completely dry at this point).\
    \ Alternatively, pellets can be dried under a filtered stream of N2.\n- Resuspend\
    \ the pellets in 100 \xB5l Low TE Buffer and combine both subsamples from each\
    \ sample into one of the non-stick tubes.\n- Optional: to remove colour and some\
    \ humic substances purify the extract using MicroSpin S-200 HR (GE Healthcare)\
    \ the following way:\n  - a. Resuspend the resin in a column by vortexing.\n \
    \ - b. Loosen the cap by a quarter twist, place column in a collection tube and\
    \ centrifuge 1 min at 735 \xD7 g.\n  - c. Place column in a fresh 1.5 ml tube,\
    \ apply 25-100 \xB5l of sample to the resin.\n  - d. Centrifuge 2 min at 735 \xD7\
    \ g.\n- Run 5-10 \xB5l on agarose gel to evaluate NA quality.\n- Quantify total\
    \ NA spectrophotometrically (dilute 1:10 in Low TE buffer before measuring) or\
    \ DNA using PicoGreen\u2122 (Invitrogen).\n- Depending on quality and quantity,\
    \ aliquot 10-100 \xB5l for RNA purification.\n- Optional: aliquot 10-100 \xB5\
    l for DNA purification. \n\n### Anticipated Results\n \nHigh yields of high quality\
