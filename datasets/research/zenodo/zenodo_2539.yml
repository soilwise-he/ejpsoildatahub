  title: Farming Practices, Soil Nutrient Condition and Crop Yield in Ihuo Community,
    Ahoada East Local Government Area, Rivers State
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study was designed to examine the traditional\
    \ farming practice of slash and burn and soils in the Ihuo community in Ahoada\
    \ East Local Government Area of Rivers State. To achieve this feet, issues of\
    \ concern were raised to ascertain the prevalent farming practice in the area,\
    \ determine the soil condition of slash and burn traditional farms in the area\
    \ using soil physical parameters and macro-nutrients. Determine the soil conditions\
    \ of an unfarmed forest in the area using soil physical parameters and macronutrients.\
    \ The study further examined differences in the soil conditions of the slash and\
    \ burned traditional farms and the untouched forest in the area and evaluated\
    \ the people\u2019s view of crop production using the slash and burn traditional\
    \ farming practices over the years. The study found that slash and burn standard\
    \ farming practice is a significant practice adopted by rural farmers for land\
    \ preparation before planting. The study also showed that nutrient values and\
    \ soil conditions vary between the burnt farmland and the untouched forest. Crop\
    \ yield was found to be is affected by slash and burn traditional farming practices.\
    \ The study recommended the discouragement of slash and burn conventional farming\
    \ practices and the adoption of alley farming, and the need for enlightenment\
    \ programs to enhance sustainable farming techniques at all levels to achieve\
    \ food security. \xA9 International Journal of Ground Sediment &amp; Water, \xA9\
