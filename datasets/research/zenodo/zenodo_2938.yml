  title: Concentration and Bioaccumulation of Toxic Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic
    Hydrocarbons in Soil and Lumbricus Terrestris in Kolo Creek, Niger Delta, Nigeria
  abstract: "The concentration of toxic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\
    \ (PAHs) in soil, and their bioaccumulation in Lumbricus terrestris in areas around\
    \ Kolo Creek, Niger Delta, Nigeria were evaluated in this study. 12 soil samples\
    \ were collected from 4 sites, while Lumbricus terrestris were also collected\
    \ from areas where soil samples were obtained. Toxic metals were extracted using\
    \ aqua regia and quantified with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer.\
    \ Extraction of PAHs was achieved by liquid-liquid soxhlet extraction, and quantified\
    \ with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF)\
    \ for both toxic metals and PAHs were calculated. The results obtained in this\
    \ study showed that the concentration of all studied toxic metals were within\
    \ their respective regulatory limits in soil. The BAF for all toxic metals were\
    \ less than 1 in all sites, indicating minimal bioaccumulation in Lumbricus terrestris.\
    \ The \u01A916 PAHs ranged from 7.30 to 77.7 mg kg-1 and 1.10 to 4.75 mg kg-1\
    \ in soil and Lumbricus terrestris across the 4 sites, respectively. The BAF values\
    \ for individual PAHs were less than 1 in all sites, which indicated that PAH\
    \ congeners were either not bioaccumulated or accumulated PAH congeners were metabolized.\
    \ Hence, analysis of PAHs metabolites in Lumbricus terrestris is recommended."
