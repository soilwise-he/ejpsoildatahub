  title: 'A Statistical Model For The Geotechnical Parameters Of Cement-Stabilised
    Hightown''S Soft Soil: A Case Stufy Of Liverpool, Uk'
  abstract: This study investigates the effect of two important parameters (length
    of curing period and percentage of the added binder) on the strength of soil treated
    with OPC. An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic content
    was used in this study. This soft soil was treated with different percentages
    of a commercially available cement type 32.5-N. laboratory experiments were carried
    out on the soil treated with 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12% OPC by the dry weight to
    determine the effect of OPC on the compaction parameters, consistency limits,
    and the compressive strength. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test was carried
    out on cement-treated specimens after exposing them to different curing periods
    (1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 90 days). The results of UCS test were used to develop a
    non-linear multi-regression model to find the relationship between the predicted
    and the measured maximum compressive strength of the treated soil (qu). The results
    indicated that there was a significant improvement in the index of plasticity
    (IP) by treating with OPC; IP was decreased from 20.2 to 14.1 by using 12% of
    OPC; this percentage was enough to increase the UCS of the treated soil up to
    1362 kPa after 90 days of curing. With respect to the statistical model of the
    predicted qu, the results showed that the regression coefficients (R2) was equal
    to 0.8534 which indicates a good reproducibility for the constructed model.
