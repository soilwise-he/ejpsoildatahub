  title: The Effect Of Temperature And Nh3 Concentration On Nh3 Oxidising Archaea
    And Bacteria In Agricultural Soil.
  abstract: The aim of this study was to study the effect of temperature and NH4+concentration
    on NH4+oxidising activity and community structures of bacterial and archaeal NH4+oxidisers
    in Scottish soil. Microcosms were amended with low and high NH4+ concentration
    and incubated at five different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35oC) for 28
    days. Nitrification activity, AOA and AOB growth increased with temperature and
    AOB growth were greatest at 30oC in microcosms incubated with high NH4+ concentration,
    while AOA growth was detected, irrespective of soil NH4+ concentration and at
    all incubation temperature except 35oC. AOB growth was detected at 35oC even in
    microcosms incubated with low NH4+ concentration. There was a greater change in
    the community structure of AOA and AOB with an increase in temperature only. This
    probably suggests that NH4+ oxidation was dominated by AOA at low concentration
    between 15 - 30 oC and at 35 oC AOB were able to grow when the competition with
    AOA for NH4+ in soil was relieved by high temperature (35 oC) that inhibited AOA
    growth. The differences in AOA and AOB responses to temperature could suggest
    an additional niche differentiating factor between AOA and AOB. Temperature but
    not NH4+ is one of the key environmental factors responsible for changes in the
    relative abundance and community structure of AOA and AOB in soil.
