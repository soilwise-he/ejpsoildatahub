  title: DETERIORATION OF WATER AND SOIL QUALITY ALONG YAMUNA RIVERBED IN THE NATIONAL
    CAPITAL REGION
  abstract: Yamuna, a river, revered by millions of people, is loosing its purity
    and serenity as it flows along the historical cities of Panipat, Delhi, Mathura,
    Agra , and Kanpur to finally converge with the Ganges in Allahabad. It is the
    lifeline of the capital of India, but is struggling against a seemingly lost battle
    for its survival. It is a bed for receiving wastes from Industries, power plants,
    drainage, municipal garbage, e-wastes, agriculture etc. which makes it unsuitable
    for any purpose. The soil samples from the bank of Yamuna river at various sites
    were collected and their chemical parameters- namely pH, conductivity, salinity,
    organic matter, calcium carbonate content, water-soluble sulphate, water-soluble
    chloride, cation exchange capacity were analysed. Samples were also analysed for
    Ca, Mg, Na, K and heavy metal detection of Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Mn and Cr was carried
    out by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results show large deviation from
    the healthy soil indicating huge amount of pollutants leading to deterioration
    of water and soil quality
