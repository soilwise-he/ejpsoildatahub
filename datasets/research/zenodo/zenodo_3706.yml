  title: 'Effects of Landslides and Soil Settlements on the Built Environment: A Meta-analysis'
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nOne of the most important problems that Civil and Geotechnical\
    \ Engineers\u2019 Society faces, stand for the settlements due to inconsistent\
    \ permeability of soil, not only in building projects but also in constructions\
    \ in general. Settlements observed are usually a function of both the imposed\
    \ load and the characteristics of the foundation soil [1]. On each slope, the\
    \ difference in level and in slope gradient in combination with the gravitational\
    \ forces and the possible presence of groundwater, create shear stresses inside\
    \ the slopes, which are countered by the shear resistance of the soil. When the\
    \ developing stresses overcome shear resistance, then they lead to a fracture\
    \ of the slopes and to a landslide. The instability of slopes, leading to the\
    \ displacement of soil mass downstream known as landslide, constitutes a significant\
    \ risk to human activities and is often accompanied by the destruction of property,\
    \ injury and loss of life. So, landslides and soil retreats are of the most significant\
    \ catastrophic phenomena recorded on the surface of the earth. The above-mentioned\
    \ phenomena can be a major threat not only to the social and economic fabric,\
    \ i.e. the quality of life of a region, but also for the environment (basin-filling\
    \ reservoirs, clogging of streams \u2013 rivers, road surface retreat, destruction\
    \ of forests and ecosystems, etc.). The main objective of this work is to investigate\
    \ the environmental impact of the failure of the slopes and soil settlements,\
    \ particularly in cases observed in Greece, as well as the prevention and stabilization\
    \ measures against landslides and loose soils, mainly through mild environmental\
    \ interventions."
