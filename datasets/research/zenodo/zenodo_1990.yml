  title: Influence of Thirumanimutharu river water on soil properties of Veerapandi
    Block villages of Salem district
  abstract: 'Department of Chemistry, Government Arts College (Autonomous), Salem-636
    007, Tamilnadu, India <em>E-mail</em> : parupalani@yahoo.co.in Soil Testing Laboratory,
    Salem-636 007, Tamilnadu, India A detailed soil survey was conducted to estimate
    Thirumanimutharu river basin of Salem district Veerapandi block that is polluted
    by effluent discharge. The soil analytical results of villages revealed that the
    soil is tending towards alkalinity both in surface and subsurface. However, the
    accumulation of soluble salts (EC) in the soil is quite normal. Accounting for
    96 per cent of the area, since the physical condition of the most soil series
    favours the natural way of leaching out the salts, which require adequate measures
    for their reclamation. The occurrence of saline alkaline lands is quite negligible.'
