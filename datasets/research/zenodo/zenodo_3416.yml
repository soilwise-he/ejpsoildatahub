  title: Laboratory Investigation Of Expansive Soil Stabilized With Calcium Chloride
  abstract: 'Chemical stabilization is a technique commonly used<br>

    to improve the expansive soil properties. In this regard, an attempt<br>

    has been made to evaluate the influence of Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)<br>

    stabilizer on the engineering properties of expansive soil. A series of<br>

    laboratory experiments including consistency limits, free swell,<br>

    compaction, and shear strength tests were performed to investigate<br>

    the effect of CaCl2 additive with various percentages 0%, 2%, 5%,<br>

    10% and 15% for improving expansive soil. The results obtained<br>

    shows that the increase in the percentage of CaCl2decreased the<br>

    liquid limit and plasticity index leading to significant reduction in the<br>

    free swell index. This, in turn, increased the maximum dry density<br>

    and decreased the optimum moisture content which results in greater<br>

    strength. The unconfined compressive strength of soil stabilized with<br>

    5% CaCl2 increased approximately by 50% as compared to virgin<br>

    soil. It can be concluded that CaCl2 had shown promising influence<br>

    on the strength and swelling properties of expansive soil, thereby<br>

    giving an advantage in improving problematic expansive soil.'
