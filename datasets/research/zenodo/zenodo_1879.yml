  title: Zn pasture and soil concentrations in Quercus rubra L. silvopastoral systems
    fertilised with sewage sludge
  abstract: 'When sewage sludge is used as fertiliser it is important to apply an
    adequate dose of this residue to avoid the accumulation and leaching of heavy
    metals as Zn through soil profile. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate
    the effects of different dose of municipal sewage sludge (100, 200 and 400 kg
    total N ha-1) on the total and available Zn concentration at different soil depths
    (0-25 and 25-50 cm) and the Zn levels of pasture compared to control treatment
    (no fertilisation) in a silvopastoral system under Quercus rubra L. in Galicia
    (Spain). The results obtained in this study showed that the use of sewage sludge
    as fertiliser increased the concentration of Zn in the first 25 cm of soil and
    in the pasture, mainly when high doses of sewage sludge were applied (400 kg total
    N ha-1), but never exceeded the maximums set by Spanish regulations and did not
    cause harmful effects on plants and

    animals.'
