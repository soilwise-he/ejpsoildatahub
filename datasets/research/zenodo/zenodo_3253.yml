  title: Responses of Bambara groundnut [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.] to Phosphate
    Fertilizer Rates and Plant Spacing and Effects on Soil Nutrient Statues in a Degraded
    Tropical Ultisol Agbani  Enugu South East Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The agronomic practices such as plant spacing and phosphate\
    \ fertilizer requirements for the cultivation of Bambara groundnut [&lt;em&gt;Vigna\
    \ subterranea &lt;/em&gt;(L.) Verdc.] have not yet been fully determined in Agbani\
    \ agro ecology South east Nigeria. Field trials were conducted in 2015 and 2016\
    \ planting season at the Teaching and Research Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture\
    \ and Natural Resources Management, Enugu State University of Science and Technology,\
    \ Agbani as a 4 x 3 factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with\
    \ three replications. The treatments were four rates of single super phosphate\
    \ fertilizer (0 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 25 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;,\
    \ 50 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;and 75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ and three plant spacing regimes (intra and inter row spacing) 10 cm x 45 cm\
    \ (222,222 plants hectare&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) 5 cm x 45 cm (148,148 plants\
    \ hectare&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 20 cm x 45 cm (111,111 plants hectare&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).\
    \ Soil samples were collected from the top soil at a depth of 0 to 15 cm before\
    \ planting, four and eight weeks after planting. The obtained results showed that\
    \ Bambara groundnut spaced at 20 cm \xD7 45 cm per plant grown on plots fertilized\
    \ with 75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;single super phosphate fertilizer (SSP)\
    \ had significantly (&lt;em&gt;P = .05&lt;/em&gt;) the tallest plants [24.53 cm\
    \ at 4 weeks after planting (WAP), 35.23 cm at 8WAP in 2015 and 25.00 cm at 4WAP\
    \ and 36.00 cm at 8WAP in 2016 respectively] compared with the other treatments.\
    \ The effects of single super phosphate fertilizer treatment on leaf area index\
    \ (6.04 in 2015 at 4WAP,\_ 45.86 in 2015 at 8WAP, 6.31 at\_ 4WAP in 2016 and 46.51\
    \ at\_ 8WAP in 2016) were significant (&lt;em&gt;P = .05&lt;/em&gt;) at the highest\
    \ at application rate of 75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of SSP. Plots which\
    \ had the lowest population density (111,111 plants hectare&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ and received the highest rate of\_ SSP (75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)\
    \ gave significantly (&lt;em&gt;P = .05&lt;/em&gt;)\_ the highest number of fresh\
    \ pods per plant at harvest (17.67 in 2015 and 19.00 in 2016) and weight of fresh\
    \ pods per plant (248.03 g plant&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2015 and 290.76g\
    \ plant&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2016 respectively) than the other treatments.\
    \ Total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentration 7 of soil were significantly\
    \ (&lt;em&gt;P = .05)&lt;/em&gt; higher in plots which received 75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ SSP than the other treatments. Plant population density of 111,111 plants hectare&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;\
    \ and SSP rate of 75 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is recommended for optimum\
    \ agronomic performance of Bambara groundnut in a degraded tropical ultisol.&lt;/p&gt;"
