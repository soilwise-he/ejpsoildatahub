  title: Bearing Capacity of Sulphuric Acid Content Soil
  abstract: Tests were conducted to determine the property of soil with variation
    of H2SO4 content for soils under different stage. The soils had varying amounts
    of plasticity's ranging from low to high plasticity. The unsaturated soil behavior
    was investigated for different conditions, covering a range of compactive efforts
    and water contents. The soil characteristic curves were more sensitive to changes
    in compaction effort than changes in compaction water content. In this research
    paper two types of water (Ground water Ph =7.9, Turbidity= 13 ppm; Cl =2.1mg/l
    and surface water Ph =8.65; Turbidity=18.5; Cl=1mg/l) were selected of Bhilai
    Nagar, State-Chhattisgarh, India which is mixed with a certain type of soil. Results
    shows that by the presence of ground water day by day the particles are becoming
    coarser in 7 days thereafter its size reduces; on the other hand by the presence
    of surface water the courser particles are disintegrating, finer particles are
    accumulating and also the dry density is reduces. Plasticity soils retained the
    smallest water content and the highest plasticity soils retained the highest water
    content at a specified suction. In addition, soil characteristic for soils to
    be compacted in the laboratory and in the field are still under process for analyzing
    the bearing capacity. The bearing capacity was reduced 2 to 3 times in the presence
    of H2SO4.
