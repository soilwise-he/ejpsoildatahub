  title: "Estimation of efficacy of use of new crops for stabilization of soil\u2013\
    plant system under allelopathic post-action conditions"
  abstract: "Effect of organic matter of new crops as green-manure on physiological\
    \ and biochemical properties of soil-plant system under lilac (<em>Syringa vulgaris</em>\
    \ L.) allelopathic post-action was studied. Lilac seedlings were grown for 17\
    \ months under greenhouse conditions in pots with grey forest soil collected after\
    \ long-term lilac cultivation. Green-manure as biomass of <em>Raphanus sativus\
    \ </em>var. <em>oliefera </em>L., <em>Sinapis alba</em> L., <em>Sida hermaphrodita\
    \ </em>Rusby.,<em> Rumex patientia</em> L. \xD7 <em>R. tianschanicus</em> A. Los.\
    \ was applied at 5 % to soil weight. The soil without green-manure was used as\
    \ control. Decrease in free phenolic substances concentration and simultaneous\
    \ increase in oxidation-reduction potential, humus and free amino acids contents\
    \ in soil during decay of the new crops biomass were observed. Application of\
    \ the green-manure reduced soil phytotoxicity, which led to increase in the lilac\
    \ seedlings growth. Decay products of organic residues of the new crops promoted\
    \ accumulation of photosynthetic pigments \u2013 chlorophylls (chlorophyll <em>b</em>\
    \ mainly) and carotenoids in leaves, which raised adaptability of the seedlings\
    \ to lilac allelopathic post-action. Efficacy of use as the greenmanure of <em>Raphanus\
    \ sativus</em> var. <em>oliefera </em>and <em>Sinapis alba</em> was higher as\
    \ compared with <em>Rumex patientia \xD7 R. tianschanicus </em>and, especially,\
    \ <em>Sida hermaphrodita</em>."
