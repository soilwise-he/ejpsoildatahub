  title: IOT a Dynamic Approach for Smart System Monitoring on Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The cultivation in our nation is much reduced due to lack of
    interest, scarcity of agriculture land and water and some farmers with their own
    interest they have been doing the cultivation at the present. But that also yields
    to very less production due to lack of awareness about the land dryness, no timely
    pesticide usage and suitable crops for the land. Hence the smart agriculture plays
    a vital role in promoting cultivation. It gives the solution by means of placing
    the sensor in the cultivation land to measure the soil efficiency. The paper describes
    how the sensed data will be processed and stored in cloud and from cloud the data
    will be relayed to the registered farm owners through their device in user understandable
    form. Abid Fareed | Abita Devi &quot;IOT a Dynamic Approach for Smart System Monitoring
