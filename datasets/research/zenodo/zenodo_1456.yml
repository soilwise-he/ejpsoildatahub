  title: Mechanical Characteristic Of Ferro Laterite Soil With Cement  Stabilization
    As A Subgrade Material
  abstract: 'This study aimed to determine and evaluated the mechanical characteristic
    of the<br>

    potential ferro laterite soil with cement stabilization to be used as base material.<br>

    Ferro laterite soil obtained from three different sampling sites at the East Halmahera<br>

    Regency. The sampling process of conventional excavation on the surface, soil
    sample<br>

    is inserted into the sample bag and labeling as LH1 for first location, LH2 for
    the<br>

    second location, and LH3 for a third location. Furthermore, soil prepared for
    testing<br>

    the physical properties. The sampling results were tested for physical properties
    of the<br>

    soil according to ASTM and SNI standardization, involved testing; moisture content,<br>

    particle size distribution, specific gravity, and the limits of Atterberg, as
    well as<br>

    compaction test. Making of the soil test specimen is done by mixing the ferro
    laterite<br>

    soil with the addition of cement in a composition of 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% on the<br>

    initial condition of maximum density and optimum moisture content standard Proctor<br>

    test results. Cylindrical test specimen with dimensions H = 2D, then cured for
    3, 7,<br>

    14, and 28 days before being tested for soil compressive strength with UCS testing.<br>

    The test results showed that the ferro laterite soil stabilization with cement
    increases<br>

    the compressive strength for the three types of ferro laterite soil that is significantly<br>

    until the curing time of 28 days (73-357 kPa, 79-588 kPa, 62-450 kPa, respectively<br>

    for LH1, LH2 and LH3), resulting with an increase in the percentage of cement<br>

    addition. Based on these test results, the ferro laterite soil has the potential
    to be used<br>

    as road base material and construction material, but it is necessary to test in
    detail<br>

    the physical model (prototype) prior to implementation in the field'
