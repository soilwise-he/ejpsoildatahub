  title: The Effect of Cover Crops on Soil Water Balance in Rain-Fed Conditions
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Soil and water conservation benefits of cover crops have been\
    \ hypothesized as a way to mitigate and adapt to changing climatic conditions,\
    \ but they can also have detrimental effects if rainfall is limited. Our objective\
    \ was to quantify effects of winter cover crops&nbsp;on soil water storage and\
    \ yield of silage maize under the agro-ecological conditions within Vojvodina\
    \ Province in Serbia. The experiment was conducted under rain-fed conditions at\
    \ three locations and included a control (bare fallow) plus three cover crop and\
    \ two N rate treatments. The cover crop treatments were common vetch (Vicia sativa\
    \ L.), triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus) and a mixture of the two\
    \ species. All were managed as green manure and subsequently fertilized with either\
    \ 120 or 160 kg N ha\U001000001 before planting silage maize (Zea mays L.). Cover\
    \ crop effects on soil water storage were calculated for two periods, March&ndash;May\
    \ and May&ndash;September/October. A Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) used\
    \ to characterize drought severity for 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, showed values\
    \ of 3 and 9, respectively, for the two periods. Soil water storage was reduced\
    \ by all cover crop treatments,&lt;br&gt;\nwith the greatest deficiency occurring\
    \ during the extremely dry year of 2012. Previous studies have shown cover crop\
    \ growth reduced by soil water depletion during their growing season and negative\
    \ effects on early-season growth and development of subsequent cash crops such\
    \ as silage maize, but if rainfall is extremely low it can also reduce cash crop\
    \ yield. This detrimental effect of cover crops on soil water balance was confirmed\
    \ by correlations between soil water storage and maize silage yield.&lt;/p&gt;"
