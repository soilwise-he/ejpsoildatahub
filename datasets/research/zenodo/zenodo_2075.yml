  title: Comparative Analysis of Some Digestion Methods Used in the Determination
    of Metals in Soil and Sediments
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Analytical study was carried in order to compare the accuracy
    of three (3) frequently used digestion methods, in the determination of metals
    in soil and sediments. Samples of soil and sediments were taken from three different
    locations namely; Bakalchi, Batare, and Anguwan Honna in Girei Local Government
    Area in Adamawa State Nigeria. Sample matrix was formed from the three samples
    and the three digestion methods was carried out on each of the sample matrix formed,
    the methods are, Method I: Roast before digestion using aqua regia as used by
    Ehi-Eromosele and coworkers [1], Method II: Air dried and digest using Aqua-regia
    similar to the work of Saxena [2], and Method III; Roast using ammonium chloride
    before digestion with aqua regia similar to the work of Voica et al [3]. The metal
    elements Calcium and Iron were chosen because of their relative abundance in natural
    soil and sediments. Results obtained shows that the soil and sediment samples
    contain the metal element calcium and Iron which were used to examine the frequently
    used digestion methods. Based on the result obtained from the analysis, method
    III (Roast with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and digest with aqua regia) appears
    to be the most promising, given the higher concentration of the elements in all
    the matrix samples examined.&lt;/p&gt;'
