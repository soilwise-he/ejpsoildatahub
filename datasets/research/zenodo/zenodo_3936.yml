  title: SOIL TEST CROP RESPONSE CONCENTRATES ON COWPEA (VIGNA UNGUICULATA (L). WALP.)
    IN MOLLISOL OF UTTARAKHAND, INDIA
  abstract: A field dissect was coordinated during spring 2009-2010 of each an Aquic
    hapludoll at the Norman E. Borlaug Crop Research Center of the G.B. Pant University
    of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar (290 N scope and 79 0 29' E longitude),
    as indicated by particular program of All India Coordinated Research Project on
    the earth test crop response relationship. The preliminary was coordinated in
    "two-phases". In the primary stage soil productivity tendency was made by detaching
    the test field into "three strips" and applying assessed doses of excrements in
    them (Strip I no fertilizer), Strip II (100, 100 and 100 kg/ha N, P2O5 and K2O/ha)
    independently, and strip III (200, 200 and 200 kg N, P2O5 and K2O) exclusively
    and creating of vapor crop Oat (Var. Kent). In the ensuing stage, for instance
    next season test crop Cowpea (var. Pant lobia-1) was created by secluding each
    strip into twenty-four plots having twenty-three fertilizer meds and one control
    plot. Response to "select" mixes of "three-levels" of FYM (0, 5 and 10 t/ha),
    "four-levels" of nitrogen (0, 15, 30 and 45 kg/ha), four degrees of phosphorus
    (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg/ha) and four degrees of potassium (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg/ha)
    at different readiness levels of cowpea was thought of. The estimations of the
    common carbon, Alkaline KMnO4 extractable N, Olsen's P and unprejudiced standard
    Ammonium Acetate extractable K in the test field went between 0.72-1.16 percent,
    112.30-200.60 kg/ha, 13.00-24.24 kg/ha and 101.90-245.30 kg/ha, exclusively. In
    the current assessment indisputably, the straw yield ran from 13.07-24.94 q/ha
    and full-scale grain yield went from 9.00-18.20 q/ha. The enhancement needs for
    making of one quintal of cowpea grain was 5.71 kg of nitrogen, 0.90 kg of phosphorus
    and 3.72 kg of potassium. Percent duty of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was
    62.00, 59.00 and 32.00 from soil, however from various sources as FYM was 7.00,
    29.00, 10.00; engineered fertilizer 30.00, 14.00 and 30.00 and conjoint usage
    of substance excrement with FYM 30.00, 17.00 and 27.00 to the extent NPK exclusively.
    With the help of these data excrement proposition at different yield targets and
    soil test worth can be resolved. Coefficient of quadratic different backslide
    (R2) was found incredibly basic (0.898**) between grain yield, soil test regards,
    included fertilizers and FYM. Normal carbon, solvent KMnO4-N, Olsen's-P and AB
    DTPA and Ammonium acidic corrosive deduction K and AB DTPA K methods for available
    N, P and K separately were at standard for the cowpea created in Mollisol of Uttarakhand
