  title: STUDY OF PHYSICO -CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL IN SELECTED URBAN WASTE STORAGE
    SITES OF KERALA
  abstract: Soil pollution is the contamination of soil by human and natural activities
    which may cause harmful effects on living organisms. Soil pollution mainly occurs
    due to industrial wastes, urban wastes, agricultural practices, radioactive pollutants
    etc. In the present study, the soil samples from three urban waste storage sites
    of Kerala- Vilappilsala, Brahmapuram and Njeliyanparambu were analyzed for physico-chemical
    properties (bulk density, texture, PH, electrical conductivity, available N, available
    P, available Ca and available Mg) and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Cr and Pb).
    The soil bulk density was highest in site 3 and 4 (1.10g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and lowest
    was in site 2 (1.08g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Texture of the soil is clayey soil in site
    3 and sandy clay loam in site 2 and site 4. pH range was high in site 4 (7.1)
    and lowest in site 3(4.3). Electrical conductivity was higher in site 4 (2.25
    dsm-1) and lower was in site 3 (0.15 dsm-1). Results obtained showed that soils
    of the various locations are significantly different from one another in terms
    of physical and chemical properties. Zn was found to be higher than all the other
    elements. The concentration of the metal was higher than the control site as a
    result of anthropogenic activities.
