  title: Effect of Some Tree Species in Nutrient Enrichment of Semi Arid Soil and
    Their Influence on Growth and Yield of Potted Maize in Borno State, Nigeria
  abstract: 'The effect of Balanites aegyptiaca, Faidherbia albida, and Tamarindus
    indica in nutrient enrichment of semi arid soil and their influence on growth
    and yield of potted maize was investigated in university of Maiduguri campus with
    the objectives of evaluating the impact of the tree species on soil fertility
    and the distance at which the trees could supply nutrients to the soil. An experiment
    was conducted to test the influence of the trees on potted maize growth and yield.
    A total of 63 soil samples were collected before and after rainy season at varying
    distances of 30 cm, 60 cm, and 90 cm and at a depth of 15 cm. The first set of
    twenty seven samples were collected in May 2014 before rainy season and were compared
    with soil after rainy season. The second set of 36 samples were collected under
    and outside tree canopies in October 2014 after rainy season. The collected samples
    were analysed for pH, N, EC, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, and CEC following standard laboratory
    techniques. Potted maize experiment was conducted in completely randomized block
    design for eighteen weeks. The result showed that organic matter, nitrogen, potassium,
    phosphorus, calcium, sodium was significant at p 0.05 at all distances before
    and after rainy season. Soil pH were found to be significant across the distance
    and are mainly neutral both before and after rainy season. The soil textural class
    were also significant at p 0.01 between species and across the distances. Soil
    under and outside canopy showed that F.albida had the highest value of nitrogen
    0.31g kg and lower value of 0.15g kg with control treatment at distance of 30
    cm. At distance 0f 60 cm F.albida had the higher value of N 0.32g kg and lower
    value 0.16g kg with control treatment. Phosphorus was significantly higher under
    B.aegyptiaca 14.5g kg at distance of 30cm, lower value of 3.73g kg under T.indica.
    At distance of 60 cm T. Indica had the higher value of P 6.30g kg, lower value
    4.39g kg with control treatment. F.albida had the higher value of potassium 5.09cmol
    kg, lower value 0.68cmol kg with control treatment at distance of 30 cm.T.indica
    had higher value of 2.34cmol kg, lower value 0.60cmol kg under control treatment
    at distance of 60 cm and B.aegyptiaca had 0.52cmol kg, lower under T.indica 0.38cmol
    kg at 90 cm distance. Calcium were significant at p 0.01 across the distances
    and between species. Maize crop grown in soil under F.albida had higher grain
    yield of 161.2g and control treatment had lower value of 19.97g. Maize crop grown
    in soil under F. albida and T.indica had better growth and yield. The result suggest
    that F.albida and T.indica are important agroforestry resource to sustain soil
    fertility and subsequently crop yield. F.lbida and T. indica could be the best
    choice to integrate into farming system in semi arid zone. Hajara Ibrahim Mustapha
