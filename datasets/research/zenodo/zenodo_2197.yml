  title: Assessment of Heavy Metal Enrichment and Level of Contamination of Floodplains
    Soil in Ondo State, Nigeria
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Flooding is one significant process that contributes to the\
    \ movement of sediment and metals. With higher velocities of water, flooding can\
    \ take contamination downstream. The soil samples were collected from three floodplains\
    \ of Owena river, Ogbese river and Ala river in Ondo State were analyzed for their\
    \ physico-chemical characteristics. The study also investigated the chemical speciation\
    \ of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn and total concentration in the soil samples. The concentration\
    \ of the heavy metals in the selected floodplains were orderly as Zn &gt; Cu &gt;\
    \ Ni &gt; Cd. Investigating the speciation showed that contribution to the total\
    \ metal content of the alluvial soil was from both geogenic and anthropogenic\
    \ sources. Pollution/Contamination index evaluation showed that the alluvial soils\
    \ had very slight metal contamination for all the metals except for Cd being found\
    \ in the range of very severe contamination to slight contamination in Owena and\
    \ Ala floodplains. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_The enrichment factor of\
    \ the heavy metals had a general trend of Ni = Cu &lt; Zn &lt; Cd. The \_\_\_\_\
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_geo-accumulation index also had a general\
    \ trend of Ni &lt; Cu &lt; Zn &lt; Cd. The pollution index \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_had highest value in Ala.&lt;/p&gt;"
