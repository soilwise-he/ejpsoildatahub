  title: Varieties and Soil Amendments (Poultry Manure) effect on growth and yield
    of Bambara Groundnut in Owerri, Southeastern Nigeria
  abstract: "Abstract\u2014 Bambara groundnut is an underutilize legume with poor\
    \ yield because of inadequate knowledge about high yielding varieties and soil\
    \ amendment rates. This experiment was carried out at the Teaching and Research\
    \ Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Imo State University,\
    \ Owerri, to determine the growth and yield potentials of five varieties and different\
    \ poultry manure rates of Bambara groundnut. The five varieties used were TVSU\
    \ 1482, TVSU 688, TVSU 921, Black local and White local, while the soil amendment\
    \ rates were 0kg/ha, 4000kg/ha, 6000kg/ha, and 8000kg/ha of poultry manure. The\
    \ experiment was set up in a split block using a randomized complete block design\
    \ (RCBD). Data collected include plant height, 50% flowering, days to 50 % maturity,\
    \ pod per ha and Seed yield per hectare. The data collected were analyzed using\
    \ the GLM SAS software while the means were separated using the Duncan\u2019s\
    \ multiple range test as described. Result showed that variety TVSU 688 had higher\
    \ performance than other varieties but not significantly better (P<0.05). The\
    \ manure rates were also significantly better than control (0kg/ha) in growth\
    \ and yield parameters. The experiment revealed that TVSU 688 has the highest\
    \ growth and yield traits in Owerri, while poultry manure applied at 4000 kg/ha\
    \ is also the most effective poultry manure rate to be considered in Bambara groundnut\
    \ cultivation."
