  title: A Review - Cowpathy and Vedic Krishi to improve Soil Health
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> The goal of this study\
    \ is to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of some cowpathy and vedic krishi\
    \ input. Organic farming uses the following systems to safe guard soil health\
    \ and enhance the biological performance of crop plants. These systems are Vrkshayurveda,\
    \ Panchagavya, Kunapajala, Beejamrit, Jeevamirit, Compost tea, Matka khad, Vermiwash\
    \ and Amrutpani. In vedic krishi and cowpathy, low input costs are complemented\
    \ by ecological and socioeconomic conditions that suit the needs of vast segments\
    \ of farming communities composed of small and marginal farmers. All of the Cowpathy\
    \ and vedic krishi inputs have been shown to significantly boost the productivity\
    \ of many crops and suppress a wide variety of plant pathogens. Plants that are\
    \ grown with Panchagavya and the beneficial microorganisms it contains are better\
    \ able to fight off pathogens and provide nutrients without chemical fertilizers\
    \ / pesticides. Vermiwash, Beejamrit and Jeevamirit all proved effective as foliar\
    \ treatments in enhancing the productivity and preventing the spread of disease."
