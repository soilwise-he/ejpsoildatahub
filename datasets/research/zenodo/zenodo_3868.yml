  title: IMPACT OF USED MOTOR OIL ON THE SOIL QUALITIES OF ORJI MECHANIC VILLAGE OWERRI,
    NIGERIA
  abstract: The study investigated the effects of used motor oil on soil physical
    and chemical variables and their particle size distribution. Two (2) replicate
    soil samples were collected from three radial coordinates 50 31.114N 70 02.703E,
    50 31.165 N 70 2.670E and 5023.35N 6059.176E respectively from the auto-mechanic
    village and agricultural land which serves as control; at depths of 0-15cm and
    15-30cm. Standard methods were adopted both for field and laboratory analysis,
    utilizing such instruments as Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (model FS 240 Varian),
    Jewniary, digital pH meter, Refractometer (model E- Line R.ATC- ), lovibond instrument
    model Cm-21 and mercury-in-built thermometer. Twenty three (23) different soils
    parameters were analyzed comprising total organic carbon, heavy metals, soil texture
    and particle size (clay, sand and silt) organic carbon, exchangeable cations (Na,
    Ca and Mg), conductivity, salinity, nutrients (N, P, K), bulk density and organic
    matter. The result indicated a variation at the mechanic site and control point.
    The pH of the auto-mechanic soils were acidic with the range of 4.3- 5.0 in comparison
    with the control point which had a mean value of 5.6. Heavy metals had higher
    values in auto mechanic soils than in the control and their concentration decreased
    in this trend, Cu 0.940&gt; Hg 0.211&gt; Ni 0.093&gt; Zn 0.051&gt; Pb 0.021&gt;
    Cd 0.015 &gt; Ar 0.003; Hg 1.385&gt; Cu 0.853&gt; Ni 0.079&gt; Zn 0.041&gt; Cd
    0.04&gt; Pb 0.034&gt; Ar 0.004. This showed that disposal of used motor oil on
    the soil affected the soil quality negatively. It is therefore; recommended that
    there should be a legislation to stop the indiscriminate dumping of spent oil
    and lubricants on the surface of the soil at Orji Mechanic village without treatment
    prior to disposal.
