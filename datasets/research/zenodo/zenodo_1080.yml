  title: "\uFEFFDefining the biosecurity risk posed by soil found on sea freight"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil associated with sea freight (shipping containers, flat
    racks and used machinery) arriving at New Zealand seaports was sampled for bacteria,
    fungi, nematodes, macro-invertebrates and plant seeds. Pseudomonads were selectively
    isolated, as several significant plant pathogens fall within this bacterial group.
    The mean and median sample weight collected from sea freight was found to be 417.3
    and 152.7 g, respectively, with most recovered soil (73%) collected from the underside
    of shipping containers and flat rack containers. Likewise, for used machinery,
    most recovered soil (75%) was found under the machinery. Flat rack containers
    had significantly higher soil contamination compared to shipping containers and
    used machinery, but generally the counts and incidence of taxa were significantly
    lower compared to these other freight types. Viable bacteria, fungi, nematodes,
    seeds and arthropods were associated with the soil, with both counts g-1 and prevalence
    in samples varying with taxa, freight type, and location on the freight. Various
    regulated biosecurity organisms were recovered from the samples, including &lt;i&gt;Aphelenchoides
    besseyi&lt;/i&gt; (rice white tip nematode), and seeds from genera such as &lt;i&gt;Brachiaria&lt;/i&gt;,
    &lt;i&gt;Cortaderia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Digitaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eragrostis&lt;/i&gt;
    and &lt;i&gt;Sonchus&lt;/i&gt;. There were also live arthropod taxa that were
    not recorded as being present in New Zealand. No known plant pathogenic pseudomonads
    were identified through sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Shipping containers
    were found to be an important introduction pathway for exotic species, and therefore
    require careful monitoring and management. Comparisons of the incidence and mean
    number of organisms associated with soil on sea freight compared to a previous
    study with soil on footwear, generally showed that incidence and counts of many
    taxa were lower on sea freight, indicating that biosecurity risk can vary with
    pathway. However, prioritising one soil pathway over another according to the
    risks they present, and differentially allocating resources is problematic because
    the relative risk is dynamic, dictated by factors such as new pests or diseases
    entering the respective pathways.&lt;/p&gt;'
