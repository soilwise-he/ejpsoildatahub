  title: Review Paper on Study on Properties of Black Cotton Soil using Stone Dust
    and Sisal Fiber
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is basic and important element in Civil Engineering field.
    Stability of every structure depends on the type and characteristics of foundation
    which in turn depends on the type of soil. Many problems irrupt if expansive soil,
    Natural soil is to be used in foundation, because of its shrinkage and swelling
    properties. There are many methods to make natural soil stable for various constructions.
    Natural soil is comfortable for road work, compared to other types of soil. There
    are two ways to enhance the quality of sub grade soil &quot;Replacement of soil&quot;
    or &quot;Soil stabilization&quot;. Soil stabilization can be done chemically or
    mechanically. Chemical stabilization is carried out by adding different chemicals
    in suitable proportion, while Mechanical stabilization is achieved by addition
    of admixtures which helps to improve the properties of soil. Wankhade Ashutosh
