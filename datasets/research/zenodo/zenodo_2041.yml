  title: Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
    (Pahs) Degrading Bacteria from Petrochemical Contaminated Soil
  abstract: <strong>Background and aims</strong>. Because of their ubiquitous nature,
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely dispersed in the environment
    as a result of both natural and human processes. One of the ways to deal with
    the harmful effects of these chemicals is through the use of microorganisms capable
    of degrading the pollutants. A petrochemical contaminated site was searched for
    these microbes. This study was conducted to isolate, characterize, and identify
    PAH-degrading bacteria from petrochemical polluted soil in Kano state, Nigeria
    <strong>Methods</strong>. Eleven bacterial strains were obtained in this work
    using the culture enrichment technique on Bushnell Hass medium supplemented with
    (naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene) as the only source of energy. Enumeration
    utilizing the spread-plate technique and liquid media were used to examine the
    PAH breakdown capacities of bacterial strains. The isolates were identified using
    standard methods of morphological and biochemical identifications. Furthermore,
    16sRNA was utilized in order to classify the isolates at molecular level. The
    presence of PAHs degrading genes was also analyzed in the isolates. <strong>Results</strong>.
    Four isolates (G1, G2, G5, and G6) out of a total of eleven were able to tolerate
    and degrade the test PAH's up to 600 mg/l in liquid media. Isolate G1 showed the
    highest growth during screening followed by G6 while there were no differences
    between the other two isolates as demonstrated by an increase in their optical
    densities after 120 hours of incubation. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and
    molecular phylogenetic analysis, the isolates were identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri,
    Stenetrophomonas sp, Pseudomonas lactis, and Achromobacterxylosoxidans with the
    accession numbers OM039162, OM52851, OM52852, and OM52853 respectively. Fragments
    of 350 bp, 350 bp, and 867 bp for ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (RHD), hydratase-aldolase,
    and catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase were obtained from partial PCR amplification of
    catabolic genes, demonstrating the presence of a PAH degradation pathway in the
    organisms. <strong>Conclusion</strong>. These isolates have great potential for
    application in the bioremediation of PAHs-contaminated sites.
