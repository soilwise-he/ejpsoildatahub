  title: Political Economy Of Integrated Soil Fertility Management In The Okavango
    Delta, Botswana
  abstract: "Although many factors play a significant role in agricultural production\
    \ and productivity, the importance of soil fertility cannot be underestimated.\
    \ The extent to which small farmers are able to manage the fertility of their\
    \ farmlands is crucial in agricultural development particularly in sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa (SSA).  This paper assesses the nutrient status of selected farmers\u2019\
    \ fields in relation to how government policy addresses the allocation of and\
    \ access to agricultural inputs (e.g. chemical fertilizers) in a unique social-ecological\
    \ environment of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. It also analyses small\
    \ farmers and soil scientists\u2019 perceptions about the political economy of\
    \ integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in the area. A multi-stage sampling\
    \ procedure was used to elicit quantitative and qualitative information from 228\
    \ farmers and 9 soil researchers through the use of interview schedules and questionnaires,\
    \ respectively. Knowledge validation workshops and focus group discussions (FGDs)\
    \ were also used to collect qualitative data from farmers. Thirty-three composite\
    \ soil samples were collected from 30 farmers\u2019 plots in three farming communities\
    \ of Makalamabedi, Nokaneng and Mohembo for laboratory analysis. While meeting\
    \ points exist, farmers and scientists have divergent perspectives on soil fertility\
    \ management. Laboratory analysis carried out shows that most soils in the wetland\
    \ and the adjoining dry-land/upland surroundings are low in essential nutrients\
    \ as well as in <em>cation </em>exchange capacity (CEC). Although results suggest\
    \ the identification and use of appropriate inorganic fertilizers, the low CEC\
    \ is an indication that holistic cultural practices, which are beyond mere chemical\
    \ fertilizations, are critical and more desirable for improved soil health and\
    \ sustainable livelihoods in the area. Farmers\u2019 age (t= -0.728;<em> p\u2264\
    0.10</em>); their perceptions about the political economy (t = -0.485; <em>p\u2264\
    0.01</em>) of ISFM; and their preference for the use of local knowledge in soil\
    \ fertility management (t = -10.254; <em>p\u22640.01</em>) had a significant relationship\
    \ with how they perceived their involvement in the implementation of ISFM."
