  title: A low cost spectroscopy with Raspberry Pi for soil macronutrient monitoring
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil spectroscopy measurement is widely used to determine the
    macronutrients content in the soil. Spectrometer is costly equipment and commonly
    used to determine the transmittance, absorbance or reflectance level of various
    liquids and opaque solids by measuring the intensity of light as a light source
    passes through a sample chemical substance. This paper is reported on a low cost
    experimental assessment of soil macronutrient for soil spectroscopy utilizing
    Raspberry Pi (RPI) module in visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength. The sensitivity
    measurements are mainly due to the concentration level and the intensity of light
    emitting diode (LED) light source. The work is focusing on the absorbance spectroscopy
    particularly on linear relationship to determine the Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus
    (P) and Potassium (K) content level in soil using colour-developing reagent. The
    development of low cost and portable RPI based spectrophotometer has created new
    possibilities to measure the concentration level of the existed soil macronutrient
    within visible and infrared light wavelength of light sources. The absorbance
    of light was computed based on Beer-Lambert Law. The low cost RPI based spectrometer
    costs 80% less than the spectrometer available in the market and is capable of
    recording the absorbance measurements up to 5 samples. The performance of this
    prototype shows that it is possible to build the spectrometer using open-source
    software and hardware by considering the limiting factors such as light transfer
    to the sample, spectral filtering and the sensitivity due to the signal-to-noise
    ratio.&lt;/p&gt;'
