  title: "The heavy metal content of soil and shoots of Vaccinium myrtillus L. in\
    \ the S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park"
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The research was carried out in the S\u0142owi\u0144ski National\
    \ Park, in an area with 15 research stations in pine coniferous forests situated\
    \ at locations (1) inaccessible to tourists, (2) most frequently visited by tourists\
    \ as well as (3) in the vicinity of parking lots. The analysed samples comprised\
    \ surface generic levels (Ol, Ofh, A), aboveground material (shoots; leaves and\
    \ stems) and below-ground material (roots) of bilberry (&lt;em&gt;Vaccinium myrtillus&lt;/em&gt;).\
    \ The performed analyses showed statistically significant Spearman&rsquo;s correlation\
    \ coefficients for Zn content in the &lsquo;soil &ndash; stems:&rsquo; (r = -0.44,\
    \ p &lt; 0.05, n = 45) relationship and the &lsquo;soil &ndash; roots&rsquo; relationship\
    \ (r = -0.52, p &lt; 0.05, n = 45). Accordingly, there were significant statistical\
    \ differences (U Mann-Whitney test) in zinc content in the &lsquo;stems&lt;br\
    \ /&gt;\n&ndash; roots&rsquo; relationship and the &lsquo;leaves &ndash; roots&rsquo;\
    \ relationship. Furthermore, the obtained results reveal an excessive accumulation\
    \ of Mn in &lt;em&gt;V. myrtillus&lt;/em&gt;. The content of the investigated\
    \ heavy metals in &lt;em&gt;V. myrtillus&lt;/em&gt; shoots decreased in&lt;br\
    \ /&gt;\nthe following order: Mn &gt; Fe &gt; Zn &gt; Cu.&lt;/p&gt;"
