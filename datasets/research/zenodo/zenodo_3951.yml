  title: Cellolytic Activity of Bacteria of the Bacillus Genus Isolated from the Soil
    of Zailiskiy Alatau Slopes
  abstract: "This study was conducted for the investigation of \nnumber of cellulolytic\
    \ bacteria and their ability in decomposition. \nSeven samples surface soil were\
    \ collected on cellulose Zailiskii \nAlatau slopes. Cellulolitic activity of new\
    \ strains of Bacillus, isolated \nfrom soil is determined. Isolated cellulose\
    \ degrading bacteria were \nscreened for determination of the highest cellulose\
    \ activity by \nquantitative assay using Congo red, gravimetric assay and \ncolorimetric\
    \ DNS method trough of the determination of the \nparameters of sugar reduction.\
    \ Strains are assigned to: B.subtilis, \nB.licheniformis, B. cereus and, \u0412\
    . megaterium. Bacillus strains \nconsisting of several different types of cellulases\
    \ have broad substrate \nspecificity of cellulase complexes formed by them. Cellulolitic\
    \ \nbacteria were recorded to have highest cellulase activity and selected \n\
    for optimization of cellulase enzyme production."
