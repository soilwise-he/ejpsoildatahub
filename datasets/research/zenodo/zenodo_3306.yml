  title: Gypseous Soil Improvement Using Fuel Oil
  abstract: 'This research investigates the suitability of fuel oil in

    improving gypseous soil. A detailed laboratory tests were carried-out

    on two soils (soil I with 51.6% gypsum content, and soil II with

    26.55%), where the two soils were obtained from Al-Therthar site

    (Al-Anbar Province-Iraq).

    This study examines the improvement of soil properties using the

    gypsum material which is locally available with low cost to minimize

    the effect of moisture on these soils by using the fuel oil. This study

    was conducted on two models of the soil gypsum, from the Tharthar

    area. The first model was sandy soil with Gypsum content of (51.6%)

    and the second is clayey soil and the content of Gypsum is (26.55%).

    The program included tests measuring the permeability and

    compressibility of the soil and their collapse properties. The shear

    strength of the soil and the amounts of weight loss of fuel oil due to

    drying had been found. These tests have been conducted on the

    treated and untreated soils to observe the effect of soil treatment on

    the engineering properties when mixed with varying degrees of fuel

    oil with the equivalent of the water content.

    The results showed that fuel oil is a good material to modify the

    basic properties of the gypseous soil of collapsibility and

    permeability, which are the main problems of this soil and retained

    the soil by an appropriate amount of the cohesion suitable for

    carrying the loads from the structure.'
