  title: Isolation and characterization of phosphate solubilizing bacteria in saline
    soil from Costal Region of Odisha
  abstract: "The present study was conducted to isolate phosphate solubilizing bacteria\
    \ (PSB) from rhizospheric saline soils of coastal Odisha, India and evaluated\
    \ their phosphate solubilizing ability. Total four PSB were isolated based on\
    \ the halo zone formation (solubilizing index 2.63-3.14) on PVK agar medium and\
    \ were characterized based on biochemical and molecular characteristics as <em>Bacillus\
    \ subtilis</em> (B1), <em>B. megaterium</em> (B2), <em>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</em>\
    \ (P2) and <em>Kocuria kristinae</em> (P6). The inorganic phosphate released by\
    \ PSB ranged from 18.532 to 38.250\xB5g/ml with decreasing the pH PVK broth up\
    \ to 3.9. Acid phosphatase activity for PSB were recorded 84.237-98.658\xB5mol/min.\
    \ Glucose was found to be the best carbon source for <em>B. subtilis</em>, <em>Sphingomonas\
    \ paucimobilis</em> and <em>Kocuria kristinae</em> whereas mannitol for <em>B.\
    \ megaterium</em>. Optimum acid phosphatase activity was observed for all the\
    \ four PSB isolates in presence of ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source in PVK\
    \ broth at 30oC and pH 7.0."
