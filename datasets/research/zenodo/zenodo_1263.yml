  title: Influence of soil in oak root system on its response to bending
  abstract: Tree root system belongs to a key factor of the tree stability because
    it provides the anchorage point to the ground/soil, beside its physiological purpose.
    Therefore, to assess the tree stability with a certainty, it is needed to have
    information about tree root-plate, ie. to know roots health state, its geometrical
    distribution in a space with respect to a tree and surrounding objects, to know
    properties of the ground (soil) and to know material properties of roots. This
    work assessed 10 oak trees in terms of their reaction to bending induced by a
    standard pulling test accompanied with optical technique based on digital image
    correlation to obtain displacement at various locations of tree. Trees were tested
    in both intact state and with soil removed from the surface of the root plate.
    Results showed that performed soil removal did not have statistically significant
    effect on apparent tree stiffness. The same conclusions were found based on data
    provided by both inclinometers and digital camera.
