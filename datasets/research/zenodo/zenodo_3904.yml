  title: A Study On Biodegradation Of Coir Pith By Soil Fungi And Its Utilization
    In Plant Growth
  abstract: Coconut (cocus nucifera) plays a significant role in the agrarian economy
    of India. The husk of the coconut is a source of fibre, which supports a sizable
    coir industry. Coir pith is a lignocellulosic waste material obtained from coir
    processing factories which causes major disposal problem and thereby causes environmental
    hazard. Recent studies, prove coir pith waste as a source of agricultural manure.
    But, when coir pith is treated biologically using micro-organisms, studies reveal
    its significance as organic manure and shows good results in plant growth.In the
    present study, an attempt was made to biodegrade coir pith using suitable microbes,
    fungi, isolated from the municipal sewage .The isolated fungi, Aspergillus flavus  and  Aspergillus
    tubingensis, were identified and using coir pith,compost were prepared from both
    the fungi, Aspergillus flavus  and  Aspergillus tubingensis .The composts  prepared
    was used for plant growth (Fenugreek-  Trigonella Foenum Graecum). Compost of
    various mixtures and various compositions were used as growing media and the efficiency
    of compost was judged.The efficiency of both the compost individually and in combination
    were identified at various intervals of plant growth and at various ratios of
    culture. Aspergillus tubingensis was identified to be more efficient in all growth
    media and in all the study .Analysis of the plant and various growth media were
    analyzed for proving the efficiency of plant growth.Compost with Aspergillus tubingensis  shows
    better results than compost with  Aspergillus flavus .Both the compost in combination  also
    proved good result in plant growth.
