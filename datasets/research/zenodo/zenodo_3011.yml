    induced phytoremediation of cadmium and lead contaminated alluvial soil by Chrysanthemum
    indicum L.

    \ <em>Manuscript received online 21 December 2014, revised 08 January 2015, accepted\
    \ 02 February 2015</em> The integrated potential of vermicompost, elemental sulphur\
    \ (S) and Glomus fasciculatum by growing <em>Chrysanthemum indicum</em> L. for\
    \ phytoremediation of cadmium and lead contaminated soils was investigated under\
    \ pot experiment. The integrated treatment T<sub>6</sub> (6 g kg<sup>\u20131</sup>\
    \ vermicompost, 0.8 g kg<sup>\u20131</sup> S and inoculation with <em>G. fasciculatum</em>)\
    \ promoted the dry biomass of the plant. The treatment was feasible for enhanced\
    \ cadmium accumulation up to 6.69 and 5.66 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> and lead accumulation\
    \ up to 16.70 and 13.74 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> in root and shoot, respectively,\
    \ which caused maximum remediation efficiency (0.55% and 0.18%) and bioaccumulation\
    \ factor (2.57 and 0.84) for Cd and Pb, respectively at the Naini contaminated\
    \ site (S<sub>2</sub> ). Thus, authors conclude to integrate vermicompost, elemental\
    \ sulphur and inoculation with <em>Glomus fasciculatum</em> for enhanced clean-up\
    \ of cadmium and lead-contaminated soils."
