  title: Impact of tobacco cultivation on soil and human health in the agricultural
    ecosystem at Tangail region of Bangladesh
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted to determine the impact of tobacco cultivation
    on soil and human health in the agricultural ecosystem at Bhuapur and Kalihati
    upazila of Tangail region from January to December 2019. Among them, 40 soil samples
    were collected, each 20 from Kalihati and Bhuapur Upazila. Among 20 samples, every
    10 samples were collected from tobacco and non-tobacco land at a depth of 0 to
    15 cm in Bhuapur, 0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm in Kalihati Upazila. The soil pH, organic
    matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), available sulfur (S),
    available zinc (Zn), exchangeable potassium (K), exchangeable magnesium (Mg) and
    exchangeable calcium (Ca) were analyzed in the laboratory of Soil Resource Development
    Institute (SRDI), Tangail. In Kalihati Upazila, tobacco land showed significantly
    higher content of OM, available N, available P, available Zn, exchangeable K and
    exchangeable Mg, whereas pH was low in non-tobacco land. Surface soil (0 to 15
    cm) and tobacco land showed significantly higher content of S than sub-surface
    (15 to 30 cm) soil and non-tobacco land. On the other hand, there was no significant
    variation between tobacco and non-tobacco land on soil properties in Bhuapur Upazila.
    In both Upazilas, all the nutrients except exchangeable Ca and Mg were lower than
    optimum in tobacco and non-tobacco land, which was unsuitable for crop cultivation.
    The cost of production was higher in tobacco land than in non-tobacco land in
    both Upazilas. About 36% of farmers informed that they were suffering from various
    diseases due to tobacco cultivation and curing. Tobacco cultivation in these areas
    degrades soil health and the agricultural ecosystem and releases nicotine into
    the environment, hampering food safety and human health. The study indicated that
    tobacco cultivation should be replaced by other crops to protect soil quality
    and human health.&lt;/p&gt;'
