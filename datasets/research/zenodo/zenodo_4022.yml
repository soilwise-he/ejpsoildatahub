  title: Drafting The Design And Development Of Micro- Controller Based Portable Soil
    Moisture Sensor For Advancement In Agro Engineering
  abstract: 'Moisture is an important consideration in many

    aspects ranging from irrigation, soil chemistry, golf course, corrosion

    and erosion, road conditions, weather predictions, livestock feed

    moisture levels, water seepage etc. Vegetation and crops always

    depend more on the moisture available at the root level than on

    precipitation occurrence. In this paper, design of an instrument is

    discussed which tells about the variation in the moisture contents of

    soil. This is done by measuring the amount of water content in soil by

    finding the variation in capacitance of soil with the help of a

    capacitive sensor. The greatest advantage of soil moisture sensor is

    reduced water consumption. The sensor is also be used to set lower

    and upper threshold to maintain optimum soil moisture saturation and

    minimize water wilting, contributes to deeper plant root growth

    ,reduced soil run off /leaching and less favorable condition for insects

    and fungal diseases. Capacitance method is preferred because, it

    provides absolute amount of water content and also measures water

    content at any depth.'
