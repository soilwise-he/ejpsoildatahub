  title: Investigation of Treacle's Effects for Cohesive Soil Stabilization
  abstract: 'Natural soils have flaws in terms of workability, so it''s critical to
    implement experimental techniques to increase soil workability and meet construction
    demands. Stabilization is essential for construction objectives such as enhancing
    the soil''s carrying capacity, overcoming swelling issues in expansive soil, and
    so on. In this paper, we look at how treacle can be used to strengthen cohesive
    soil. We evaluated the geotechnical parameters of stabilized and unsterilized
    soil to see if the stabilizer had an influence on cohesive soil. On both stabilized
    soil and native soil samples, the following tests were performed: Atterberg''s
    limit test, shrinkage test, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test, California
    Bearing Ration (CBR) test, and swelling test. Cohesive soil with treacle, whether
    or not it can be used as a stabilizing agent for coherent soil, has been experimentally
    examined for determining soil strength properties. Finally, the amount of treacle
    that is effective as a stabilizing agent, treacle quality measures, soil stabilizing
    lab trials, and other requirements for further positive progress on this idea
    for cohesive soil improvements are explored.'
