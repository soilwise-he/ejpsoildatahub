  title: Verification of Vehicular Emitted Aerosol Components in Soil Biochemical
    Characteristics in Owerri West Local Government Area, Imo State, Nigeria.
  abstract: "<em>The study was carried out in Avu Junction in Owerri West L.G.A. at\
    \ graded distant from the tarred road with an average vehicular flow between 10,000\
    \ to 12,000 per day. Soil samples were taken at the distant of 50m, 100m, 150m\
    \ and 200m respectively. And auger soil samples were taken at the depths of 0-30\
    \ cm and 30-45 cm accordingly. Soil factor, heavy metals and microbial populations\
    \ were investigated at graded distances. From the result of soil factors, pH values\
    \ indicated acidity with decreased distant from the tarred road ranging between\
    \ 4.52 \u2013 6.32, soil temperature on the topsoil was higher than subsoil ranging\
    \ between 19- 25 0C and 18 \u2013 22 0C and soil moisture increases with increased\
    \ distant from the tarred road ranging between 10.00 \u2013 13.3. Heavy metal\
    \ concentrations in the soil increased with decreased distant in the order of\
    \ Pb &lt; Zn &lt; Ni &lt; Cu &lt; Cd. Overall results revealed that Cd in the\
    \ soil constitutes the highest percentage of 91.7%, Ni 90.9%, Cu 90.1%, Pb. 84.7%\
    \ and Zn. 81.7%. Significantly, higher fungi and bacterial populations were recorded\
    \ at increased distant from the tarred road. This then called for proactive measures\
    \ to checkmate soil contamination due to pollutants from vehicular flows. </em>"
