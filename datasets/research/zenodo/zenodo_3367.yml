  title: 'Soil Compaction In Tropical Organic Farming Systems And Its Impact On Natural
    Soil-Borne Disease Suppression: Challenges For Management'
  abstract: Organic farming systems still depend on intensive, mechanical soil tillage.
    Frequent passes by machinery traffic cause substantial soil compaction that threatens
    soil health. Adopting practices as reduced tillage and organic matter retention
    on the soil surface are considered effective ways to control soil compaction.
    In tropical regions, however, the acceleration of soil organic matter decomposition
    and soil carbon turnover on the topsoil layer is influenced more rapidly by the
    oscillation process of drying and wetting. It is hypothesized therefore, that
    rapid reduction in soil organic matter hastens the potential for compaction to
    occur in organic farming systems. Compaction changes soil physical properties
    and as a consequence it has been implicated as a causal agent in the inhibition
    of natural disease suppression in soils. Here we describe relationships between
    soil management in organic vegetable systems, soil compaction, and declining soil
    capacity to suppress pathogenic microorganisms.
