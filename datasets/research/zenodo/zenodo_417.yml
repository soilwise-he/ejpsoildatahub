  title: 'Cement Stabilization for Improved Soil Performance: A Case Study of Ogume
    Clay Soil in the Niger-Delta Region, Nigeria'
  abstract: '<em>This research investigates the use of stabilized sub-bases in coastal
    road construction. Three sample categories were examined: untreated soil, soil
    stabilized with 5% cement, and soil stabilized with 8% cement. The study focuses
    on cement stabilization due to its suitability and availability. CBR (California
    Bearing Ratio) tests were conducted on the natural sub-grade material, revealing
    low CBR values that indicated insufficient strength to withstand traffic loads
    without deformation. However, the addition of varying percentages of cement as
    a stabilizer resulted in a significant strength increase. CBR values improved
    from 15% for natural soil to 27%, 33%, 50%, and 86% for cement percentages of
    5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, and 6.5% respectively. Sieve analysis showed reduced fines content
    in the stabilized materials compared to the non-stabilized ones. Compaction tests
    demonstrated increased Maximum Dry Density (MDD) and Optimum Moisture Content
    (OMC) for the stabilized materials. The liquid limit (LL) was zero, and the Plasticity
    Index (PI) indicated non-plastic behavior for all samples. The results highlight
    the positive impact of sand-cement stabilization on road construction materials
    in coastal areas, significantly improving their strength. The study emphasizes
    the importance of determining the appropriate stabilizer amount through laboratory
    testing and implementing robust construction techniques to ensure consistent strength
    in the road. CBR tests on the stabilized soil samples met the requirements for
    sub-base materials (CBR value of 30%) and base-course materials (CBR value of
    80%) with higher cement percentages. The minimum cement percentages to meet these
    CBR requirements were found to be 5.36% and 6.48% respectively</em>'
