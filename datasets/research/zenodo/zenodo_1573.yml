  title: Screening for antibacterial producing bacteria isolated from soil in Keffi,
    Nasarawa, State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Antibiotics are secondary metabolites that inhibit other competing cells\
    \ to give competitive advantage to the microorganisms that produce them. This\
    \ study is aimed at screening for antibacterial producing bacteria isolated from\
    \ soil in Keffi. Standard microbiological methods were used in isolation and screening\
    \ for antimicrobial of activity of crude extracts. Molecular identification of\
    \ bacteria isolated were carried out using 16srRNA method. The antibacterial activity\
    \ was carried out using agar well diffusion methods. The highest bacteria were\
    \ Isolated from maize rhizosphere (90.0%) and the least was from groundnut rhizosphere\
    \ (50.0%). Bacterial isolated and identified using 16srRNA were <em>Pseudomonas\
    \ fluorescens</em>, <em>Pseudomonas antarctica</em>, <em>Bacillus megaterium</em>\
    \ and <em>Acetobacter aceti</em>. The screening for antimicrobial producing bacteria\
    \ showed that bacterial with laboratory code Gn3 (<em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>)\
    \ showed activity against <em>E. coli </em>(8.57\xB11.01 mm), <em>S. typhi</em>\
    \ (5.10\xB10.11 mm) and <em>S. aureus </em>(6.12\xB10.32 mm). Ma1 had activity\
    \ against <em>E. coli </em>(8.57\xB11.01 mm), <em>S. typhi</em> (5.10\xB10.11\
    \ mm) and <em>S. aureus </em>(6.12\xB10.32 mm). Ma2 had activity against <em>E.\
    \ coli </em>(7.56\xB11.33 mm) and <em>S. typhi </em>(4.54\xB10.34 mm) and Rc2\
    \ had activity only against <em>S. aureus </em>(12.12\xB10.98 mm) The Antibacterial\
    \ activity of bacteria isolated and grown in complex medium with nitrogen source\
    \ revealed that <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> showed activity against the test\
    \ organism <em>E. coli</em> (14.03\xB11.06mm), <em>S. typhi</em> (9.11\xB11.11mm)\
    \ and <em>S. aureus </em>(5.12\xB11.02 mm). It was observed in this study that\
    \ bacterial isolated from soil in Keffi were able to produce substance that that\
    \ inhibit other bacterial."
