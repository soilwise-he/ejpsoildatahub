  title: Assessment of Soil Contamination on the Content of Macro and Microelements
    and the Quality of Grass Pea Seeds (Lathyrus sativus L.)
  abstract: 'Comparative research has been conducted to allow us to determine the
    content of macro and microelements in the vegetative and reproductive organs of
    grass pea and the quality of grass pea seeds, as well as to identify the possibility
    of grass pea growth on soils contaminated by heavy metals. The experiment was
    conducted on an agricultural field subjected to contamination from the Non-Ferrous-Metal
    Works (MFMW) near Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The experimental plots were situated at different
    distances of 0.5 km and 8 km, respectively, from the source of pollution. On reaching
    commercial ripeness the grass pea plants were gathered. The composition of the
    macro and microelements in plant materials (roots, stems, leaves, seeds), and
    the dry matter content, sugars, proteins, fats and ash contained in the grass
    pea seeds were determined. Translocation factors (TF) and bioaccumulation factor
    (BCF) were also determined. The quantitative measurements were carried out through
    inductively-coupled plasma (ICP). The grass pea plant can successfully be grown
    on soils contaminated by heavy metals. Soil pollution with heavy metals does not
    affect the quality of the grass pea seeds. The seeds of the grass pea contain
    significant amounts of nutrients (K, P, Cu, Fe Mn, Zn) and protein (23.18-29.54%).
    The distribution of heavy metals in the organs of the grass pea has a selective
    character, which reduces in the following order: leaves &gt; roots &gt; stems
    &gt; seeds. BCF and TF values were greater than one suggesting efficient accumulation
    in the above ground parts of grass pea plant. Grass pea is a plant that is tolerant
    to heavy metals and can be referred to the accumulator plants. The results provide
    valuable information about the chemical and nutritional composition of the seeds
    of the grass pea grown on contaminated soils in Bulgaria. The high content of
    macro and microelements and the low concentrations of toxic elements in the grass
    pea grown in contaminated soil make it possible to use the seeds of the grass
    pea as animal feed.'
