  title: Soil Surge Characteristics During Lightning Discharge
  abstract: "An electro-dynamic model of soil has been developed that takes into account\
    \ the frequency dependent and nonlinear soil parameters. Its primary aim is to\
    \ examine and validate different engineering return stroke models during discharge,\
    \ but it can successfully be used for examining and calculation of the grounding.\
    \ The model accounts for surge behaviour in soils with a wide range of conductivities.\
    \ The use of the new model for studies at high lightning currents reveals that\
    \ a great change in the grounding concept can be expected compared to what was\
    \ previously established in many studies. It is shown that the concept of soil\
    \ impedance is not applicable in cases of nonlinear resistance and capacitance\
    \ of the grounding. The same holds for the current reflection coefficient. The\
    \ new model can be applied when the wavelength of each component in the channel-base\
    \ current frequency spectrum is much greater than its skin depth in the soil.\
    \ For most soils the new model is applicable up to 10 MHz. It shows that the channel-base\
    \ current and the grounding characteristics are related and cannot be treated\
    \ independently. In other words, the current pulse in any particular return stroke,\
    \ even in the same flash, \u201Esees\u201C its own grounding impedance depending\
    \ on its frequency content and current magnitude."
