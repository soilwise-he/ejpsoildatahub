  title: Effect of rice straw ash on soil properties and yield of cucumber
  abstract: "Many farmers in Nigeria are paying close attention to using Rice Straw\
    \ Ash (RSA) as a soil fertility enhancement additive. The short and long-term\
    \ effects of applying this ash to the soil quality were not adequately investigated,\
    \ however. This research was conducted at the Departmental Farm of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Engineering, Bayero University, Kano to access the impact\
    \ of RSA on the soil\u2019s physiochemical properties and on cucumber yield. Twelve\
    \ (12) experimental plots were treated with different amounts of RSA (0 Kg, 1\
    \ Kg, 2 Kg and 3 Kg) to assess the intensity effect of the treatment on both soil\
    \ physiochemicals and crop yield. For each experimental plot, soil properties\
    \ (moisture content, porosity, bulk density, electrical conductivity, organic\
    \ matter, pH and sodium concentration, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium\
    \ and magnesium) were measured and analyzed before and after the experiment. The\
    \ results showed that the application of ash increased moisture content, bulk\
    \ density, porosity, electrical conductivity, organic matter and sodium concentration\
    \ while reducing the pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium\
    \ levels. The mean yield in 0 Kg RSA (21,84tons / ha) was found to be the highest.\
    \ There was a drop in the yield (13.08-14.14tons / ha) of crop in the plots treated\
    \ with RSA. The research concluded that continued use of RSA could lead to a reduction\
    \ in crop yield as the EC level was found to be rising. It is on this basis that\
    \ farmers are advised to avoid the use of RSA as an additive for soil fertility\
    \ enhancement and other means should therefore be used."
