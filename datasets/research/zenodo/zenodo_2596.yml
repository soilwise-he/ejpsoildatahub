  title: 'Toxic Air And Soil In Automobile Workshop Impact Negatively On The Health
    Status Of Automechanics: The Nigeria Environment'
  abstract: "Objective: Auto-mechanics are constantly in contact with both air and\
    \ soil harmful chemicals and toxic substances in their environment. A comparative\
    \ cross-sectional study of analysis of hazardous stationary emissions of air and\
    \ soil petroleum pollutants in automobile workshops has been analyzed. Furthermore,\
    \ the impact of prolonged or continual occupational and environmental exposure\
    \ on health of auto-mechanics from two distinct and contrasting automobile workshop\
    \ environments was studied.  Methods: Data were collected by a questionnaire interview\
    \ designed about occupational activities, lung functions and blood samples of\
    \ the subjects, soil samples and air qualities from automobile workshops and control\
    \ sites were collected for analysis. Samples were collected from June to September\
    \ 2016, during the rainy season.  Results: Auto-mechanics are at higher risk for\
    \ respiratory, hepatic, reproductive, haematological, immune, platelet and selenium\
    \ dysfunctions, as a result of direct exposure to both volatile organic compound\
    \ (0.212 ppm) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (62.370 mg/kg) toxicities, respectively.\
    \ There were substantial regional variations in the burden of the petroleum toxicant\
    \ estimates, with Ihiala bearing most of the burdens compared with Port Harcourt\
    \ and Obrikom. The present data revealed increase in concentration of some liver\
    \ enzymes, total bilirubin, total protein, mean platelet volume, but decrease\
    \ in selenium, red blood count, white cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, testosterone,\
    \ force expiratory volume in auto-mechanics in comparison with control (p \u2264\
    \ 0.05)."
