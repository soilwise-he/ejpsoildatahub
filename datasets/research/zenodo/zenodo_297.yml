  title: Soil Stabilization Study by using Steel Slag
  abstract: 'The growing needs for fully furnished highways in the developed countries
    has led engineers to search for the durable cost effective measure for roadway
    construction. The basic necessity for suitable base course for roads is an important
    aspect in construction. The paper aims at utilizing the common waste materials
    for the improvement of roads. One such material that was analyzed in the paper
    for the execution of road work is the steel slag which is furnished in tones in
    the steel factories across the country. The use of the material is found to have
    improved the sub grade properties of soil to a good extent. Nitesh | Sumesh Jain
