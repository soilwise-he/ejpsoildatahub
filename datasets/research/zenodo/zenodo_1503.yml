  title: Study on Imidacloprid Induced Intoxication and Its Biodegradation by Soil
    Isolate Bacillus weihenstephanensis
  abstract: '<strong>Aims: </strong>The study was conducted to investigate the effect
    of imidacloprid on biochemical parameters and soil isolate growth. The soil isolate
    was also studied for imidacloprid degradation. <strong>Study Design: </strong>The
    soil isolate was identified and used for toxicity testing. The isolate of <em>Bacillus
    weihenstephanensis</em> was further tested for its ability to degrade imidacloprid
    in minimal salt medium (MSM) and tryptic soya medium (TSB). The role of plasmid
    in imidacloprid degradation was established by curing experiments. <strong>Place
    and Duration of Study: </strong>Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology,
    Karnatak University, Dharwad, India between June 2011 and December 2012. <strong>Methodology:
    </strong>The soil isolate was identified by morphological, biochemical characters
    and 16s rDNA identification. Effect of imidacloprid on DNA, RNA, protein, glucose
    and growth in soil isolate was studied with 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup>
    molar imidacloprid for 96 h. Imidacloprid degradation was determined in MSM and
    TSB for 28 days with samples taken on 7, 14, 21 and 28<sup>th</sup> day. The insecticide
    concentration was tested by HPLC. Plasmid curing was performed. <strong>Results:
    </strong>The soil isolate was identified as <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis</em>.
    The study involving soil isolate <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis</em> with 10<sup>-3</sup>
    to 10<sup>-7</sup> molar imidacloprid showed significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease
    in content of DNA, RNA, protein, glucose and growth. <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis</em>
    in MSM and TSB showed 46 and 78% imidacloprid degradation in four weeks. The plasmid
    of <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis</em> was cured in fourth generation. 18.80%
    and 75% degradation observed in cured and non cure cells of <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis
    </em>in TSB. <strong>Conclusion: </strong>Study showed that imidacloprid affects
    the biochemical contents and intern growth of soil isolate <em>Bacillus weihenstephanensis</em>.
    Study also revealed that <em>Bacillus</em> <em>weihenstephanensis </em>was able
    to degrade imidacloprid in MSM and TSB. Further plasmid curing revealed that the
    genes for imidacloprid degradation are located both in plasmid and chromosome.
    The soil isolate was able to utilize imidacloprid as sole carbon and nitrogen
    source as indicated by its growth in MSM.'
