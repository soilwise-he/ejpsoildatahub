  title: Application Of Soil Quality Indexes For The Habitat Conditions Variability
    Assessment In The Forestry Rehabilitated Former Mining Spoil Banks
  abstract: "According to Polish law, all former mining areas, whether for coal or\
    \ other minerals should be rehabilitated. This paper analyses the possibility\
    \ of using of indexes of Soil Trophy (ITGL) and Site Soil (SIG) to describe variability\
    \ in the \u201CBe\u0142chat\xF3w\u201D Brown Coal Mine dumping grounds for mining\
    \ subsidence, which have been reclaimed for forestry. Research was conducted in\
    \ four substrate variants forming the soil bedrock being created of: nutrient-rich,\
    \ sandy clay Quaternary (NWL on the inside spoil bank) and clay silt (NZL on the\
    \ outside spoil bank), as well as poorer Quaternary sandy (NWG on the inside spoil\
    \ bank) and acidic Miocene sands after neutralisation by bog lime (NZG on the\
    \ outside spoil bank). Based on the values calculated for the tested indicators,\
    \ a site assessment was carried out according to the scale drawn up for \u201C\
    natural\u201D conditions. It was confirmed that concerning these two indicators\
    \ tested on the mine\u2019s spoil banks that the ITGL index reflected the soil\
    \ variability better because the partial indicators valuation was based on the\
    \ other soil properties and data transformation than the SIG. However, for a better\
    \ description of the habitats which are forming in these conditions, it would\
    \ be preferable to modify the partial indicators assessments described by these\
    \ indexes based on the variability of post-mining soil properties."
