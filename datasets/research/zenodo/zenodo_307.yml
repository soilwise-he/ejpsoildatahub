  title: SOIL IMPROVEMENT USING LIME AND POLYPROPYLENE FIBERS
  abstract: Soil modification is the process which involves enhancing the anatomical
    substance of the soil apropos improve its strength, durability by mixing with
    additives. Foundation of a structure on the soft clay soil may be responsible
    for the excessive settlement of the structure. Soil modification helps to decreasing
    the foundation cost by increasing bearing capacity. In this study, lime and polypropylene
    fibres were used with soil to observe its effect on the bearing capacity. Different
    concentration of lime (0 to 15%) by weight of soil and 2% polypropylene fibres
    by weight of lime were mixed with different soil samples according to the soil
    categories like sandy and clay and silt soil. The necessary parameters of the
    soil were determined and unconfined compressive strength of the soil was also
    measured by laboratory testing machine with different curing days. The result
    revealed the optimum value of the unconfined compressive strength was obtained
    for the concentration of 10% lime for clay and silt soil on the other hand 7.5%
    for the sandy soil.
