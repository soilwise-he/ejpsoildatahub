  title: "Long-term phytomanagement with compost and a sunflower \u2013 Tobacco rotation\
    \ influences the structural microbial diversity of a Cu-contaminated soil"
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;At a former wood preservation site contaminated with Cu, various phytomanagement
    options have been assessed in the last decade through physicochemical, ecotoxicological
    and biological assays. In a field trial at this site, phytomanagement with a crop
    rotation based on tobacco and sunflower, combined with the incorporation of compost
    and dolomitic limestone, has proved to be efficient in Cu-associated risk mitigation,
    ecological soil functions recovery and net gain of economic and social benefits.
    To demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of phytomanagement,
    we assessed here the influence of this remediation option on the diversity, composition
    and structure of microbial communities over time, through a metabarcoding approach.
    After 9 years of phytomanagement, no overall effect was identified on microbial
    diversity; the soil amendments, notably the repeated compost application, led
    to shifts in soil microbial populations. This phytomanagement option induced changes
    in the composition of soil microbial communities, promoting the growth of microbial
    groups belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, many being involved in N cycling. Populations
    of Nitrososphaeria, which are crucial in nitrification, as well as taxa from phyla
    Planctomycetacia, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes, which are tolerant to metal
    contamination and adapted to oligotrophic soil conditions, decreased in amended
    phytomanaged plots. Our study provides an insight into population dynamics within
    soil microbial communities under long-term phytomanagement, in line with the assessment
    of soil ecological functions and their recovery.&lt;br&gt;
