  title: Lead Contamination Of Soil In Baghdad, Iraq
  abstract: 'Lead (Pb) levels in soils for different sites in Baghdad were determined
    to assess the soil contamination by lead in the city. Around sixty-three soil
    samples were collected as indicator of Pb pollution from different sources. The
    mean Pb concentrations in the soils ranging from 15 mg Pb/kg at the bus station,
    800-2300 mg Pb/kg in the city center, and 8-350 mg Pb/kg along the highway. Value
    up to 9350 mg Pb/kg found in the soils near the batteries factory.


    The mean Pb concentrations in the city centre were substantially higher than values
    found in other places; they were also higher than the standards for soil in residential
    areas and in playgrounds for children. Pb soil concentrations at the downwind
    sides were some 60% higher than the upwind area. Bioavailable Pb (extracted with
    0.04 M Na2EDTA solution) was also determined in this study. This parameter showed
    significant correlation with total Pb.


    Control measures should be adopted to reduce emissions of mobile-exhaust Pb and
    lead smelters. Nearby pollution sources such as highways, major streets, and batteries
    factories should be considered when locating new, schools and land use projects.
    At the same time, vegetable production and animal grazing should also be avoided
    in areas near highways.'
