  title: Correlations between soil sodicity and foliar symptom of wood decay of kiwifruit
  abstract: Wood decay of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a relatively new disease
    of complex etiology. This disease has gained much attention in recent years because
    it has become widespread in kiwifruit-growing areas. Foliar symptoms of the disease
    are associated with toxins produced by pathogens and develop presumably in response
    to certain environmental and physiological factors. Vineyard surveys were conducted
    over nine years in a main Italian kiwifruit growing area, to investigate a potential
    correlation between soil sodicity and the occurrence of leaf symptoms. Greenhouse
    trials were also carried out to evaluate physiological parameters potentially
    associated with the symptoms, as transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, net
    photosynthesis, and water potential of potted vines grown with different levels
    of soil sodicity. In the vineyard trials, an increase in soil sodicity significantly
    augmented the incidence of wood decay of kiwifruit. Higher levels of soil sodicity
    correlated to increased transpiration and decreased water potential in plant tissues,
    which in turn can increase toxin translocation and accumulation in the leaves.
