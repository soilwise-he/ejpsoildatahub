  title: 'Gentle remediation options for soil with mixed chromium (VI) and lindane
    pollution: biostimulation, bioaugmentation, phytoremediation and vermiremediation'
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Gentle Remediation Options (GROs), such as biostimulation, bioaugmentation,
    phytoremediation and vermiremediation, are cost-effective and environmentally-friendly
    solutions for soils simultaneously polluted with organic and inorganic compounds.
    This study assessed the individual and combined effectiveness of GROs in recovering
    the health of a soil artificially polluted with hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and
    lindane. A greenhouse experiment was performed using organically-amended vs. non-amended
    mixed polluted soils. All soils received the following treatments: (i) no treatment;
    (ii) bioaugmentation with an actinobacteria consortium; (iii) vermiremediation
    with Eisenia fetida; (iv) phytoremediation with Brassica napus; (v) bioaugmentation
    + vermiremediation; (vi) bioaugmentation + phytoremediation; and (vii) bioaugmentation
    + vermiremediation + phytoremediation. Soil health recovery was determined based
    on Cr(VI) and lindane concentrations, microbial properties and toxicity bioassays
    with plants and worms. Cr(VI) pollution caused high toxicity, but some GROs were
    able to partly recover soil health: (i) the organic amendment decreased Cr(VI)
    concentrations, alleviating toxicity; (ii) the actinobacteria consortium was effective
    at removing both Cr(VI) and lindane; (iii) B. napus and E. fetida had a positive
    effect on the removal of pollutants and improved microbial properties. The combination
    of the organic amendment, B. napus, E. fetida and the actinobacteria consortium
    was the most effective strategy. &copy; 2020 The Authors&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
