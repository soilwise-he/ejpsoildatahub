  title: Incorporation Of Sole And Amended Agro-Industrial Biomass For Soil Bulk Density
    And Poposity Improvement, Root Growth And Pod Yield Of Okra (Abelmoschus Esculentum
    Moench L)
  abstract: "An investigation was carried out in Akure, Nigeria on the effect of sole\
    \ and fortified agro-industrial biomass for improving soil bulk density and porosity\
    \ improvement, root growth and pod yield of okra (<em>Abelmoschus esculentum L</em>)\n\
    \n \n\nThe 20 organic fertilizer treatments were compared to chemical fertilizers\
    \ (NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer )  and a control (no fertilizer; no manure), replicated\
    \ four times and arranged in a randomized complete block design.\n\n \n\nThe results\
    \ showed that the application of 6/ha of agro-industrial biomass in sole forms\
    \ or fortified with goat, pig and poultry manure increased significantly (P&lt;0.05)\
    \ the soil porosity, root growth and pod yield of okra compared to the control\
    \ treatment.  The soil bulk density was also reduced significantly compared to\
    \ the control treatment.\n\n \n\nThe amended <em>woodash, spentgrain</em>, <em>cocoa\
    \ husk</em>, <em>ricebran</em> and sawdust with pig, goat and poultry manure reduced\
    \ the soil bulk density values more than their ordinary forms.  The NPK fertilizer\
    \ and the control plots had relatively high bulk density and low porosity values.\n\
    \n \n\n <em>Spentgrain</em> applied sole or amended with manure most reduced the\
    \ soil bulk density followed by <em>woodash</em>, cocoa husk, <em>ricebran</em>\
    \ and sawdust respectively.  This explained why the <em>spentgrain</em> (sole\
    \ and amended forms) treatments had the best soil porosity, root growth and pod\
    \ yield of okra compared to others.\n\n \n\nThe linear correlation \u201Cr\u201D\
    \ values between root length and pod yield of2 okra were 0.40, 0.45, 0.57 and\
    \ 0.68 at 1% level for crop 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively showing that it is an\
    \ important factor in the determination of okra pod weight.\n\n \n\n <em>Spentgrain</em>\
    \ applied sole or amended with animal manure was very useful in improving soil\
    \ physical properties of a lowly fertile humid soils for sustainable agriculture."
