  title: Sorption of Carbofuran (2,3-Dihydro-2,2-dimethylbenzofuranylmethylcarbamate)
    by Soil
  abstract: Department of Agricultural Chemistry &amp; Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture,
    Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur-741 252 <em>Manuscript received
    28 June 1996, revised 3 April 1997, accepted 23 October 1997</em> Sorption of
    the insecticide Carbofuran by four different soils of West Bengal have been investigated.
    Adsorption equilibria studies indicated that adsorption of the insecticide by
    soil was complete within 3 h. The adsorption isotherm yielding S-shaped curve
    could be described by Frundlich equation. The order of adsorption capacity (K)
    of the soils for Carbofuran has been evaluated from the values of constant K and
    1/<em>\(n\)</em>. Freundlich K values have been correlated with organic matter
    (<em>r </em>= 0.951) and surface area (<em>r</em> = 0.957) of the soils. Thermodynamic
    parameters have been evaluated which indicate the process to be spontaneous but
    more or less physical in nature.
