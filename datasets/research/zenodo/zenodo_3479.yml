  title: Radiological Risk Assessment In Soil Samples Of Western Haryana, India
  abstract: 'The measurements of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K using

    gamma spectrometry and radon concentration and exhalation rates

    measurements using solid state nuclear track (LR-115, Type-II

    plastic) detectors are used to asses a first order exposure risk for the

    persons residing in Fatehbad and Hissar districts of Western Haryana,

    India. The concentration of Radium, Thorium and Potassium in the

    soil samples varies from 13.37 Bq m-3 to 24.67 Bq m-3, 34.67 Bq m-3

    to 67.34 Bq m-3 and 298.78 Bq m-3 to 405.67 Bq m-3 respectively

    with average values of 18.78, 47.35 and 361.57 Bq m-3 respectively.

    The radium equivalent activity (Raeq) calculated for the same soil

    samples varies from 92.72 Bq m-3 to 140.6 Bq m-3 with an average

    value of 111.80 Bq m-3. The values of absorbed dose and annual

    effective dose (indoors and outdoors) are found to vary from 44.18

    nGy h-1 to 65.23 nGy h-1, 0.22 mSv y-1 to 0.32 mSv y-1 and 0.05 mSv

    y-1 to 0.08 mSv y-1 respectively. The radon concentration and

    exhalation rates have also been reported. The radium equivalent

    activities in all the soil samples were found to be lower than the limit

    (370 Bq kg-1) set in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and

    Development (OECD) report and the value of Hex in all the samples

    is less than unity.'
