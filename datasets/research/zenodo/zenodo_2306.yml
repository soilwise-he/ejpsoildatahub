  title: The variability of soil as the basis for determining fertilization recommendation
    for rice in North Sumatra, Indonesia
  abstract: "Soil fertility and soil units at a detailed scale are needed to determine\
    \ site-specific nutrient management. The objective of the study was to describe\
    \ the variability of lowland rice fertility and fertilizer recommendation in North\
    \ Sumatra. Field research was investigated at Pasar Miring Experimental Station,\
    \ Deli Serdang District, North Sumatra Province (latitude: 3\xB0, 29', 57''N,\
    \ longitude: 98\xB0, 54', 23'' m.a.s.l.) puddled soil with a land area of 15.33\
    \ ha for the period August-December 2020. The study was preceded by a work desk,\
    \ field survey, analysis of soil samples in the laboratory, data processing, and\
    \ reporting. GIS applications are used for data processing. The soil series is\
    \ distinguished by the type and arrangement of horizons, colors, textures, structures,\
    \ consistency, soil reactions of each horizon, other soil chemical properties,\
    \ and mineral properties of each horizon. The results showed that (1) Soil in\
    \ the study area was tuff acid dacite with above alluvium cover material was sand\
    \ and loam that it required lime and organic material to improve soil structure,\
    \ especially on a bit rough to rough textures (2) Soil classification in the experimental\
    \ area was Inceptisols ordo, Aquepts suborder, Endoaquepts group, Typic Endoaquepts\
    \ subgroup, and Kotasan 1, Kotasan 2, Kotasan 3, Jaharum B1, and Jaharum B2 series;\
    \ (3) Soil fertility map scale of 1: 2000 at depth 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm were divided\
    \ into three categories i.e. inherent potential of soil fertility status (IP)\
    \ with high to very low grade, organic matter and soil N status (OM) with very\
    \ high to very low class, as well as P availability status (AP) with very high\
    \ to medium grade; (4). Applied mineral soil + ash empty fruit bunches of palm\
    \ oil increased rice production up to 1.3 t ha-1 (15%)."
