  title: Crop Diversification Effects on Soil Aggregation and Aggregate-Associated
    Carbon and Nitrogen in Short-Term Rainfed Olive Groves under SemiaridMediterranean
    Conditions
  abstract: "Soil particle aggregation and their associated carbon (C) and nitrogen\
    \ (N) content can<br> provide valuable diagnostic indicators of changes in soil\
    \ properties in response to the implementation<br> of different agricultural management\
    \ practices. In this sense, there is limited knowledge regarding the<br> impact\
    \ of intercropping on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools\
    \ in aggregates. This<br> study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect (4 years)\
    \ of three crop diversifications in rainfed olive<br> orchards on soil aggregation,\
    \ SOC and TN concentration and SOC stocks (SOC-S) under semi-arid<br> Mediterranean\
    \ conditions. Olive orchards were diversified with Crocus sativus (D-S), Vicia\
    \ sativa and<br> Avena sativa in rotation (D-O) and Lavandula x intermedia (D-L)\
    \ and compared with monocropping<br> system (CT). Soil samples were collected\
    \ at two depths (0\u201310 and 10\u201330 cm) and analysed for soil<br> aggregate\
    \ mass, SOC and TN content in aggregate-size fractions obtained by the wet-sieving\
    \ method.<br> Changes caused by crop diversifications on SOC-S were also determined.\
    \ Overall, after 4 years,<br> a reduction in aggregation values was observed.\
    \ However, D-S increased the macroaggregates<br> (&gt;250 m) percentage, Mean\
    \ Weigh Diameter values, and Geometric Mean Value in the 0\u201310 cm.<br> Across\
    \ treatments, aggregate-associated C in 0\u201310 cm was higher in the D-S treatment,\
    \ while in<br> the 10\u201330 cm soil layer, the greatest values were found in\
    \ CT. Regarding the SOC-S, after 4 years,<br> significant losses were recorded\
    \ under CT management in 0\u201310 cm (\U001000001.21 Mg ha\U001000001) and 10\u2013\
    30 cm<br> (\U001000000.84 Mg ha\U001000001), while D-O and D-L showed similar\
    \ values to those obtained at the beginning of the<br> study. The highest increases\
    \ in SOC-S were found in D-S, with an increase of 5.88% in the 0\u201310 cm<br>\
    \ and 14.47% in the 10\u201330 cm. Our results showed the high potential of the\
    \ diversified cropping system<br> to increase soil stability and SOC sequestration."
