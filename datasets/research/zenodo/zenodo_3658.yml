  title: Growth and Yield of Seedless Watermelon Plants in Response to Soil Amendment
    Application
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This research aims to evaluate the effect of soil amendment concentration
    on the growth and yield of seedless watermelon plants. This research was carried
    out at the agricultural land that located in Kumendung Village, Muncar District,
    Banyuwangi Regency, East Java Province, Indonesia. Four soil amendment concentrations
    (P1: 7.5 ml/liter, P2: 10 ml/liter, P3: 12.5 ml/liter, P4: 15 ml/liter) were tested
    on 132 watermelon plants in a randomized block experimental design. The results
    showed that the concentration of soil amendment affected the nutrient content
    of the soil with the highest concentrations in P1 and P3. Even though soil pH
    is relatively stable, the concentration of soil amendment affects the nitrogen
    (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) content in the soil. In terms of plant growth,
    P3 concentration consistently provide a better plant height at various stages
    of observation. The fruit yield is also affected by the used of concentration
    of soil amendment, P3 treatment produces the highest fruit weight and fruit yield
    of P1 concentration have the highest level of sweetness. Based on the observation
    results, application of the right soil amendment concentration will increase growth
    and yield of seedless watermelon, which in this study the best yield obtained
    with P3 (12.5 ml/liter) application. These results could give an important implication
    to improving the productivity of seedless watermelon cultivation, especially in
    areas that have less fertile soil, such as Kumendung Village, Banyuwangi.&lt;/p&gt;'
