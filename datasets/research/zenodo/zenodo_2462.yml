  title: Influence of soil physicochemical parameters on species composition and structure
    in the Togo Plateau Forest Reserve in Ghana
  abstract: "Soil-Species correlation studies help in understanding the ecology of\
    \ plateau ecosystems. However, this information is scarse thereby posing a challenge\
    \ in their effective management in Ghana. Hence, the study on the influence of\
    \ soil physicochemical parameters on species composition and structure in the\
    \ six fringed communities which constitute the focus of the study: Bowuri (BO),\
    \ Nkonya (NK), Akpafu (AK), Santrokofi (SA), Hohoe (HH) and Alavanyo (AL) in the\
    \ Togo Plateau Forest Reserve in Ghana. Soil and vegetation parameters were recorded\
    \ in a total of 180 plots (each measuring 25m \xD7 25m) demarcated across the\
    \ communities and analyzed. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) results showed\
    \ that pH, OC, TN, OM, TCa, TMg, TK, Na, T.E.B, ex. Acidity, ECEC, Base sat, AVI\
    \ \u2013 P (ppmP), Sand and Silt were the drivers of trees, saplings and seedlings\
    \ composition and structure (including density, richness, shannon, evenness and\
    \ basal area (BA)) on the plateau. This vegetation attributes were seen to be\
    \ highest and more correlated with soil parameters for BO, NK and AK occupying\
    \ lowland areas and lowest in the SA, HH and AL occupying highland areas of the\
    \ plateau. The soil is somewhat weak acidic to neutral, with a pH ranging between\
    \ 4.17 and 7.06. The CV values revealed Base sat showing lowest values (c.v.&lt;15%),\
    \ with moderate (c.v.=34%-15%) for TK and highest (c.v.\u02C335%) for TCa, TMg,\
    \ Na, T.E.B, EX. ACIDITY and ECEC, AVI-P1. This study provides a better understanding\
    \ of the current status of this plateau in Ghana."
