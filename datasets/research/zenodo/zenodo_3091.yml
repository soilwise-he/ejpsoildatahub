  - '&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The use of the extract obtained as a leaching of the coconut fiber (Cocos
    nucifera) as a biostimulant for the remediation of a savanna soil contaminated
    with heavy oil was evaluated. Through standardized procedures, the main characteristics
    of the extract, oil and soil were obtained. The soil was contaminated with 100
    mL of heavy oil per kilogram. Four experimental units of 1 kg each were established,
    leaving the first as a pattern without treatment and 3 treated with extract in
    proportions of 50, 100 and 150 mL, each with 3 replicates distributed at random.
    The units were left under controlled laboratory conditions and the percentage
    of oils and fats and the pH were determined every 7 days by means of the EPA 9071b
    and ASTM D4972 standards, until complying with the Venezuelan standard Decree
    2635. It was concluded by means of a Factorial ANOVA analysis, that both the volume
    of extract applied and the exposure time exert a statistically significant influence
    on the percentage of oils and fats and the pH with 95% confidence level. All soil
    units treated with extract reached the limit value established in Decree 2635
    at 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;'
