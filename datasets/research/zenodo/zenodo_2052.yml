  title: Studies on physico-chemical parameters in different soil samples from Erode
    District, Tamil Nadu, India
  abstract: Soil physicochemical properties can be regarded as an important tool to
    assess soil health, which further form a base for biological activity in soil.
    These soil physicochemical properties are comparable in identical land-uses. However,
    the changes in land-use types and their effects on soil physicochemical properties
    are largely debates and rather unclear. Soil serves as an important thing in agriculture
    because this determines the plant growth and health. The present circumstance
    of industrialization and urbanization has taken a toll on environment, polluting
    the soil, air and water. Pollution as well as global warming has exhibited detrimental
    effects on our natural resources of soil becomes the inexplicable. Failing monsoon
    rains due to climatic changes, population explosion, and depletion of natural
    water and soil resources such as ground soil, agricultural soil as well as intentional
    man-made pollution of agriculture pesticide to soil scarcity. Even the scarcely
    available water is located by contaminants and pollutants which include mutagens,
    carcinogens, and pathogenic microbes affecting all the file forms affecting the
    ecological balance. Considering the above mentioned problem criteria, a part of
    the present work has been designed to analyze the quality of ground soil around
    the industrial premises. For this objective, we have collected different types
    of soil samples from various locations in and around sathyamangalam area in Erode
    District focusing on quite far away from industrial premises considering the concepts
    of leaching. Basic physio-chemical properties of soil colour, pH, chloride, sulphate,
    phosphate, silicate, nitrate, moisture, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium using
    specific techniques used in laboratory for the samples have been analyzed by APHA
    standards. These analysis help in the addition of the nutrients of the soil and
    provide a nutritive indicator value of the sampling sites. Highest possibility
    of soil quality issues which affects the day to day consumption of soil samples
    for the domestic needs of the people has been emphasized.
