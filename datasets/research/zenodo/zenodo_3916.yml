  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is the most crucial resource on which agriculture is based.
    Proper management of this valuable resource is vital to sustain long-term agricultural
    productivity. Farmers&rsquo; knowledge level and adoption of soil management practices
    have influenced agricultural productivity. This study therefore, investigated
    the farmers&rsquo; knowledge gap and adoption of soil conservation practices in
    North Central Nigeria. A four-stage random sampling technique was adopted for
    selecting 960 respondents from all the six states for the study. Structured questionnaire
    and interview schedule were used to elicit information from the respondents. Data
    collected were analyzed with both descriptive and inferential statistics such
    as frequency counts, percentages, and mean, standard deviation, and knowledge
    gap and adoption indexes. The overall results for the six states showed that 45.3%
    had low knowledge gap, 43.4% had medium knowledge gap, and only 11.3% had high
    and wider knowledge gap of soil conservation practices. Benue have the largest
    (52.3%) number of farmers with the lowest knowledge gap on soil conservation practices.
    Results showed that 37.2 and 38.6% of respondents had low and moderate adoption
    rate, respectively, while only 24.2% had high adoption rate of soil conservation
    practices. State-wise, Benue (0.74) had the highest adoption rate while Kogi (0.33)
    had the lowest. Adoption rate of soil conservation practices is significantly
    influenced by farmers&rsquo; knowledge level at varying degree. It is concluded
    that farmers&rsquo; knowledge gap and adoption of soil conservation practices
    ranges between low and medium with wide knowledge gap were found mostly in the
    areas of terracing, contour farming, conservation tillage, and vegetative barriers.
    The study recommend that training with result demonstration through agricultural
    extension services should be organized for farmers on soil conservation practices
    to bridge their knowledge gap, especially in the areas where wider gap was found
    and increases its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;'
