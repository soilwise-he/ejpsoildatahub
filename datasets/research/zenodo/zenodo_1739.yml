  title: Kinetics of bioremediation of crude oil polluted soil using potato peels
    as bio-stimulant
  abstract: "This study investigated the utilization of bio-stimulant derived from\
    \ agro-based resource (potato peels) in the remediation of crude-oil contaminated\
    \ soil. At a constant proportion of crude oil contamination, varying concentration\
    \ of the biostimulant (5ml, 10ml, 15ml and 20ml) were introduced for the treatment\
    \ (bioremediation and degradation) of the contaminated sites and left for a degradation\
    \ period in plastic vessels. Periodic sampling of soil from each vessel was carried\
    \ out at 5 days interval for total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis. Results indicated\
    \ that after 20 days of exposure to the organic biostimulants, biodegradation\
    \ of crude oil contaminated soil samples was directly proportional to the potato\
    \ peels dosage.\_ The potato peels (PO) derived biostimulant recorded 94.43 percentage\
    \ degradation at 20ml dosage and 20 days contact time. Oil contaminated soil samples\
    \ amended potato peels biostimulant recorded half-life of 0.702day and biodegradation\
    \ rate constants of 0.986day-1. The zero order kinetic model best described the\
    \ bioremediation kinetic behaviour of the bioremediation process. The findings\
    \ of this research suggest that potato peels can be used as an effective organic\
    \ amendment for the biodegradation of crude oil contaminated soil."
