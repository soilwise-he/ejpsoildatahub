  title: Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction Analysis Of Reinforced Concrete Buildings
  abstract: 'The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of

    soil-structure interaction (SSI) on the modal characteristics and on

    the dynamic response of current structures. The objective is on the

    overall behaviour of a real structure of five storeys reinforced

    concrete (R/C) building typically encountered in Algeria. Sensitivity

    studies are undertaken in order to study the effects of frequency

    content of the input motion, frequency of the soil-structure system,

    rigidity and depth of the soil layer on the dynamic response of such

    structures. This investigation indicated that the rigidity of the soil

    layer is the predominant factor in soil-structure interaction and its

    increases would definitely reduce the deformation in the R/C

    structure. On the other hand, increasing the period of the underlying

    soil will cause an increase in the lateral displacements at story levels

    and create irregularity in the distribution of story shears. Possible

    resonance between the frequency content of the input motion and soil

    could also play an important role in increasing the structural

    response.'
