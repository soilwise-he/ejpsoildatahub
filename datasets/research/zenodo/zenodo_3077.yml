  title: 'Microbial Architects of the Cold Deserts: A Comprehensive Research of Biological
    Soil Crusts in the High-Altitudinal Cold Deserts of the Western Himalayas'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Our research has focused on Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs) in\
    \ the Western Himalayas, specifically in Tibetan Plateau and Karakoram (Ladakh,\
    \ India) along the elevation gradient spanning a range of 4300\u20136000 m a.s.l.\
    \ where habitats like cold deserts, steppes, alpine and subnival vegetation, as\
    \ well as primary successional stages behind retreating glaciers are present.\
    \ These regions are characterised by extensive development of BSCs, with cyanobacteria\
    \ as the dominant component. BSCs are of great significance for the sustainability\
    \ and development of ecosystems of arid regions worldwide. Their activity is limited\
    \ to brief periods when precipitation or dew hydrates microbial cells, enabling\
    \ metabolic activity. Despite the crucial role played by these phototrophic microbial\
    \ communities in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide, remote mountain regions\
    \ like the Tibetian Tibetan Plateau and Karakoram have received limited attention\
    \ in this regard. More than 15 years long research allowed us to determine several\
    \ critical aspects of BSCs' activity and performance:&lt;/p&gt;We conducted laboratory\
    \ and in-situ experiments\_Fig. 1\_to assess the potential photosynthetic and\
    \ heterotrophic activity of BSCs from high-altitude cold deserts. The experiments\
    \ involved measuring the production and consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;\
    \ and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by BSCs under various temperature and moisture\
    \ conditions, as well as light intensity. By manipulating these factors, we could\
    \ differentiate the activities of heterotrophs and autotrophs within the BSCs.\
    \ The results of these experiments were then analysed in the context of soil nutrient\
    \ stoichiometry, phylogenetic structure, and microbial community biomass. Using\
    \ these data, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model to predict the overall\
    \ metabolic activity of BSCs in response to the major climatic drivers: temperature\
    \ and moisture. This knowledge could help us to predict the reaction of BSC to\
    \ climatic changes and reveal if the arid areas in Western Himalayas will act\
    \ as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources or sink.We further investigated the composition\
    \ and content of pigments in microbial soil communities across various habitats\
    \ along the elevation gradient in the Tibetan Plateau (Rehakova and Capkova 2019).\
    \ Soil microbes have evolved complex metabolic strategies, such as producing photoprotective\
    \ and photosynthetic pigments, to survive the environmental stress caused by high\
    \ UV radiation, fluctuating temperatures, and drought.We also examined the effects\
    \ of environmental factors such as altitude, mountain range, and soil physico-chemical\
    \ parameters on the composition and biovolume of phototrophs which dominate the\
    \ BSc in the studied region (\u0158eh\xE1kov\xE1 2011, Janatkov\xE1 and \u0158\
    eh\xE1kov\xE1 2013). This was accomplished through multivariate redundancy analysis\
    \ and variance partitioning. Interestingly, the phylogenetic diversity and morphotypes'\
    \ composition were similar between the Karakoram and Tibetan Plateau (\u010Capkov\xE1\
    \ 2015). Our investigation represents the first recorded assessment of the phylogenetic\
    \ diversity of cyanobacterial communities within biological soil crusts in the\
    \ Western Himalayas, specifically at altitudes exceeding 5000 m."
