  title: Study On Characteristic Of Laterite Soil With Lime Stabilization As A Road
    Foundation
  abstract: 'Regional growth and development led to an increase in infrastructure
    especially roads. Along with that, material requirements as the road foundation
    also increased. Meanwhile, the number of qualified materials in certain areas
    is limited, difficult to obtain and expensive. Therefore, efforts are required
    to exploit the potential of local soils as a<br>

    qualified road foundation material. One of them is laterite soil which is only
    wasted from mining activities. This study aims to analyze and produce the characteristics
    of laterite soil with lime stabilization to be used as a road foundation. Physical
    and mechanical properties, mineral content, and chemical composition, obtained
    from laboratory testing. Meanwhile, to obtain soil bearing capacity, the physical
    model of the road foundation was examined. The addition of lime with compositions
    of 3, 5, 7, and 10% at maximum dry density from Proctor standard test, then cured
    to 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before testing. Subsequently, the soil mixture is fed
    into the test tub with length (L) = 8m, width (W) = 2m, and height (H) = 2.5m.
    The physical model of road foundation consists of a subgrade soil with 1.5 m thickness
    and above the subgrade is placed lime treated base with 0.1 m thickness. Dial
    gauge to read the magnitute of vertical deformation occurs when loading is placed
    on surface with 0.2 m distance. Furthermore, static loading test on each mixture
    of lime treated base. The results show that, stabilization of 10% lime for 28
    days curing time yields the strength and bearing capacity of the soil three times
    higher than soil before stabilization. Subgrade modulus increased significantly
    with increasing of lime content and curing time. Comparing the relation of subgrade
    modulus and CBR values for common soil and sediment soil with cement stabilization,
    it was found that performance of laterite soil with lime stabilization is better
    than sediment soil with cement stabilization and approaching of common soil. It
    is concluded that laterite soil with lime stabilization has potential as a road
    foundation.'
