  title: Assessment of Physicochemical Properties of Soil under Different Land Use
    Types at Wuye Gose Sub-Watershed, North Shoa Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia
  abstract: "<em>Assessing soil physicochemical properties and subsequent implication\
    \ on soil fertility is essential for understanding the influence of agro-ecosystem\
    \ transformation on agricultural soil quality and productivity. A study was conducted\
    \ at Wuye Gose sub-watershed, North Shoa Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia, to assess\
    \ the physicochemical properties of soil under different land use types. A total\
    \ of 12 disturbed soil samples were taken for soil physicochemical properties\
    \ determination and 24 undisturbed soil samples were taken for FC and BD determination\
    \ from 0-30 cm depth. Grazing, cultivated, homestead and forest lands were identified.\
    \ The soil samples were analyzed with standard laboratory procedures. All of the\
    \ analyzed soil physicochemical properties were varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05)\
    \ among land uses, except pH and exchangeable Na. Textural classes of grazing\
    \ land and cultivated land were loamy sand while it was sandy loam in homestead\
    \ land and forest land. The BD ranged from 1.51 (GL) to 1.13 g/cm3 (HL) and TP\
    \ varied 57.25 (HL) to 43.04% (GL). Soil water content at FC was ranged from (45.18)\
    \ in homestead to (36.35%v) in grazing land. Permanent wilting point, in %v, was\
    \ high (16.99) in homestead and forest to low (8.49) in grazing and cultivated\
    \ lands. Available water holding capacity was high (36.69) in homestead to low\
    \ (19.36%v) in grazing lands. The EC in d S m\u2212, 1 was high (0.420) in homestead\
    \ to low (0.055) in cultivated land uses. The SOC and TN, in %, were high (2.13)\
    \ in the forest to low (1.12) in cultivated and high (0.31) in the forest to low\
    \ (0.12) in cultivated and homestead lands, respectively. The C: N was high (18.91)\
    \ in the forest to low (10.07) in cultivated lands. The Av. P was high (2.52)\
    \ in homestead to low (0.86 mg/kg) in cultivated lands. The CEC, exchangeable\
    \ Ca, Mg, K and TEB, in cmol (+) kg \u22121, were high (27.87) in homestead to\
    \ low (9.28) in grazing, high (2.83) in homestead to low (1.27) in cultivated,\
    \ high (5.45) in forest to low (1.81) in cultivated, high (2.00) in homestead\
    \ to low (0.17) in cultivated and high (10.59) in homestead to low (3.63) in cultivated\
    \ lands, respectively. The ranges of EDTA extractable Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn, in mg/kg,\
    \ were 18.10 to 6.42, 12.20 to 6.87, 3.59 to 1.89, and 3.74 to 0.32, respectively.\
    \ Most of the soil physicochemical properties of the study area varied from land\
    \ use to land uses. In conclusion, fertility status varies as homestead land &gt;\
    \ forest land &gt; grazing land &gt; cultivated lands in the study area. Therefore,\
    \ soil physicochemical management in CL and GL should be highly needed for the\
    \ study area. For future research direction, soil physicochemical assessment should\
    \ be done frequently by taking into account the site-soil-crop interaction since\
    \ the soil is a dynamic and complex system.</em>"
