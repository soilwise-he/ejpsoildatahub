  title: Studies the Effects of Imidacloprid on Enzymatic Activities in Clay Loam
    Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In vivo experiment was conducted for toxicity evaluation of
    Imidacloprid on soil enzyme activities arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase
    activities in the treated soil under control condition for 60 days at different
    application rate 3.97&micro;g mL FR , 7.94&micro;g mL 2FR and 39.7&micro;g mL
    10FR . Imidacloprid has significant toxic at 2FR and 10FR doses but not on the
    recommended field rate FR . Acid phosphatase activity was stimulated at FR rate,
    whereas at higher dose 10FR inhibited the activity. A significant drop of dehydrogenase
    activity was observed irrespective of doses at 30 days of application and after
    that the enzymatic activity slowly increased. Application of Imidacloprid at FR
    to agriculture soil of Tripura is not likely to show any detrimental effects on
    soil acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase activities but at higher elevated doses
    there appear some harmful effects which was also very much transient. Aloke Purkait
