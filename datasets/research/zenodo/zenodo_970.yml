  title: X-RAY DIFFRACTION OF SOIL SAMPLES FROM OKWUTA IBEKU UMUAHIA, NIGERIA
  abstract: "Soil samples in Okwuta Ibeku Umuahia were characterized for their mineralogical\
    \ potentials. \n\nX-ray diffraction was used in the mineralogical characterization.\
    \ Result obtained was analyzed\n\nusing Bragg-Wolf equation and International\
    \ Centre for diffraction data software. Bragg\u2019s\n\nequation was used to find\
    \ the d-value corresponding to Bragg\u2019s angles. The d-values which \n\nwere\
    \ obtained from samples were compared with standard values. The d-spacing for\
    \ the most\n\nintense peaks in the x-ray diffraction pattern are 4.27013, 3.35360\
    \ and 1.82025\xC5.  The result\n\nshowed that the sample contained \u03B1-quartz\
    \ (SiO2) an hexagonal crystal system with Space\n\ngroup P3221, a (\xC5) : 4.9209,\
    \ b (\xC5):4.9209, c (\xC5): 5.4091, alpha (\xB0): 90.0000 beta (\xB0):90.0000,\n\
    \ngamma (\xB0):120.0000, volume of cell (10^6 pm^3):113.43 , Z: 3.00 ,RIR: 2.99"
