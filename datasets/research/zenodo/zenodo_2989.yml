  title: Modelling of the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) Degradation during the
    Bioremediation of Crude oil Polluted soil using Cow dung and wire crotons
  abstract: The contamination of soil due to activities involved in crude oil exploration
    and production, and oil spillage<br> emanating from pipeline vandalization, sabotage,
    theft, corrosion of pipeline and the enterprises of artisanal<br> refineries pose
    health and ecological problems. This is especially as crude oil contains chemical
    compounds which<br> are grouped into the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH), and
    known to be toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic.<br> Bioremediation is currently
    being explored as a cost effective and environmentally friendly methods of remediating<br>
    the soil from this contaminant. Thus, the current work is aimed at developing
    a mathematical model for the<br> bioremediation process. This was carried out
    while assuming that the process of degradation is a first order<br> reaction,
    and the principle of the law of conservation of mass was applied. A linear model
    (<br> ) was developed relating the instantaneous concentration of TPH, initial<br>
    concentration of TPH and time duration of the bioremediation. The model fitted
    well to the experimental data as<br> shown by the result of the statistical analysis
    where the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed a p-value of 0.004<br> suggesting
    that the model is statistically significant. The p-values of the model variables
    such as time duration of<br> the bioremediation was 0.004, this suggested that
    the variable is significant. The model can be used as a supporting<br> tool in
    the management of the biodegradation of TPH to predict the degradation concentration
    of TPH during the<br> bioremediation process at ambient condition of temperature
    and pressure using cow dung, wire croton and their<br> combination as a carbon
    source.<br>
