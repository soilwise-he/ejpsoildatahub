  title: Accumulation of Heavy Metals in Soil and Their Transfer to Tissues of Azadirachta
    indica Collected from Akungba-Akoko, Nigeria
  abstract: "Levels of five heavy metals namely, cadmium, cobalt, iron, lead, and\
    \ zinc were determined in tissues (roots, leaves and stems) of <em>Azadirachta\
    \ indica</em> collected at different spots in Akungba-Akoko, (Nigeria). Transfer\
    \ coefficients of the elements into the plant tissues were also determined with\
    \ a view to quantifying the differences in bioavailability to the plant species.\
    \ The tissues were acid-digested and analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.\
    \ The levels (ppm) of heavy metals recorded in the roots, leaves and stems of\
    \ the plant respectively ranged: Cd (0.14 \u2013 0.34, 0.09 \u2013 0.20, 0.09\
    \ \u2013 0.33); Co (4.01 \u2013 5.48, 3.22 \u2013 5.14, 3.84 \u2013 5.40); Fe\
    \ (82.27 \u2013 137.98, 49.20 \u2013 160.10, 58.33 \u2013 116.62); Pb (0.50 \u2013\
    \ 0.57, 0.33 \u2013 0.97, 0.28 \u2013 0.48) and Zn (52.07 \u2013 149.94, 52.01\
    \ \u2013 113.73, 49.58 \u2013 127.05). Fe has highest concentration while Cd has\
    \ lowest concentration in all tissues analyzed. The stems of the plant showed\
    \ least bioaccumulation of most metals studied and hence most suitable for medicinal\
    \ purpose. The order of bioaccumulation by the leaves, stem barks, and roots of\
    \ <em>Azadirachta indica</em> followed the sequence Pb &lt; Cd &lt; Zn &lt; Fe\
    \ &lt; Co. Since metal uptake from plants is a major component of human exposure\
    \ via the food chain, vegetative parts of <em>Azadirachta indica</em> used for\
    \ therapeutic purposes should be collected far away from highways to reduce or\
    \ possibly eliminate health hazards associated with the ingestion of heavy metals."
