  title: Biological and biochemical properties in evaluation of forest soil quality
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using
    biological and biochemical parameters in the evaluation of forest soil quality
    and changes caused by land use. The study attempted to determine a relationship
    between the enzymatic activity of soil, the number of earthworms and soil physico-chemical
    properties. The study was carried out in central Poland in adjoining Forest Districts
    (Przedb&oacute;rz and Smardzewice). In soil samples taken from 12 research plots,
    basic physico-chemical properties, enzyme activity (dehydrogenase, urease) and
    density and biomass of earthworms were examined. Enzyme activity showed a large
    diversity within the forest site types studied. The correlations between the activity
    of the enzymes studied and C/N ratio indicated considerable importance of these
    enzymes in metabolism of essential elements of organic matter of forest soils.
    Urease and dehydrogenase activity and earthworm number showed susceptibility to
    soil pH, which confirmed relationships between enzyme activity and&lt;br /&gt;

    abundance of earthworms and soil pH in H2O and KCl.&lt;/p&gt;'
