  title: EFFECT OF NUTRIENT SOURCE ON SOIL FERTILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF COWPEA [Vigna
    unguiculata (L) WALP.]
  abstract: "<em>A greenhouse epxperiment was conducted at Pokhara, Nepal during summer\
    \ of 2018 to access the effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on soil fertility\
    \ and productivity of cowpea. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized\
    \ design with eight treatments and three replications. The treatments included\
    \ eight selected combination of organic and inorganic nutrient sources ( Farm\
    \ yard manure, Vermicompost, Poultry manure, Nitrogen Phosphorous and Potassium).\
    \ The physio- chemical properties of soil, nutrient uptake on yield attributes,\
    \ yield and growth parameters weere analyzed during the investigation . Result\
    \ indicated that soil soil fertility has been improved where the OM was increased\
    \ form 2.28-3.6% and P from 25.58 to 28.87 mg/kg in treatment containing organic\
    \ fertilizer while soil pH nd N% showing no significant difference among treatments.\
    \ Maximum N, P and K content in seed and straw was obtained with 50% N from vermicompost\
    \ @ 0.9t/ha + 50% N from inorganic fertilizer , however pod weight, pod girth\
    \ , straw yield, 100 seed weight were found non \u2013significant. Among growth\
    \ parameters, 50% N from vermi compost @ 0.9t/ha + 50% N from inorganic fertilizer\
    \ enhanced the growth parameters like plant height, number of leaves per plant.\
    \ Hoever number of branches, fresh weight of roots, noodles per plant was found\
    \ non significant.</em>"
