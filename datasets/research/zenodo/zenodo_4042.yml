  title: Metadata analysis to evaluate environmental impacts of wheat residues burning
    on soil quality in developing and developed countries
  abstract: The data used in this study, including wheat harvested area, grain production,
    grain yield, and residue biomass burning were collected from the FAO website (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GB).
    Data were from 1969 to 2018 for both Iran and Italy as examples of developing
    and developed countries, respectively. These data are annually submitted to FAO
    by national correspondents of ministries or institutions and are free access for
    all users through the FAO website at http://www.fao.org.
