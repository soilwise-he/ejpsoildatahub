  title: 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based Nickel Nutrient Content
    Analyzer in Soil: An Overview'
  abstract: <em>Nickel is a vital element required for the growth and development
    of plants; yet, its excessive accumulation may lead to toxicity. The precise quantification
    of nickel nutrient levels in soil is of paramount significance in order to ascertain
    the optimal nickel concentration required for plants to flourish. The conventional
    techniques used for assessing the nickel nutrient concentration in soil are characterised
    by a significant investment of time and labour. Additionally, the use of specialised
    equipment is necessary, and this might incur significant costs. The use of artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) presents a potentially advantageous
    methodology for the assessment of nickel nutrient levels in soil. Artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the capability to undergo training
    processes in order to discern patterns within soil data that might serve as indicators
    of nickel concentration. This enables the advancement of expeditious, precise,
    and economical techniques for assessing the concentration of nickel nutrients
    in soil. This study provides an overview of the present advancements in artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in nickel nutrient
    content analyzers for soil analysis. The article examines the benefits of using
    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in this context, while
    also delineating the remaining obstacles that need attention. The concepts of
    scalability and efficiency are crucial in several domains and industries. The
    distributed nature of Federated Learning enables the training of machine learning
    models in large-scale industrial processes, thereby mitigating problems related
    to scalability. Federated Learning enhances computational performance and enables
    manufacturers to use collective wisdom while minimising resource usage by circumventing
    centralised data storage. The abstract highlights the significance of Federated
    Learning in facilitating data-driven decision-making within the industrial sector.
    Through the use of knowledge derived from dispersed data sources, manufacturers
    have the ability to make choices that are more informed and more adaptable, resulting
    in enhanced productivity and a decrease in periods of operational inactivity.
