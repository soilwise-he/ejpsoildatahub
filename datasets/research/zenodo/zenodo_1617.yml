    Global Media'
  abstract: "The world longest war against terrorism is expected to end. The United\
    \ States of America is set to fully withdraw from Afghanistan in September 2021.This\
    \ study, informed by Galtung\u2019s model of War and Peace, examines how the New\
    \ York Times and China Daily depict this war and the recently initiated peace\
    \ process. Combined method of qualitative and quantitative contents analysis was\
    \ used and the two newspapers\u2019 coverage from September 2018 to August 2019\
    \ was chosen. 144 stories were extracted and 73 exemplar stories, which met the\
    \ selection criteria were studied. The findings show that both newspapers excessively\
    \ used elite-oriented and visible effects of war frames. The study also found\
    \ that the NYT uses demeaning language, portrayed the Taliban as a dominant force,\
    \ demoralized Afghan government and security forces; it also held the Afghan people\
    \ responsible for the war. Implications of this study are discussed."
