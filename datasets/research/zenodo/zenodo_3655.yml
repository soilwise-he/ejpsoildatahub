  title: A study on prediction of soil properties content based on machine learning
    models
  abstract: The Indian economy is dependent on the agricultural sector. Although focused
    on industrialization, agriculture remains an important sector of the Indian economy,
    both in terms of contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs for millions
    of people across the country. One of the key factors for productive agriculture
    is soil. The purpose of the work is to predict the type of terrain using data
    mining classification methods. Agricultural properties and soil ownership play
    a crucial role in agricultural decision-making. Now-a-days there is a need to
    study the nutrient status in lower horizons of the soil. Soil testing has played
    historical role in evaluating soil fertility maintenance and in sustainable agriculture.
    Soil testing shall also play its crucial role in precision agriculture. At present
    there is a need to develop basic inventory as per soil test basis and necessary
    information has to be built into the system for translating the results of soil
    test to achieve the crop production goal in new era. To achieve this goal Machine
    Learning approach is used for predicting the soil properties.
