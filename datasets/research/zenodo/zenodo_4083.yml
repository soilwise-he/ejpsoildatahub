  title: Geotechnical Investigation Of Soil Foundation For Ramps Of Dawar El-Tawheed
    Bridge In Jizan City, Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia
  abstract: The soil profile at site of the bridge project includes soft fine grained
    soil layer located between 5.0 m to 11.0 m in depth, it has high water content,
    low SPT no., and low bearing capacity. The clay layer induces high settlement
    due to surcharge application of earth embankment at ramp T1, ramp T2, and ramp
    T3 especially at heights from 9m right 3m. Calculated settlement for embankment
    heights less than 3m may be accepted regarding Saudi Code for soil and foundation.
    The soil and groundwater at the project site comprise high contents of sulfates
    and chlorides of high aggressively on concrete and steel bars, respectively. Regarding
    results of the study, it has been recommended to use stone column piles or new
    technology named PCC piles as soil improvement to improve the bearing capacity
    of the weak layer. The new technology is cast in-situ thin wall concrete pipe
    piles (PCC piles), it has economically advantageous and high workability. The
    technology can save time of implementation and cost of application is almost 30%
    of other types of piles.
