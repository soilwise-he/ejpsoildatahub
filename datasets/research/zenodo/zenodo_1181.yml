  title: Potential Of Biological Approaches For Soil Pest Control In Greenhouse Vegetable
    Crops
  abstract: "The production of vegetables in greenhouses results in continuous and\
    \ rhythmical supply of the market with fresh produce. It is characterized by innovation\
    \ and dynamic development. Besides positive sides, greenhouse vegetable production\
    \ has same negatives. Inability to apply balanced crop rotations and closed space\
    \ lead to worsening of the nutrient regime and rapid multiplication of pests.\
    \ Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), including the good plant protection practice\
    \ (GPPP) is necessary to be kept in order to prevent these negatives. Significant\
    \ disadvantages of chemical control, including the threat to human health and\
    \ the environment, transform the biological control in one of the most promising\
    \ alternatives. Recently a progress in the production of a number of biological\
    \ agents is observed and some of these products are already on the market.<br>\n\
    Biological control agents have a great influence on the regulation of the population\
    \ of root-knot nematodes and pathogens and they are applied in combination with\
    \ other strategies for management. The most common are:<br>\nBacillus spp. Species\
    \ from Bacillus genus are most commonly used as bio-pesticides to control disease\
    \ and plant nematodes. They could control the fungal pathogens through competition,\
    \ direct antibiosis and induced resistance. The most popular biological control\
    \ agents are B. subtilis, B. thuringiensi, B. amyloliquefasciens, B. firmus and\
    \ B. pumilus.<br>\nPseudomonas spp. Pseudomonads possess many qualities that make\
    \ them for biocontrol and growth-promoting agents. They produce a wide range of\
    \ bioactive metabolites - antibiotics siderophores, volatile and growth-promoting\
    \ substances. They enter into completion aggressively with other microorganisms\
    \ and they could adapt quickly to the environment.<br>\nPasteuria spp. The distribution\
    \ of Pasteuria spp. in the body of the nematode induces degeneration of the reproductive\
    \ tissues, and significantly reduces the fertility. Because of the high efficiency\
    \ and specificity to the host, P. penetrans is a potentially perfect agent for\
    \ biological control against economically important nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne.<br>\n\
    Paecilomyces lilacinus. This species parasitizes and subsequently kills eggs,\
    \ larvae and adults of various plant-parasitic nematodes - Meloidogyne spp., Radopholus\
    \ similis, Heterodera spp., Pratylenchus spp., Globodera spp.<br>\nTrichoderma\
    \ spp. Strains belonging to the Trichoderma genus have been identified as biological\
    \ control agents against plant diseases and nematodes. Some of these strains are\
    \ developed and registered as biofungicides. The species T. harzianum, T. viride,\
    \ T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. gamsii, T. polysporum are very effective as\
    \ biological control agents. Some strains demonstrate direct hyper-parasitic activity\
    \ against the pathogen, while in other strains the induction of resistance or\
    \ competition with pathogens for space and nutrients predominate. The Trichoderma\
    \ strains produce a great variety of lytic enzymes, which play an important role\
    \ in biocontrol. They showed antifungal activity towards a broad spectrum of fungal\
    \ pathogens (Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Alternaria, Ustilago, Venturia, Colletotrichum,\
    \ Pythium and Phytophthora).<br>\nOne of the main restrictive factors for the\
    \ widespread use of microbial biological control agents is their price compared\
    \ to the chemical fumigants. The practical application of bio-agents also requires\
    \ special knowledge and a set of specific conditions guaranteeing high efficiency\
    \ in their application. Microbial plant protection products are a subject of researches\
    \ in the \u201EMaritsa\u201D Vegetable Crops Research Institute - Plovdiv. Microorganisms\
    \ for bio-control of phytopathogens and nematodes - Trichoderma viride strain\
    \ T6; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain A1; Bacillus thuringiensis strain Bt1;\
    \ Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain 2/7 A are studied. The results show that the\
    \ use of micro-bioagents could lead to an effective control of the soil pathogens\
    \ and root-knot nematodes as well as to production free of pesticide. This is\
    \ an alternative to chemical nematocides, which in recent years have given way\
    \ to the ecological methods.<br>\nRecently the interest both in recycling organic\
    \ waste composting technology, including a vermicomposting and more widespread\
    \ use of such products in practice continuously increases. The application of\
    \ compost in vegetable cultivation has a positive effect on growth, yield and\
    \ plant health status. This is due to the high microbiological activity, which\
    \ depletes the available nutrients for the survival and reproduction of the pathogen.<br>\n\
    Development of varieties with complex resistance to economically important diseases\
    \ and pests is of great importance for limiting of the pesticide use and for obtaining\
    \ of healthier vegetable production as part of the diet of people. This is an\
    \ ecological alternative method to control soil pests.<br>\nGrafting is an appropriate\
    \ method that could also be integrated in the system for soil pest control. However\
    \ the grafted culture could be tolerant to a range of pathogens and nematodes,\
    \ but sensitive to other.<br>\nThe same effect could be observed in any kind of\
    \ organic products improving the soil, including compost, green manure and organic\
    \ mulch. The organic enhancers may both increase the tolerance of the host-plant\
    \ and reduce the population of nematodes. It was established that some field crops\
    \ and cover crops (cereals and legumes) are non-host crops for nematodes. Many\
    \ Brassica species manifest nematocidic activity against various plant-parasitic\
    \ nematodes, including Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, Heterodera schachtii\
    \ and Pratylenchus neglectus.<br>\nSearching and establishment of alternative\
    \ methods to control soil pests by optimally combined use of bioresources will\
    \ give a possibility for production of quality and healthy greenhouse vegetable\
    \ produce."
