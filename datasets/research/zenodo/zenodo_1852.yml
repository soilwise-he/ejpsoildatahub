  title: Functionalised graphite felt anodes for enhanced power generation in membrane-less
    soil microbial fuel cells
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;There is a global need for sustainable and clean technologies
    that can actively contribute to reach the net-zero carbon goal by 2050. Soil microbial
    fuel cell (SMFC) technology has a huge potential as affordable and green energy
    harvesting source and as a carbon-neutral bioremediation strategy for the treatment
    of pollutant lands. In this work, for the first time the use of cobalt oxide modified
    graphite felt (GF) electrodes is explored as the anode material in SMFCs, with
    the aim of promoting the development of a high-performing electroactive biofilm
    and, therefore, boosting the electrocatalytic processes. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4)
    nanoflowers, obtained by calcinating cobalt hydroxide salt hydrothermally deposited
    onto graphite felt, decreased the hydrophobicity, the&lt;br&gt;

    conductivity and consequently the electrochemical activity of carbon-based electrodes.&lt;br&gt;

    Physiochemical characterisation studies revealed that the cobalt nanostructures
    were uniformly deposited and anchored onto the GF electrode. Nonetheless, when
    Co3O4-GF anodes were tested in a membrane-less, air-cathode SMFC device, after
    an initial boost in power performance, the activity decayed with time, probably
    due to Co3O4 leaching. Interweaving of Co3O4 functionalised&lt;br&gt;

    GF electrodes with polyaniline (PANI) (PANI-Co3O4-GF anode), led to a highly performing
    SMFC system that generated a peak power density of 70 mW m-2, corresponding to
    a current density of 143 mA m-2. This value of power density was nearly three
    times greater than the power generated by the same SMFC system but with a plain
    GF anode. The interweaving of PANI onto the Co3O4-GF electrode led to a porous
    structure that, while favouring microbial attachment, provides stability to the
    electrode over prolonged periods of operation. Overall, these results provide
    exciting perspectives on the development of composite carbon-based anode materials
    for highly performing soil microbial fuel cells, thus inspiring future trends
    in the field.&lt;/p&gt;'
