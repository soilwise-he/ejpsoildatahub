  title: Malting Sludges as Soil Amendment
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>Residual\
    \ sludge that results from the treatment of malt house effluents produced during\
    \ the malting of barley in malt house (Argentina) was evaluated to determine its\
    \ fertilising potential and capability for improving soil as a way to reuse or\
    \ recycle this material. The Cabildo soil (Southwest of Buenos Aires Province),\
    \ of the typic Argiustoll subgroup had a sandy clay-loam texture and was tested\
    \ in this field experiments. This soil plots (4 m<sup>2</sup>) were amended with\
    \ equivalent malting sludges doses of 5, 15, and 25 Mg/ha. When biosolids, like\
    \ malting sludges, are incorporated as an amendment, many micronutrients are provided.\
    \ Chemical properties of the soil, particularly the pH, EC (Electrical Conductivity)\
    \ and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), were improved. Dactylis glomerata L. were\
    \ utilised as growing crop (forage) in this field test, productivity ( Dry matter)\
    \ and quality (protein %) gave results following 0,205 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>and 11.94\
    \ % at control in comparison with 0,4 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>and 15.15 % of amended\
    \ soil. Calcium concentration in grasses was significantly different for control\
    \ (4651 mg/kg<sup>-1</sup>) in comparison with high sludge dose (8907 mg/kg<sup>-1</sup>),\
    \ the same trend was found with micronutrients like Copper and Molybdenum. This\
    \ result from field test indicate that this residual sludge constitutes a suitable\
    \ amendment for agricultural soils, increasing quality and productivity of Dactylis\
    \ glomerata L and improving several soil properties.</em>"
