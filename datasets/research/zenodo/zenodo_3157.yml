  title: INFLUENCE OF STRUCTURING AGENT AND HERBICIDE ON SOIL HUMIDITY AND STATE OF
    WEEDS ON THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SLOPES OF THE CHATKAL RIDGE IN UZBEKISTAN
  abstract: '<em>This article describes the effect of soil structure formers and herbicide
    on soil moisture and on the state of weeds when creating forest plantations on
    different mountain slopes of the Chatkal Range.</em> <em>From the experiments,
    it was found that the structurizers used in the experiment of 2 types of structure-forming
    agents in the hottest summer period (July-August), when there was a complete absence
    of precipitation, contributed to an increase in soil moisture in the root layer
    of plants </em> <em>2-4% higher than the wilting moisture, which was observed
    in the control variant.</em> <em>In 2017, during the same period, the coverage
    of the terrace canvas with herbage was: treated with polyameliorant 46.6%, treated
    with CMC - 51.6%, and not treated (in control) - 59.3%.</em>'
