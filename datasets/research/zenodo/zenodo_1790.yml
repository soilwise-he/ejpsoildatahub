  title: 'RELIEF AND SOIL COVER OF THE NORTHERN BLACK SEA REGION: ECOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL
    ASPECT'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The possibilities of mutual dependence of the areas of genetic
    types and varieties of the soil cover of the intensively developed region of the
    Northern Black Sea Coast with taxonomy of geomorphologic zoning, with morphogenetic
    categories of the relief of the earth&#39;s surface, with separate topographical
    and genetically homogeneous surfaces, with simple and complex surfaces of different
    morphology, exposition, morphometric parameters (vertical and horizontal dismemberment,
    steepness of the slopes) are considered and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The relevance of this approach is important and timely, given the presence
    of a number of problems in the Ukrainian economy. The study is carried out both
    in the territory of the regions a whole and in key areas, which in general represent
    the most revealing features of orographic, geomorphologic and paleogeographic
    character, distribution and quality of soil cover.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the analysis of the theoretical and methodological representations,
    an algorithm for the ecological and geomorphological analysis of the formation
    is used and degradation of the soil cover in the central part of the Northern
    Black Sea Coast is developed, based on the provisions of the philosophical vision
    of scientific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;This report presents a step-by-step consideration, based on the example
    of the investigated territory, the diverse cartographic information chosen and
    analyzed in the context of the message topic, in conjunction with the properties
    of the soil cover of the region&lt;/p&gt;'
