  title: "Study Of Soil Contaminated With Arsenic, Cadmium And Lead In Ancient Tailings\
    \ In Zacatecas, M\xE9xico"
  abstract: "Due to the growth of the urban area towards lands\ncontaminated with\
    \ ancient tails, in this work we evaluated if the\nleaching with calcium thiosulfate\
    \ (CaS2O3) for the recovery of silver,\ngold and mercury from this soil, also\
    \ dissolves arsenic, cadmium and\nlead; for this, we determined their quantity\
    \ per each fraction of size\nof particle of the soil before and after the dissolution.\
    \ Half of the soil\nsamples were leached in the plant Beneficiadora de Jales del\
    \ Centro,\nS. A. de C.V. and the rest of them remained in the laboratory. The\n\
    ICP-OES technique was used to determine the amounts of arsenic,\ncadmium and lead,\
    \ in the samples of both lots. The soil samples were\ncollected in a neighboring\
    \ area at El Lampotal, Vetagrande,\nZacatecas, M\xE9xico, with an extension of\
    \ 600 m2 at 22\xBA52' 37.69'' N,\n102\xBA25' 11.73'' W. The amount of arsenic,\
    \ cadmium and lead found\nin nonleached soil and for a particle size of 47 \u03BC\
    m was 203.72\xB13.73,\n33.63\xB11.31 and 3480.99\xB120.4 mg/kg respectively."
