  title: Simplified equivalent soil profiles based on liquefaction performance for
    shallow-founded structures
  abstract: 'Earthquake-induced liquefaction is responsible for considerable structural
    damage. However, conventional liquefaction assessment focuses only on triggering.
    In this paper, the eval-uation of liquefaction is refocused to consider the performance
    of buildings. A new hazard-inde-pendent liquefaction classification is proposed
    where the soil profile is defined as an equivalent 3-layered soil profile. The
    classification consists of only three features, highly influential to the performance
    of buildings: the depth of the non-liquefying crust, and the thickness and liquefaction
    resistance of the potentially liquefiable layer. The influence of these parameters
    is explored with reference to changes of the ground surface acceleration and foundation
    bearing capacity. A pro-cedure to obtain the 3-layered soil profile from CPT data
    is developed and set of soil profile classes are developed for rapid loss assessment
    purposes. The procedure and classes are demon-strated on a case study site considering
    100 CPT from Christchurch and a comparison is made regarding the computed LSN
    value for the equivalent and CPT profiles.'
