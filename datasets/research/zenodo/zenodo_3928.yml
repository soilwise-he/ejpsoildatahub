  title: Study of Soil Vulnerability to Water Erosion in the Kissane Watershed by
    the Improved Bouyoucos Method
  abstract: "Abstract Water erosion is one of the major environmental and agricultural\
    \ problems affecting the Thi\xE8s plateau and more particularly the village of\
    \ Kissane. The study of this phenomenon requires the understanding and characterization\
    \ of the textural and structural components of the soil. Knowing that the relative\
    \ combination of sand, silt and clay in a soil is considered to have an impact\
    \ on erosion resistance, this present study relates the composition of the soil\
    \ to a risk assessment index erosion \"EIROM\". Thus, the objectives set are first\
    \ of all to determine the erosion risk assessment index, then to classify the\
    \ degree of soil erodibility and finally to produce a vulnerability map of the\
    \ soil erosion risks in Kissane watershed. To do this, a field campaign was carried\
    \ to take soils samples from different horizons followed by treatment in the laboratory.\n\
    \nBqsed on the Bouyoucos index results, we calculated the EIROM risk assessment\
    \ index for each soil sample taken in the study area. After a classification of\
    \ the degree of erodibility according to the 'ROM' scale, we identified three\
    \ (3) classes of vulnerability to water erosion: low risk areas (53.4%), moderate\
    \ risk areas (44.9%) and very high risk areas (1.7%). These results made it possible\
    \ to draw up an erosion risk assessment map to guide the various possible soil\
    \ conservation intervention actions."
