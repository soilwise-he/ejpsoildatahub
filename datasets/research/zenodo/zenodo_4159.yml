  title: Potency of Na-Humate from Subbituminous and how to do Incubation with Fosfor-Fertilizer
    to Increase Upland Rice Production at Acidic Mineral Soil
  abstract: 'This research was purposed to study the ability of Na-humate from subbituminous
    combined with P-fertilizer and the way of incubation to control metals Al, soil
    fertility improvement and productivity of acidic minerals soil (Ultisol), so that
    the use of fertilizer could be saved and the optimal production of upland rice
    can be achieved. The experiment was designed using a 3 x 4 factorial with 3 replications
    in randomly groups design. The 1st factor was 3 ways of incubating Na-humate with
    P-fertilizer which are : I1 = Incubation of Na-humate 1 week, then incubation
    P-fertilizer 1 week; I2 = Incubation of Na-humate and P fertilizer directly into
    the soil for 2 weeks; and I3 = Na-humate and P fertilizer mixed for 1 week, then
    incubation to the soil for 1 week. The 2nd factor was Na-humate and P-fertilizer
    combination which are 4 doses H1 = 400 ppm (0.8 Mg/ha) + 100% R; H2 = 400 ppm
    + 75% R; H3 = 800 ppm (1.6 Mg/ha) + 100% R,; and H4 = 800 ppm + 75% R. The results
    showed that the best treatment interaction was founded to be 800 ppm Na-humate
    and 100% R P-fertilizer doses in I3 way incubation that is equal to 5.58 Mg/ha
    rice yield. However, this result is almost the same as 800 ppm Na-humate + 75%
    R P-fertilizer doses followed in I3 way incubation too. It was concluded that
    addition of Na-humate could save P-fertilizer up to 25%.'
