  title: Grassland contribution to soil organic carbon stock under climate change
    scenarios in Basque Country (Spain)
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;In&nbsp;this study, we estimated the contribution of managed grasslands
    to the &ldquo;4 per 1000&rdquo; initiative&nbsp;in&nbsp;Basque Country under two
    climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) adopted by the IPCC&nbsp;in&nbsp;its Fifth
    Assessment Report. For this purpose, the RothC model was calibrated and validated
    with a historic database of grassland soil organic carbon (SOC) (1983 to 2019).
    The results at field-scale show a rate of increase of 1.26 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;year&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;at
    a depth of 0&ndash;30&nbsp;cm over a 36-year simulation. The model was run at
    the regional scale&nbsp;in&nbsp;short- (2020&ndash;2040), medium- (2041&ndash;2070),
    and long-term (2071&ndash;2090) future climate scenarios. For all the simulations,
    agricultural practices and available data for grassland systems were considered.
    RothC model projections showed how SOC stock responses varied depending on initial
    SOC and climate subregions, with higher values for a lower initial SOC stock under
    the highest precipitation regime subregion. A 4 per 1000 storage rate could be
    achieved&nbsp;in&nbsp;grassland soils with an initial SOC &lt; 80 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
    The overall trends showed that future climate change will lead to a decrease&nbsp;in&nbsp;the
    SOC stock&nbsp;in&nbsp;grasslands with a higher initial SOC if appropriate practices
    are not implemented to maintain the SOC stock. &copy; 2022, The Author(s).&lt;/p&gt;'
