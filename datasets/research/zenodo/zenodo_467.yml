  title: WAYS TO PREVENT SOIL SALINIZATION AND INCREASE FERTILITY
  abstract: <em>In the article, the connection between different crusts of the earth's
    surface is realized through the soil. Soil is the basis of natural landscapes.
    Depending on its activity in the biosphere, soil can be considered the most important
    link in the chain of organic life. The land used for agricultural purposes on
    Earth is 10% of the available land area and corresponds to 0.5 hectares per capita
    of the world's population. The current state of the earth's soil layer is primarily
    determined by the activities of human society. Man has positive and negative effects
    on soil. Man can increase the productivity of the soil and improve the condition
    of the land.</em>
