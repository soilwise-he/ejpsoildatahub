  title: Classification of archaeological pieces into their respective stratum by
    a chemometric model based on the soil concentration of 25 selected elements
  abstract: 'The aim of this work was to demonstrate that an archaeological ceramic
    piece has remained buried underground in the same stratum for centuries without
    being removed. For this purpose, a chemometric model based on Principal Component
    Analysis, Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis classification techniques was created with the concentration of some
    selected elements of both soil of the stratum and soil adhered to the ceramic
    piece. Some ceramic pieces from four different stratigraphic units, coming from
    a roman archaeological site in Alava (North of Spain), and its respective stratum
    soils were collected. The soil adhered to the ceramic pieces was removed and treated
    in the same way as the soil from its respective stratum. The digestion was carried
    out following the US Environmental Pollution Agency EPA 3051A method. A total
    of 54 elements were determined in the extracts by a rapid screening inductively
    coupled plasma mass spectrometry method. After rejecting the major elements and
    those which could have changed from the original composition of the soils (migration
    or retention from/to the buried objects), the following elements (25) were finally
    taken into account to construct the model: Li, V, Co, As, Y, Nb, Sn, Ba, La, Ce,
    Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Au, Th and U. A total of 33 subsamples
    were treated from 10 soils belonging to 4 different stratigraphic units. The final
    model groups and discriminate them in four groups, according to the stratigraphic
    unit, having both the stratum and soils adhered to the pieces falling down in
    the same group.'
