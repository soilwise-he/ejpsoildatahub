  title: Pasture and soil zinc evolution in forest and agriculture soils of Northwest
    Spain three years after fertilisation with sewage sludge
  abstract: The main problem with the agricultural use of sewage sludge is the higher
    heavy metal (mainly zinc) concentrations in the sludge than in the soil. In Spain,
    R.D. 1310/1990 and European Directive 86/278 limit the total heavy metal concentration
    in soil but not the changes in heavy metal availability, which directly affect
    plant absorption and thereby represent a possible risk to human health. The heavy
    metal availability in soil depends on different factors (pH, soil organic matter,
    and weather) and the type of soil (agriculture or forest). This study evaluate
    the effects of two types of soils (forest and agriculture), two types of vegetation
    (natural and sown), and two types of fertilisation (sludge fertilisation and mineral
    fertilisation, with a no fertiliser control) in afforested and treeless pastures
    and in sown and unsown forestlands of Northwest Spain on the total and available
    Zn concentration in soil and the concentration of Zn in grasslands. The experimental
    design was completely randomised with nine treatments and three replicates. The
    fertilisation with sewage sludge increased the total, Mehlich 3 and sward Zn concentrations
    in forest and agriculture soils, and the levels of Zn were lower in the forest
    than in the agriculture soils probably because of the low soil pH in the former
    which probably limited the mineralisation of the sludge in the forest soil. Therefore,
    there is still a potential source of Zn in forest soils than in agriculture soils,
    when the incorporation conditions improve. This makes advisable to extend the
    period without grazing after sewage sludge inputs in forest than agriculture soils
    to avoid direct Zn intake by animals through the soil consumption. The effect
    of the application of sewage sludge on sward Zn concentrations was more relevant
    in unsown pastures of forest soils than in agriculture soils due to the different
    absorption capacity of unsown compared with sown species. Zinc inputs from sewage
    sludge to soils did not cause harmful effects on plants or animals. However, the
    management of heavy metal availability must be included by policy makers in further
    directives to better evaluate environmental risk. Moreover, Zn maintenance requirements
    of animals like goats, horses, bovines and ovine were not often reached, which
    may make advisable to provide Zn supplement to animals if their nourishment is
    derived solely from these pastures.
