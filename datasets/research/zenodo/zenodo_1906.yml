  title: 'Copper in soil fractions and runoff in a vineyard catchment: Insights from
    copper stable isotopes'
  abstract: "Understanding the fate of copper (Cu) fungicides in vineyard soils and\
    \ catchments is a prerequisite to limit the off-site impact of Cu. Using Cu stable\
    \ isotopes, Cu retention in soils and runoff transport was investigated in relation\
    \ to the use of Cu fungicides and the hydrological conditions in a vineyard catchment\
    \ (Rouffach, Haut-Rhin, France; mean slope: 15%). The \u03B465Cu values of the\
    \ bulk vineyard soil varied moderately through the depth of the soil profiles\
    \ (\u2212 0.12 to 0.24\u2030 \xB1 0.08\u2030). The values were in the range of\
    \ those of the fungicides (\u2212 0.21 to 0.11\u2030) and included the geogenic\
    \ \u03B465Cu value of the untreated soil (0.08\u2030). However, \u03B465Cu values\
    \ significantly differed between particle-size soil fractions (\u2212 0.37 \xB1\
    \ 0.10\u2030 in fine clays and 0.23 \xB1 0.07\u2030 in silt). Together with the\
    \ soil mineralogy, the results suggested Cu isotope fractionation primarily associated\
    \ with the clay and fine clay fractions that include both SOM and mineral phases.\
    \ The vegetation did not affect the Cu isotope patterns in the vineyard soils.\
    \ Cu export by runoff from the catchment accounted for 1% of the applied Cu mass\
    \ from 11th May to 20th July 2011, covering most of the Cu use period. 84% of\
    \ the exported Cu mass was Cu bound to suspended particulate matter (SPM). The\
    \ runoff displayed \u03B465Cu values from 0.52 to 1.35\u2030 in the dissolved\
    \ phase ("
