  title: Effect of Long-Term Farming Practices on Agricultural Soil Microbiome Members
    Represented by Metagenomically Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and Their Predicted Plant-Beneficial
    Genes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Abstract: To follow the hypothesis that agricultural management
    practices affect structure and function of the soil microbiome regarding soil
    health and plant-beneficial traits, high-throughput (HT) metagenome analyses were
    performed on Chernozem soil samples from a long-term field experiment designated
    LTE-1 carried out at Bernburg-Strenzfeld (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). Metagenomic
    DNA was extracted from soil samples representing the following treatments: (i)
    plough tillage with standard nitrogen fertilization and use of fungicides and
    growth regulators, (ii) plough tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization (50%),
    (iii) cultivator tillage with standard nitrogen fertilization and use of fungicides
    and growth regulators, and (iv) cultivator tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization
    (50%). Bulk soil (BS), as well as root-affected soil (RS), were considered for
    all treatments in replicates. HT-sequencing of metagenomic DNA yielded approx.
    100 Giga bases (Gb) of sequence information. Taxonomic profiling of soil communities
    revealed the presence of 70 phyla, whereby Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
    Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and
    Chloroflexi feature abundances of more than 1%. Functional microbiome profiling
    uncovered, i.a., numerous potential plant-beneficial, plant-growth-promoting and
    biocontrol traits predicted to be involved in nutrient provision, phytohormone
    synthesis, antagonism against pathogens and signal molecule synthesis relevant
    in microbe&ndash;plant interaction. Neither taxonomic nor functional microbiome
    profiling based on single-read analyses revealed pronounced differences regarding
    the farming practices applied. Soil metagenome sequences were assembled and taxonomically
    binned. The ten most reliable and abundant Metagenomically Assembled Genomes (MAGs)
    were taxonomically classified and metabolically reconstructed. Importance of the
    phylum Thaumarchaeota for the analyzed microbiome is corroborated by the fact
    that the four corresponding MAGs were predicted to oxidize ammonia (nitrification),
    thus contributing to the cycling of nitrogen, and in addition are most probably
    able to fix carbon dioxide. Moreover, Thaumarchaeota and several bacterial MAGs
    also possess genes with predicted functions in plant&ndash;growth&ndash;promotion.
    Abundances&nbsp;of certain MAGs (species resolution level) responded to the tillage
    practice, whereas the factors compartment (BS vs. RS) and nitrogen fertilization
    only marginally shaped MAG abundance profiles. Hence, soil management regimes
    promoting plant-beneficial microbiome members are very likely advantageous for
    the respective agrosystem, its health and carbon sequestration and accordingly
    may enhance plant productivity. Since Chernozem soils are highly fertile, corresponding
    microbiome data represent a valuable reference resource for agronomy in general.&lt;/p&gt;'
