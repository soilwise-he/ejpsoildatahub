  title: Pedotransfer Function for Predicting Orchard Organic Carbon Soil in Haugiang
    Province, Vietnam
  abstract: <strong>The soil organic carbon content played an important role in soil
    fertility, then fruit yield and quality. The prediction of soil organic carbon
    in the fields at wider regions requires a large number of samples that are costly
    to analyze. The objective of this study was to apply pedotransfer function to
    quantify soil colour concerning soil organic carbon from 82 soil samples. A case
    study in Haugiang province, Vietnam. The results showed that there has a complicated
    relation to soil properties. Soil colour has the same Munsell Hue, but there is
    different between Munsell Value and Chroma when the soil has at the same humidity.
    Organic Carbon content ranged from 1,32 to 5,6%. There was negative significant
    correlation between organic C content and Munsell soil color, such as with Munsell
    Value (r = -0,75<sup>**</sup> air-dry, r = -0,74<sup>**</sup> moist); Munsell
    Chroma (r= -0,55<sup>** </sup>air-dry, r = -0,66<sup>**</sup> moist). Since, Visual
    soil colour assessment is useful predictors of organic C content, especially for
    topsoil. This study indicates that soil organic content can be predicted by using
    Munsell soil colours for visual field measurements on the old raised bed soils
    at the moist condition, which can be used for field soil fertility degradation
    recommendation. However, more study of pedotransfer function on other soils condition
    must be </strong><strong>correlated for further recommendation.</strong>
