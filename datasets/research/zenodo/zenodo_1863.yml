  title: Soil erosion rates based on anatomical changes in exposed roots - case study
    from southwest Bulgaria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In recent years different methods for soil erosion assessment
    have been used. Because of its high accuracy in estimations, dendrogeomorphology
    was selected as one suitable and reliable scientific method to achieve the main
    goals of this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the study is to date
    denudation events using anatomical responses of the tree-rings of the roots. We
    analyze the histological changes that occur in the roots of two tree species,
    along the river banks of the Sedelska River, which is a tributary of Struma River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
    significant differences between homogenous groups of measurements in pre-exposed
    and exposed roots was established, and it shows a remarkable response of roots
    to sheet erosion.&lt;/p&gt;'
