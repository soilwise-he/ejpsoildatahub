  title: HEAVY METALS IN DRY BOTTOM SOIL OF THE ARAL SEA AND THEIR MIGRATION
  abstract: Every year, up to one hundred million tons of toxic salt and dust mixture
    is carried by the winds from the dried bottom of the Aral Sea. Most of it settles
    in the nearest territories, but millions of tons are carried away thousands of
    kilometers away. The results of the analyzes show that the migration of toxicants
    infects the environment and pollutes plant products. Based on the results of the
    research, approaches have been developed to balance the ions in a layer of 0-20
    cm to create the development of plants according to biological properties.
