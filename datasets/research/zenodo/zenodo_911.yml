  title: IoT-Based Agro-Toolbox for Soil Analysis and Environmental Monitoring
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The agricultural sector faces numerous challenges in ensuring
    optimal soil health and environmental conditions for sustainable crop production.
    Traditional soil analysis methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive,
    and provide limited real-time data, making it challenging for farmers to make
    informed decisions. In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged
    as a promising solution to address these challenges by enabling efficient and
    automated soil analysis and environmental monitoring. This paper presents a 3D-printed
    IoT-based Agro-toolbox, designed for comprehensive soil analysis and environmental
    monitoring in the agricultural domain. The toolbox integrates various sensors
    for both soil and environmental measurements. By deploying this tool across fields,
    farmers can continuously monitor key soil parameters, including pH levels, moisture
    content, and temperature. Additionally, environmental factors such as ambient
    temperature, humidity, intensity of visible light, and barometric pressure can
    be monitored to assess the overall health of agricultural ecosystems. To evaluate
    the effectiveness of the Agro-toolbox, a case study was conducted in an aquaponics
    floating system with rocket, and benchmarking was performed using commercial tools
    that integrate sensors for soil temperature, moisture, and pH levels, as well
    as for air temperature, humidity, and intensity of visible light. The results
    showed that the Agro-toolbox had an acceptable error percentage, and it can be
    useful for agricultural applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
