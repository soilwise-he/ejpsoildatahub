  title: RESISTANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY INDICATORS OF GRAIN (BARLEY AND TRITICALE) CROPS
    WITH SPIKE TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN MODERATE SALINE SOIL - CLIMATIC
    CONDITIONS
  abstract: <em>This article is based on the data obtained from field experiments
    conducted in order to determine the abiotic and biotic factors resistance and
    yield elements of barley and triticale varieties planted in the field of spectral
    varieties of Sirdarya region. In the experiment conducted in field conditions,
    when the plants were harvested in the calculation area and biological yield was
    determined, triticale was 88.3 ts/ha, in the" Boyovut "variety - 83.1 ts/ha, in
    the" Tuyatish "variety - 67.6 ts/ha, in the" yielding "variety - 67.6 ts/ha, in
    the" Saykhun "variety - 69.0 ts/ha and in the" Sirdarya " variety - 65.8 ts /
    ha. It was observed that the indicators of resistance to external influences were
    high in barley varieties, and productivity elements in triticale varieties were
    higher in barley varieties due to the biological capabilities of the plant.</em>
