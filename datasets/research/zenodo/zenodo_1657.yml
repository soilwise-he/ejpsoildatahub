  title: EFFECT OF COMPOST AGAINST SOIL-BORNE PLANT PATHOGENS AND ITS IMPACT ON RHIZOSPHERE
    MICROBIOTA
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Compost microbiota and microbial activity play a key role in
    suppressing soil-borne plant pathogens, starting from rhizosphere, The objective
    of the present work was to summarize results achieved evaluating compost efficacy
    against soil-borne pathogens such as Phytophthora capsici on courgette and Fusarium
    oxysporum on lettuce and tomato, and explain possible relationships among the
    targeted host/pathogen and the rhizosphere microbiota due to compost applications.
    Experimental trials were carried out on potted plants (by mixing compost into
    the potting substrate) and in two infested fields (by transplanting plants previously
    grown using potting substrate containing compost). Quantitative Polymerase Chain
    Reaction - qPCR and the next generation amplicon sequencing technologies were
    applied on rhizosphere samples. Compost suppressed the diseases by 50-70%, compared
    to the untreated controls. Moreover, a reduction of the abundance of the soil-borne
    pathogens up to 100 folds was observed in the soils where compost was applied.
    The abundance of beneficial microorganisms, such as Bacillus and Trichoderma,
    was also influenced and a 10-100 folds increase of it was observed in the rhizosphere
    of plants treated with compost. However, compost application did not affect the
    microbial diversity observed applying next generation amplicon sequencing. These
    findings suggest that compost can be used to reduce plant diseases caused by soil-borne
    pathogens, most probably improving the abundance of beneficial microorganisms
    and reducing that of pathogens, but not increasing rhizosphere microbial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;'
