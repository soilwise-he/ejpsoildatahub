  title: TO EXPLORE ANTIMICROBIAL AND METAL MEDIATION PROPERTIES OF RHAMNOLIPID EXTRACTED
    FROM PSEUDOMONAS SPP. FROM METAL CONTAMINATED SOIL
  abstract: The heavy metal contamination and disposal of waste frying oil, as well
    as resistance, occurs due to the hydrophobic nature of antibiotics is a universal
    issue. The challenge is to develop a method in which biological molecules produced
    by the low-cost substrate used to reduce metal-associated toxicity in metal-contaminated
    waste. Along with that, such biological molecules can use alone or synergistically
    to makes the microbial cell surface more susceptible to accumulate hydrophobic
    substance (antibiotic) into the cell for restoring resistance. For this purpose,
    biosurfactant producing bacteria were isolated from a metal-contaminated soil
    sample and identified as Pseudomonas spp..The result showed that extracellular
    glycolipid produced by metal isolate was Rhamnolipid. Maximum rhamnolipid production
    observed when the culture was incubated for 6-8 days in medium containing different
    amount of mannitol and peptone. Fried oil also acts as the best carbon source
    giving excellent rhamnolipid production. Moreover, extracted rhamnolipid found
    to be antimicrobial against gram-positive, gram-negative organisms and fungi as
    well. It also increases its microbicidal activity of ampicillin antibiotic when
    used synergistically with rhamnolipid. Different concentrations (60, 80?g/ml)
    of rhamnolipid were evaluated and compared for the efficiency of heavy metal [Cr
    (VI)] removal. The result showed that superior adsorbent having 80 ?g/ml concentration
    of rhamnolipid reduced 46%, 39%, 32%, 19% of 10ppm, 20ppm, 60ppm, 80ppm of hexavalent
    chromium respectively.
