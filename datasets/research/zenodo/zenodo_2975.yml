  title: The Role Of Edta On Heavy Metals Phytoextraction By Jatropha Gossypifolia
    Grown On Soil Collected From Dumpsites In Ekiti State Nigeria
  abstract: Jatropha gossypifolia has been known to thrive well in tropical climate,
    most importantly in Nigeria where they are found to grow naturally on dumpsites.
    The potential use of this robust tropical plant in phytoremediation technology
    should be advocated especially for developing countries. This study investigates
    the effect of enhanced phytoextraction on the accumulation of the following heavy
    metals; (Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co and Sn) by J. gossypifolia cultivated
    on soil collected from dumpsites in Ekiti state, South Western Nigeria, with application
    of 1g/kg EDTA (Experiment) and without (control). Application of 1g/kg EDTA did
    not adversely affect plant growth, except at preflowering stage where were yellowing
    of leaves. The concentration of heavy metals in tissues of plant were higher in
    the experiment than control, with concentration of Pb (376.0, 350.0, 355.2 and
    328 mg/kg; experiment, 184.0, 180.0, 169.0 and 159.0 mg/kg; control), Cu ( 962.0,
    958.0, 898.0 and 818.0; experiment, 650.0, 526.0 464.2 and442.0 mg/kg; control)
    and Cd (416.8, 418.2, 399.0 and 377.5; experiment, 167.3, 164.2, 147.8 and 142.2
    mg/kg) at Aba Egbira, Atikankan, Igbehin and Moshood street dumpsites respectively
    in the shoot of the plant. Highest concentrations of heavy metals were obtained
    in leaves of the plant. Notably, concentration of Pb, Cu and Cd were greater than
    the threshold value of 100mg/kg, indicative of the fact that J. gossypifolia could
    be a good candidate for Pb, Cu and Cd-phytoextraction. Bioaccumulation factor
    (BF), translocation factor (TF) and remediation ratio (RR) values greater than
    one also revealed the effectiveness of the plant to translocate Pb, Cu and Cd
    to their harvestable portion and phytoextraction efficiency under the chelant-assisted
    phytoremediation. However, the concentration of heavy metals did not vary significantly
    at p&lt;0.05, least significant difference (LSD test) in all dumpsites investigated.
    Therefore, the use of J. gossypifolia is advocated as a candidate plant for restoring
    dumpsites polluted with heavy metals.
