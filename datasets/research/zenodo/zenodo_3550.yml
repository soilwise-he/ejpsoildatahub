  title: Mapping Soil Fertility At Different Scales To Support Sustainable Brazilian
    Agriculture
  abstract: 'Most agricultural crops cultivated in Brazil are highly

    nutrient demanding. Brazilian soils are generally acidic with low base

    saturation and available nutrients. Demand for fertilizer application

    has increased because the national agricultural sector expansion. To

    improve productivity without environmental impact, there is the need

    for the utilization of novel procedures and techniques to optimize

    fertilizer application. This includes the digital soil mapping and GIS

    application applied to mapping in different scales. This paper is

    based on research, realized during 2005 to 2010 by Brazilian

    Corporation for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) and its partners.

    The purpose was to map soil fertility in national and regional scales.

    A soil profile data set in national scale (1:5,000,000) was constructed

    from the soil archives of Embrapa Soils, Rio de Janeiro and in the

    regional scale (1:250,000) from COMIGO Cooperative soil data set,

    Rio Verde, Brazil. The mapping was doing using ArcGIS 9.1 tools

    from ESRI.'
