  title: National contribution of Slovakia to the global soil organic carbon sequestration
    potential map
  abstract: 'Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important component of soil which affects
    its properties and also is an important part of global carbon cycle. SOC was recognized
    as indicator of sustainable development in the frame of the UN Agenda 2030. In
    2020 the first global topsoil SOC sequestration map has been established by the
    Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS), the Global Soil Partnership
    (GSP), and the United Nations'' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) from national
    contributions of its members. Contribution of Slovakia represents the implementation
    of selected national spatial data in terms of the methodology created by the above-mentioned
    organizations. National sources of climate, soil (clay content, initial SOC),
    and partly also land use data were used as inputs for the RothC model to estimate
    SOC sequestration potential in agricultural soils. According to the obtained results,
    the topsoil (0,0-0,3 m) annual sequestration potential of SOC in agricultural
    soils of Slovakia is in range from 0.01 to 0.14 Mt C yr-1, depending on theoretical
    scenarios of soil carbon inputs. The current version of the SOC sequestration
    potential map for Slovakia still has got some limitations, mainly coming from
    the national data used, the methods of their processing, and it needs to be continuously
    updated. Keywords: Global Soil Partnership, map of soil organic carbon sequestration,
    agricultural land, soil organic carbon modelling, RothC model, national soil inventory
