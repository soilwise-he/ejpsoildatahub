  title: Prediction Of Soil Liquefaction By Using  Ubc3D-Plm Model In Plaxis
  abstract: 'Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength <br>

    and stiffness of a soil is reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid <br>

    cyclic loading. Liquefaction and related phenomena have been <br>

    responsible for huge amounts of damage in historical earthquakes <br>

    around the world. <br>

    Modeling of soil behavior is the main step in soil liquefaction <br>

    prediction process. Nowadays, several constitutive models for sand <br>

    have been presented. Nevertheless, only some of them can satisfy this <br>

    mechanism. One of the most useful models in this term is <br>

    UBCSAND model. In this research, the capability of this model is <br>

    considered by using PLAXIS software. The real data of superstition <br>

    hills earthquake 1987 in the Imperial Valley was used. The results of <br>

    the simulation have shown resembling trend of the UBC3D-PLM <br>

    model.'
