  title: Influence of Modified Urea Materials At Different N Rates on Estimated Wetland
    Rice Soil Ammonium-N and Nitrate-N
  abstract: This article 'Influence of Modified Urea Materials At Different N Rates
    on Estimated Wetland Rice Soil Ammonium-N and Nitrate-N' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
