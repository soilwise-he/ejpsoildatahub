  title: COMPOSITION AND TURNOVER TIME OF ORGANIC MATTER IN SOIL FRACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT
    MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY
  abstract: "This is the pre-print version of the article \"COMPOSITION AND TURNOVER\
    \ TIME OF ORGANIC MATTER IN SOIL FRACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY\"\
    \ published as final paper in Geoderma Volume 349, 1 September 2019, Pages 88-96\
    \ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.042 <strong>Abstract</strong> The\
    \ composition and turnover time (TT) of organic matter in soil fractions with\
    \ different magnetic susceptibility were studied in a tropical primary forest\
    \ in Ghana. The starting hypothesis was that soil organic matter (SOM) composition\
    \ and properties depend on the magnetic susceptibility of the minerals SOM is\
    \ associated with. Soil samples from 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, and 30-50 cm depth intervals\
    \ were sieved to remove rock fragments (&gt; 2.0 mm) and then separated into two\
    \ size fractions (0.5- 2.0 mm and &lt;0.5 mm) that were processed by a High Gradient\
    \ Magnetic Separator (HGMS) to finally obtain four fractions with different size\
    \ and/or magnetic susceptibility. All fractions were analysed for their mineral\
    \ composition, 14C concentration, and spectroscopic properties of SOM (13C CPMAS\
    \ NMR). From a mineralogical point of view, the magnetic (MA) fractions essentially\
    \ differed from the nonmagnetic (NM) ones for a higher presence of oxides and\
    \ kaolinite, which per se is non-magnetic. In terms of chemical composition of\
    \ SOM, the MA fractions showed higher contribution of labile compounds than the\
    \ NM ones. At all depths, the 14C concentration revealed shortest TT of SOM in\
    \ the &lt;0.5 mm MA fraction and longest TT in the &lt;0.5 mm NM fraction, while\
    \ the 0.5-2.0 mm fractions showed intermediate and similar TT\u2019s. At depths\
    \ &lt;5 cm, the fine NM fraction was not significantly influenced by the carbon\
    \ fixed after the 1950\u2019s (\u201Cbomb carbon\u201D), having TT of almost 1000\
    \ years and suggesting that in this tropical soil some SOM can be stabilized also\
    \ in relatively superficial horizons. Our findings support the hypothesis that\
    \ minerals are driving factors of the fate of SOM. As a consequence, soil fractionation\
    \ based on magnetic susceptibility might be a meaningful procedure for having\
    \ insight into SOM dynamics."
