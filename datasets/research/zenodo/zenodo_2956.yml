  title: Effect of Phosphorus Fertilizer Application on Yields of Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)
    Varieties across Sites of Differing Soil Fertility in western Kenya
  abstract: "Phosphorus deficiency remains a key constraint to cowpea productivity\
    \ in Kenya. Continuous cultivation of smallholder farms confounded with inadequate\
    \ use of fertilizer and use of poor local cowpea (<em>Vigna unguiculata</em>)\
    \ seed varieties, has led to decreased cowpea yields in western Kenya. Earlier\
    \ studies have indicated that application of phosphorus fertilizer at recommended\
    \ rates as well as growing of improved cowpea varieties may result to increased\
    \ grain yield. Against this background, improved cowpea varieties were screened\
    \ under different phosphorus (Triple Super Phosphate) fertilizer rates to investigate\
    \ their response on grain yield production, at sites of differing soil fertility\
    \ status (Bonjoge and Koibem) in western Kenya. Field experiments were conducted\
    \ during the short rain (SR) seasons in 2019. The experiments were factorially\
    \ arranged and laid out in a RCBD with three replications at both sites. P was\
    \ applied at three levels of 0, 15, and 30 kg P/ha. Six cowpea varieties; one\
    \ local check (Khaki) and five improved varieties (ICV1, 1CV12, CB46, IT92K-282-2\
    \ and IT83D-442) were tested. Grain yield data collected was subjected to analysis\
    \ of variance using SAS statistical software, release 8.2. Least Significant Difference\
    \ test separated means of parameters whenever significant difference was detected\
    \ at \u2265 95% confidence level. Phosphorus application resulted to insignificant\
    \ (p&lt;0.05) increase in cowpea grain yield across varieties. Highest and least\
    \ average yields were from variety CB 46 (325 kg/ha) and variety Khaki (216 kg/ha)\
    \ and IT 90K-284-2 (216 kg/ha), respectively. At Bonjoge, cowpea grain yields\
    \ varied from 206 to 434 kg/ha and were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than\
    \ the yields at Koibem which ranged from 127 to 342 kg/ha. The results of this\
    \ study show that while cowpea productivity is influenced by soil fertility status,\
    \ application of P was not essential for grain yield production. Interaction of\
    \ fertilizer and varieties in Bonjoge resulted to a positive grain yield response,\
    \ hence suitable site for cowpea."
