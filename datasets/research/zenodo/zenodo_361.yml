  title: Stone Bunds For Soil and Water Conservation
  abstract: "Natural resources like soil and water are under serious threat due to\
    \ intensive agriculture which is intended to increase the world's food production.\
    \ But, sustainable food production for the future generation becomes challenging\
    \ due to soil and water quality deterioration. Soil erosion is one of the significant\
    \ problems which decreases soil health and crop production. Anthropogenic activities\
    \ coupled with climate change further worsen the condition. Rainfall/precipitation,\
    \ topography, vegetation and soil property are the major factors contributing\
    \ to soil erosion. The worldwide annual rate of soil erosion from agricultural\
    \ land ranges from 22 to 100-ton ha<sup>\u22121</sup>, which results in 15\u2013\
    30% loss of agricultural productivity."
