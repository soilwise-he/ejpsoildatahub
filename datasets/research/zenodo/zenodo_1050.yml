  title: Soil Heavy Metals Patterns In Torino Olympic Winter Games Venue (E.U.)
  abstract: "The city of Torino (45\xB0N, 7\xB0E NW Italy) has a long history of heavy\
    \ industry. Additional sources of potential pollutants originate from transport\
    \ such as car emissions. We selected an area potentially at high risk of contamination:\
    \ it is sandwiched between roads, the circular Turin highway and the motorway\
    \ which connects to France, and a landfill where special and hazardous solid wastes\
    \ from industry are disposed of. Our main aim was i) to discriminate between these\
    \ sources of heavy metals (HM) and ii) to assess a simplified HM transfer scenario.\
    \ We started with air diffusion models (inputs were meteo and chemistry of the\
    \ particulate), then we described topsoils (12 samples km-2) and we sampled, reallocated\
    \ undisturbed, and cultivated an Ap soil horizon, being the soil ceteris paribus.\
    \ The topsoils description discriminated Factor I, related to the vehicular load\
    \ and soil parent material (mainly Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, V, and Zn), and Factor II,\
    \ HM univocally dispersible from the landfill (Sb and As). The ecosystem response\
    \ is resilience: soil tends to buffer loadings of most HM. In the case of mercury,\
    \ lead, and arsenic our findings indicate that their transfer to the food chain\
    \ may be massive."
