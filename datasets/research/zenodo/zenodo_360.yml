  title: SOME ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF UDZUNGWA SCARP SOIL
  abstract: The Udzungwa scarp is prone to landslide, slope instability, and severe
    erosion brought about by several interrelated factors like rainfall, soil geological
    formation, geomorphological feature of the slope and gross engineering properties
    of the soil available within the scarp. In this paper, some engineering properties
    of soil available within the scarp are discussed. Various soil engineering characteristics,
    erosion, and slope stability problems are pinpointed and discussed. This paper
    is based on the study carried out during pre-construction, construction, and post-construction
    investigation of 16 Km of Kihansi Dam Access road, which is traversing the Udzungwa
    escarpment.
