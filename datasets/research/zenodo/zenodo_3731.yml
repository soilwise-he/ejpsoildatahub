  title: Features of Soil Formation in the North of Western Siberia in Cryogenic Conditions
  abstract: A large part of Russia is located in permafrost areas. These areas are
    widely used because there are concentrated valuable natural resources. Therefore
    to explore of cryosols it is important due to the significant increase of anthropogenic
    stress as well as the problem of global climate change. In the north of Western
    Siberia permafrost phenomena is widespread. Permafrost as a factor of soil formation
    and cryogenesis as a process have a great impact on the soil formation of these
    areas. Based on the research results of permafrost-affected soils tundra landscapes
    formed in the central part of the Tazovskiy Peninsula in cryogenic conditions,
    data were obtained which characterize the morphological features of soils. The
    specificity of soil cover distribution and manifestation of soil-forming processes
    within the study area are noted. Permafrost features such as frost cracking, cryoturbation,
    thixotropy, movement of humus are formed. The formation of these features is increased
    with the development of the territory. As a consequence, there is a change in
    the components of the environment and the destruction of the soil cover.
