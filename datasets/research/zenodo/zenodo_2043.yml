  title: 'Soil centipedes (Chilopoda, Geophilomorpha) in the Val Camonica forests
    (Southern Alps): species composition and richness'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil centipedes (Chilopoda, Geophilomorpha) are a widespread
    group of predators in the forest soils of the European Alps. While in the eastern
    and western parts of the Southern Prealps, larger efforts were devoted to sample
    and study the geophilomorph fauna, little is known about species richness and
    composition of geophilomorph communities in the central part of Southern Prealps.
    In this work, five sites located in the Val Camonica were surveyed by hand searching,
    between November 2021 and July 2022 and their species richness was estimated applying
    non-parametrical statistical methods (Chao-1 and Abundance-based Coverage Estimator)
    to account for incomplete detection. A total of 18 species were found amongst
    the five sites. A maximum of 12 species were recorded in each single site, while
    estimates suggest that another 1-3 species were likely undetected. Species composition
    were found highly variable also between sites with similar species richness.&lt;/p&gt;'
