  title: Effect of bush burning Intensity on selected soil physical and chemical properties
    in Ile-Ife, Nigeria
  abstract: "Bush burning for land clearing is prevalent among small-holder farmers\
    \ in Nigeria. Though an age-long practice, few empirical studies have documented\
    \ its impact on soil physical properties. This study investigated the effects\
    \ of controlled bush burning on selected soil physical and chemical properties\
    \ over two distinct cropping seasons. Three treatments consisting of two fire\
    \ intensities (burning at 200\xB0C and 400\xB0C) and a control with each treatment\
    \ replicated four times were arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design. The\
    \ temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer. Soil particle size was\
    \ not affected by burning at both fire intensities, while surface (0-15 cm) soil\
    \ bulk density decreased from 1.43 gcm<sup>-3</sup> to 1.095 gcm<sup>-3</sup>\
    \ after controlled burning. Soil water repellency was not affected by the treatment\
    \ while sorptivity decreased significantly but soil pH improved from 5.3 to 7.03\
    \ as fire intensity increased from 200\xB0C to 400\xB0C. Soil strength reduced\
    \ after burning from mean value of 7.05 kgm<sup>-2</sup> in control to 5.99 kgm<sup>-2</sup>\
    \ at 400\xB0C fire intensity. Microaggregate stability, soil organic carbon and\
    \ total nitrogen contents decreased while exchangeable bases and available phosphorus\
    \ contents increased as fire intensity increased from 200\xB0C to 400\xB0C. In\
    \ conclusion, within the period under consideration, fire intensity only improved\
    \ bulk density, soil strength, pH, and exchangeable bases."
