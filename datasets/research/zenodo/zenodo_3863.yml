  title: Distribution Patterns of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Marshy Soil
    and Sediments in Warri, Southern Nigeria
  abstract: 'This study was carried out to determine the seasonal distribution patterns
    of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marshy soil samples in Warri City,
    Southern Nigeria. The samples were collected during dry and rainy seasons from
    four locations within Warri and a control location in Agbarho, 20km away. Levels
    of 16 priority PAHs listed in United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
    were determined using Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization detector
    (GC-FID). This study was carried from January to March and June to August 2014,
    representing the dry and wet seasons respectively. Mean levels of individual PAHs
    for sediment samples in the dry season ranged from 0.001mg/kg low for Acenaphthene
    to 0.447mg/kg high for Benzo(a)pyrene while for soil samples in the dry season,
    mean levels ranged from 0.005mg/kg low for Acenaphtylene to 1.069mg/kg high for
    Benzo(a)pyrene. In the rainy season, individual PAH in sediments ranged from 0.001mg/kg
    low in acenaphthylene to 0.231mg/kg high for anthracene while for soil samples,
    mean levels of individual PAHs for rainy season ranged from 0.001mg/kg low in
    phenanthrene to 0.090mg/kg high for Benzo(b,k)Fluoranthene. Overall, the highest
    total concentration of individual PAH was recorded for benzo(a)pyrene with 3.302mg/kg
    in soil samples in the dry season while the lowest total concentration was Acenaphthylene
    with 0.012mg/kg in sediments in the rainy season. It was observed that PAHs concentration
    was generally higher in dry than rainy seasons for soil and sediment samples.
    This can be attributed to dissolution and washing-off of the PAHs during the rainy
    season.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V62017021194 AND DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18483/ijSci.1194'
