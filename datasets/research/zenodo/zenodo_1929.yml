  title: A Result Paper on Experimental Study on Stabilization of Soil Subgrade by
    Adding Stone Dust
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;There are various technique for improving strength and CBR value
    of soil. But by this method lot of investment require. So we improved the strength
    of soil by adding waste slurry of stone which contain lime. We find that when
    Kota Stone Dust is added in the soil then optimum moisture contains will be increased
    from 13.80 to 19.70 . Because in the Kota Stone Dust lime is available so lime
    absorb the water it moisture contain value increased. We also conclude that when
    Kota Stone Dust are added in the soil then maximum dry density will be decreased
    1.72 to 1.593 g cc. We also conclude that by adding Kota Stone Dust are added
    in the soil then UCS will also increased from 0.213MPa to 0.274Mpa but after more
    than 4 Kota stone Dust are added then strength will not increased. Deepak Kumar
