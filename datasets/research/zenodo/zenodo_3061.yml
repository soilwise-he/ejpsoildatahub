  title: Effects of dose and period of sewage sludge application on soil, tree and
    pasture components in a Pinus radiata D. Don silvopastoral system
  abstract: "The adequate use of sewage sludge in silvopastoral systems could enhance\
    \ positive \n elationships between pasture and trees to increase farm incomes\
    \ at medium, short and long term. The main aspects related to adequate sewage\
    \ sludge use as a fertiliser are dose and timing of application, once heavy metal\
    \ concentrations have been taken into account. This paper aims to evaluate the\
    \ date and dose of sewage sludge applications on soil (KCl pH,\nsoil organic matter),\
    \ pasture production and tree growth after the establishment of a \n ilvopastoral\
    \ system with Pinus radiata D. Don developed on sandy soils with an initial pH\
    \ of 5. It is concluded that the contribution of sewage sludge does not modify\
    \ the soil conditions in a consistent manner, but cause detectable edaphic improvements\
    \ depending on the climatic conditions, the results of which are manifested in\
    \ enhancement of pasture and trees. The application of high doses of sewage sludge\
    \ is the best option within those studied, as tree growth and pasture production\
    \ tend to be increased. There are no clear effects with regard to the date of\
    \ application, but if the desire is to increase pasture production during the\
    \ spring season, the sewage sludge will be applied in the first of the application\
    \ dates, whereas the greatest growth in the diameter of trees is produced in the\
    \ plots fertilised in February, although\nthe date of application does not appear\
    \ to have a clear effect on their growth in height."
