  title: CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL UNDER ULIN (Eusideroxylonzwageri)
    AND MERANTI (Shoreasp) TREE CROPS IN THE SEMPAJA ARBORETUM FOREST AT GENERAL TESTING
    CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INSTRUMENTS IN SAMARINDA
  abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine the chemical and textural characteristics\
    \ of the soil under Ulin (<em>Eusideroxylon zwageri</em>) and Meranti (<em>Shorea</em>\
    \ sp) stands in the Sempaja Arboretum Forest, Samarinda Center for Standard Testing\
    \ of Environmental Instruments. This research was carried out from March\u2013\
    May 2022 at the Sempaja Arboretum covering an area of 2.5 ha which is located\
    \ in the area of the Samarinda Center for Standard Testing of Environmental Instruments.\
    \ The research activities carried out included: literature study, field observation,\
    \ preparation, determination of sampling points, field sampling, soil analysis\
    \ in the laboratory, interpretation of soil analysis results and reporting. The\
    \ results showed that: (1) the chemical characteristics of the soil under ironwood\
    \ stands were: soil pH (very acid), organic-C content (very low), total-N content\
    \ (very low), available-P content (medium to high ), cation content of Ca<sup>++</sup>,\
    \ K<sup>+</sup>and Na<sup>+</sup>base cations (very low to low), cation Mg++ (low\
    \ to medium), CEC and saturation (low), texture class of silty loam soil; and\
    \ (2) chemical characteristics of the soil under meranti stands, namely: soil\
    \ pH (very acid), C-organic content (very low to low), content N-total (moderate),\
    \ available-P content (moderate to very high), cation content of Ca<sup>++</sup>,\
    \ K<sup>+</sup>and Na<sup>+</sup>basic cations (very low to low), cation of Mg++\
    \ (low to moderate), CEC (low), base saturation (very low to low), silty loam\
    \ soil texture class."
