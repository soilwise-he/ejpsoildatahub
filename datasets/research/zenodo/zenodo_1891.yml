    \ half-century technogenesis was \"pollution of the biosphere\", while accumulating\
    \ medium has become the soil. If the environmental assessment of the urban area\
    \ one of the most informative sites is studying the soil cover, accumulating dirt\
    \ that come over an extended period. The soil is the most sensitive indicator\
    \ of contamination in the landscape due to its material composition and physico-chemical\
    \ parameters.\n\nOn the territory of the Odessa region, there are 4 major seaports\
    \ of Ukraine, which are created and improved specialized complexes for processing\
    \ of iron-ore concentrate, fertilizer and sulfur.\n\nSamples of soil, which took\
    \ away from the areas of ports Yuzhny, Chernomorsk and Odessa, were analyzed for\
    \ metals and toxic elements.\n\nKeywords: soil pollution by port territory, toxic\
