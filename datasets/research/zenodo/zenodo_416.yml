  title: Effect of the Soil Amendments on the Physical and Chemical Properties of
    the Soil under Centre Pivot Irrigation System
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A field trial was conducted to evaluate the application of four
    soil amendments: sand, gypsum, cow manure and granular sulfur to improve the soil
    conditions under center pivot irrigation system to manage the mechanization of
    potato crop harvest in the autumn of 2012; the application of sand amendment was
    to facilitate mechanical harvest. Evaluation on the improvement of the soil properties
    were carried out during the growing season through monitoring the changes on soil
    texture and structure, saturation percentage, bulk density, soil pH and soil salinity.
    Clods formation occurred at all of the treatments at the harvest time an indication
    of negative structure improvement due to field trafficking for soil ridging, and
    spraying during the growing season. The clods samples contained higher %calcium
    carbonate and higher level of % (Silt+Clay) and less %sand than normal soil samples.
    Bulk density in the sand treatment was 1.41 gram/cm3 which was significantly higher
    than the other treatments which ranged 1.13 - 1.19 gram/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
    Saturation percentage increased at all of the treatments over the period of the
    experiment from 21 to 31 an indication of significant improvement on the soil
    water holding capacity. Salinity as measured by the soil Ec was significantly
    increased over the period of the experiment due to fertilizer application, and
    salinity at the cow manure treatment was higher than other treatments due to high
    salt level in the cow manure which reached an Ec average of 5.57 mS/cm over the
    period of the experiment. Chloride and bicarbonate levels were high and increased
    on all of the treatments at most sampling occasions of the trial, and sodium level
    was within the acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;
