  title: Effect of soil amendments on grain yield and incidence of rice leaffolder
    in iron-toxic soils of north Orissa, India
  abstract: This article 'Effect of soil amendments on grain yield and incidence of
    rice leaffolder in iron-toxic soils of north Orissa, India' appeared in the International
    Rice Research Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development
    of improved technology for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism
    to help scientists keep each other informed of current rice research findings.
    The concise scientific notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate
    with one another to obtain details on the research reported.
