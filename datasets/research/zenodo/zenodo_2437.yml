  title: Effectiveness of Difference Soil and Manure Mixture on Growth and Yield of
    Bak Choy Planted in Bags
  abstract: The study of soil groups, soil types, and soil characteristics is very
    important for the cultivation of crops in Cambodia. Selecting soil types that
    are not suitable for the type of crop will result in poor crop growth, slowness,
    and low yields. In the same way that the cultivation of crops in the production
    of vegetable crops is the same, that is, choosing the type of soil that is suitable
    for the crop is a point to consider and pay attention to. Due to some geographical
    areas in some communes, the topography is sandy or rocky, and the soil is hard,
    making it difficult for farmers to prepare parallel cultivable land where some
    people have less land and try to cultivate it using plastic buckets. Cement or
    bags to grow as a vegetable or grow to get some yield just to meet daily food
    needs; avoid spending money to buy vegetables from the market. Bak Choy is a crop
    that can grow on almost any type of soil, especially alluvial soils. It also has
    many benefits for the body, such as strengthening bones, the immune system, cancer
    cells, and so on. However, the cultivation of kale also encounters a number of
    problems, such as poor growth, low yields, pests, and diseases, especially the
    technique of choosing the wrong soil mixture, which affects the growth and yield.
    Not so good. A comparative study of different levels of soil and manure mixes
    on the growth and yield of Bak Choy in AmpilTapok commune, Orang Ov district,
    ThbongKhmum province. On the growth and yield of the first treatment (T1), the
    use of soil mix with cow dung, the second treatment (T2), the use of soil mix
    with chicken manure, and the third treatment (T3), the use of soil mix with pig
    manure is grown using a mixture of soil mixed with chicken manure (T2), which
    grows well and gives high yields in other ways.
