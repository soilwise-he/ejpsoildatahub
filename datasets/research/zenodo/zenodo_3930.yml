  title: Effect of Soil Nutrient Status on Carcass Quality of Pond-Raised Tilapia,
    Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The effect of nutrient status of soil on carcass quality of
    fish raised in earthen ponds was investigated between March and August 2016. Three
    soil profile pits were dug side by side three existing earthen ponds in three
    different geomorphological locations of Imo State at Umuagwo, Ulakwo and Uboma.
    Three homogenous soil horizons ( 0-20, 20-60, 60-150 cm) were identified and evaluated
    for nutrient composition by standard methods (USDA, 1971). Ten adults of O&lt;em&gt;reochromisniloticus&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;of
    average weight of 250.0&nbsp;+&nbsp;5.4g randomly selected from the associated
    earthen ponds were chemically evaluated for carcass composition in accordance
    with AOAC (2005). Soil textural class for the pond at Umuagwo was dominantly sandy,
    sandy loam at Ulakwo and clay loam at Uboma. Soil nutrient analysis showed that
    the sandy soil was grossly poor in total nitrogen (0.04 &ndash; 0.08) and soil
    exchangeable bases, K (0.01 -0.04%), Na (0.003-0.005%) as against the clay soil
    which had appreciably higher reserve of total nitrogen (0.21-0.32%), organic carbon
    (1.22-2.50%) and&nbsp; exchangeable bases, K (0.06-0.18%), and Na (0.020.09%).
    Nutrient composition of fish carcass from the clay pond in terms of two most important
    nutritive factors of crude protein&nbsp; (32.1&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.0%) and fat (6.36&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.1%)
    was significantly higher (P&lt; 0.05) than in the sandy pond (14.7+&nbsp;2.0%),
    4.4.&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;0.5%) and the sandy loam (14.9&nbsp;+&nbsp;25 %, 4.7&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.2
    %) respectively. The implication of this in site selection of earthen ponds is
    discussed.&lt;/p&gt;'
