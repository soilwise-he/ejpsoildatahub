  title: Evaluation of Steam and Soil Solarization for Meloidogyne arenaria Control
    in Florida Floriculture Crops
  abstract: "Steam and soil solarization were investigated for control of the root-knot\
    \ nematode Meloidogyne arenaria in 2 yr of field trials on a commercial flower\
    \ farm in Florida. The objective was to determine if preplant steam treatments\
    \ in combination with solarization, or solarization alone effectively controlled\
    \ nematodes compared to methyl bromide (MeBr). Trials were conducted in a field\
    \ with naturally occurring populations of M. arenaria. Treatments were solarization\
    \ alone, steam treatment after solarization using standard 7.6-cm-diameter perforated\
    \ plastic drain tile (steam 1), steam treatment following solarization using custom-drilled\
    \ plastic drain tile with 1.6-mm holes spaced every 3.8 cm (steam 2), and MeBr\
    \ applied at 392 kg/ha 80:20 MeBr:chloropicrin. Drain tiles were buried approximately\
    \ 35 cm deep with four tiles per 1.8 by 30 m plot. Steam application followed\
    \ a 4-wk solarization period concluding in mid-October. All steam was generated\
    \ using a Sioux propane boiler system. Plots were steamed for sufficient time\
    \ to reach the target temperature of 708C for 20 min. Solarization plastic was\
    \ retained on the plots during steaming and plots were covered with a single layer\
    \ of carpet padding to provide additional insulation. The floriculture crops larkspur\
    \ (Delphinium elatum and Delphinium X\_belladonna), snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus),\
    \ and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) were produced according to standard commercial\
    \ practices. One month after treatment in both years of the study, soil populations\
    \ of M. arenaria were lower in both steam treatments and in MeBr compared to solarization\
    \ alone. At the end of the season in both years, galling on larkspur, snapdragon,\
    \ and sunflowers was lower in both steam treatments than in solarization. Both\
    \ steam treatments also provided control of M. arenaria in soil at the end of\
    \ the season comparable to, or exceeding that provided by MeBr. Both steam treatments\
    \ also reduced M. arenaria in snapdragon roots comparable to, or exceeding control\
    \ with MeBr. Meloidogyne arenaria in soil increased in solarization alone. Solarization\
    \ alone also had higher gall ratings on larkspur, snapdragon, and sunflower than\
    \ all other treatments. Steam provided excellent control of M. arenaria in this\
    \ study."
