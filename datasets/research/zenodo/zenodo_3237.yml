  abstract: <em>In the article, the study of the stable movement of the working bodies
    on the working depth of the working bodies, which are movably attached to the
    frame and not equipped with a support device, in the soil tillage machines used
    in the agricultural production of our Republic, is the study of the stable movements
    of the working depth. the results of theoretical research on</em>
