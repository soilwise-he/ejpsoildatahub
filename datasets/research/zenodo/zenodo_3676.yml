  title: Application Of Metarhizium Anisopliae Against Meloidogyne Javanica In Soil
    Amended With Oak Debris
  abstract: "Tomato (<em>Lycopersicon esculentum</em> Mill.) is one of the most popular,\
    \ widely grown and the second most important vegetable crop, after potatoes. Nematodes\
    \ have been identified as one of the major pests affecting tomato production throughout\
    \ the world. The most destructive nematodes are the genus <em>Meloidogyne</em>.\
    \ Most widespread and devastating species of this genus are <em>M. incognita</em>,\
    \ <em>M. javanica</em>, and <em>M. arenaria</em>. These species can cause complete\
    \ crop loss under adverse growing conditions. There are several potential methods\
    \ for management of the root knot nematodes. Although the chemicals are widely\
    \ used against the phytonematodes, because of hazardous effects of these compounds\
    \ on non-target organisms and on the environment, there is a need to develop other\
    \ control strategies. Nowadays, non-chemical measures are widely used to control\
    \ the plant parasitic nematodes. Biocontrol of phytonematodes is an important\
    \ method among environment-friendly measures of nematode management. There are\
    \ some soil-inhabiting fungi that have biocontrol potential on phytonematodes,\
    \ which can be used in nematode management program. The fungus <em>Metarhizium\
    \ anisopliae</em>, originally is an entomopathogenic bioagent. Biocontrol potential\
    \ of this fungus on some phytonematodes has been reported earlier. Recently, use\
    \ of organic soil amendments as well as the use of bioagents is under special\
    \ attention in sustainable agriculture. This research aimed to reduce the pesticide\
    \ use in control of root-knot nematode, <em>Meloidogyne javanica</em> in tomato.\
    \ The effects of <em>M. anisopliae</em> IMI 330189 and different levels of oak\
    \ tree debris on <em>M. javanica </em>were determined. The combination effect\
    \ of the fungus as well as the different rates of soil amendments was determined.\
    \ Pots were filled with steam pasteurized soil mixture and the six leaf tomato\
    \ seedlings were inoculated with 3000 second stage larvae of <em>M. javanica</em>/kg\
    \ of soil. After eight weeks, plant growth parameters and nematode reproduction\
    \ factors were compared. Based on the results of our experiment, combination of\
    \ <em>M. anisopliae</em> IMI 330189 and oak debris caused more than 90% reduction\
    \ in reproduction factor of nematode, at the rates of 100 and 150 g/kg soil (P\
    \ \u2264 0.05). As compared to control, the reduction in number of galls was 76%.\
    \ It was 86% for nematode reproduction factor, showing the significance of combined\
    \ effect of both tested agents. Our results showed that plant debris can increase\
    \ the biological activity of the tested bioagent. It was also proved that there\
    \ was no adverse effect of oak debris, which potentially has antimicrobial activity,\
    \ on antagonistic power of applied bioagent."
