  title: LEGAL SUPPORT TO THE PROTECTION OF LAND AND SOIL IN LIGHT OF NEW REGULATIONS
    OF UKRAINE
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;In this article, regulations on land and soil protection are studied
    in a chronological sequence and in the historical and legal contexts. The main
    factors responsible for the deterioration of the quality of land resources and
    the soil environment are identified. The modern regulatory framework providing
    legal support to land and soil protection is analyzed. Among the current problems
    is the improper land-use triggered by inadequate legal regulation concerning pollution,
    depletion, degradation, and reduced fertility of soil. Appropriate legal protection
    to the ecological functions of the soil is absent. Further legal framework addressing
    rational use and protection of land resources (including soil) in Ukraine should
    be developed integrating environmental interests of society and ecological tenets
    of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;'
