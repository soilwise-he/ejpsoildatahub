  title: Soil Profile Description and Classification (WRB-2006) of the 11 Flemish
    Level II Intensive Monitoring Plots
  abstract: "In the late 80s Flanders set up a forest monitoring network within the\
    \ framework of the International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring\
    \ of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) operating under the UN/ECE\
    \ Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. ICP Forests monitors the\
    \ forest condition in Europe in cooperation with the European Commission using\
    \ two different monitoring intensity levels. The first level (Level I) is based\
    \ on about 6000 observation plots on a systematic transnational grid of 16 x 16\
    \ km throughout Europe. The intensive monitoring level comprises about 800 Level\
    \ II plots in selected forest ecosystems in Europe. At present the Flemish network\
    \ comprises 11 international Level II plots. Within the EU demonstration project\
    \ \u2018BioSoil\u2019, Flanders made a soil inventory on these 11 Level II plots.\
    \ This document reports on the soil survey which includes a detailed profile pit\
    \ description and soil characterisation complemented by laboratory data. The finality\
    \ of this characterisation was to come to a soil classification name for the concerning\
    \ Level II plot according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS\
    \ Working Group WRB, 2006)."
