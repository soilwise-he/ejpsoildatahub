  title: Soil and Water Microorganism Diversity of Mangrove Forest of Teluk Kelumpang,
    Selat Laut and Selat Sebuku Natural Reserve
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Mangrove is a unique ecosystem that has complex biotic and abiotic
    components. Soil and water microorganisms have function as decomposer in mangrove
    forest ecosystem.&nbsp; This paper studies the soil and water microorganisms&#39;
    diversity, their potential, function in ecosystem and their role as environmental
    parameters in mangrove area of&nbsp; Teluk Kelumpang, Selat Laut and Selat Sebuku
    Natural Reserve (Kelautku Natural Reserve).&nbsp; Data of&nbsp; soil and water
    microorganisms were recorded from soil and water samplings then analyzed in the
    laboratory.&nbsp; Results show that benthos in Selat Sebuku figure the highest
    diversity index.&nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Anadara granosa&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp; is one of&nbsp;
    the common benthos found in Selat Sebuku.&nbsp; In contrary the phytoplankton
    in Selat Sebuku is the lowest value compared to the other two locations, due to
    the settlements in the locations and it was suspected that Selat Sebuku has a
    relatively larger wave exposure than the two other locations.&nbsp; In addition,
    input of organic matters from the settlements in Teluk Kelumpang and Selat Laut
    is also effected&nbsp; by the growth of&nbsp;&nbsp; phytoplankton.&nbsp; Cyanophyta
    found in Teluk Kelumpang and Selat Laut was genera of&nbsp; Oscillatoria that
    showed high tolerance genera to&nbsp; the environment conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
