  title: Effect of Waste Cloth on the Properties of Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: The black cotton soil is mainly inorganic clay and owns medium to high
    compressibility, this soil also referred as expansive soil. The properties of
    the soil are influenced by the environment condition the soil gets swell during
    winter season and shrinks during summer seasons .the black cotton soil was unable
    to withstand the high impact load from the heavy structures due to constant change
    in properties of the soil parallel to environmental condition, in order to make
    it possible the black cotton soils are get mixed with the stabilizing materials
    ,in the same manner in this analysis the black cotton soil properties are analyzed
    by using waste cloth. The highlighting reason for using waste cloth is because
    of its easy availability, eco-friendly and its fibrous properties. the waste cloth
    are collected from the cloth shop and stitching shop, the black cotton soils are
    collected from the city of Bhalki.
