  title: Soil Classification and Crop Recommendation System
  abstract: In this project we will be making a Soil Classification and Crop Recommendation
    System. This appplication will help the farmers to test the quality of the soil
    for the cultivation, so the farmers no need of going to the laboratories for testing
    the soil. By checking this we can find which crop can give more yield. With the
    help of a smartphone the farmers can test the soil by themselves. We are implementing
    this system by applying machine learning algorithm. The models are trained on
    the basis of a large dataset, so it will increase the accuracy of the model.
