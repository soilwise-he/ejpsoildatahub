  title: Smart Irrigation System using Soil Moisture Sensor
  abstract: <strong>The irrigation system may be a method that ensures that each one
    plants get enough water for growth. However, thanks to the climate exchange, especially
    in season, the soil tends to lose its moisture. Although, the automated irrigation
    system has been applied within the agriculture sector, water consumption and energy
    can't be controlled through this technique thanks to the system operated under
    time delay. Usually, farmers only can turn on or off the system manually depends
    on the weather. Consequently, this paper presented the computerized water system
    framework utilizing android- based application remote correspondence. The framework
    includes a dispersed remote system of soil-dampness, stickiness and temperature
    sensors. Utilizing this framework, the observing and controlling water system
    should be possible by means of Android application from any area.</strong>
