  title: Qualitative and Quantitative Screening of Actinomycetes from Farmland and
    Rhizospheric Soil
  abstract: 'Farmland soil and rhizospheric soil were screened for the presence of
    antibiotic producing Actinomycetes. Using culture based techniques. Isolates were
    isolated suaing two media: Starch Casein Agar medium and Actinomycetes Isolation
    Agar (AIA) medium. Isolates were characterized morphologically and biochemically
    and identified to be in the genus Actinomycetes. Ten isolates were isolated with
    varied qualitative and quantitative spectrum of activity against Multidrug resistant
    Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi,
    and Candida albicans. The quantitative antimicrobial assay recorded a zone of
    inhibition of 0-26mm diameter of zone of inhibition. Results show that the soil
    samples are important sources of antibiotics for the fight of Multidrug resistant
    isolates.Read Complete Article at ijSciences: V82019042041 AND DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18483/ijSci.2041'
