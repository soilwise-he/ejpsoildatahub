  title: Improvement of soft soil for road construction on the north brebes tegal
    ring road project
  abstract: The Brebes-Tegal North Ring Road is a primary arterial road located in
    the Central Java North Coast (Pantura) corridor that crosses Brebes Regency (12,385
    km) and Tegal City (4,715 km), this road was built with the aim of breaking up
    the traffic congestion that occurred in the City Center of Brebes and Tegal City.
    In 2010, the construction of the Brebes-Tegal North Ring Road began. However,
    in 2013 development activities temporarily stopped due to a number of problems,
    one of which was the condition of the soil at some of the construction sites in
    the form of swamps and ponds resulting in low soil carrying capacity which affected
    the construction of roads on it. This condition starts from STA. 8+800 to STA.
    17+377 from the direction of Brebes to Tegal. therefore, in December 2019 the
    project was resumed with a design change to improve the subgrade so that it could
    withstand the burden of road construction and passing traffic. Soil improvement
    is carried out using geotextiles, PVD and PHD in the selected soil embankment
    work process so as to increase the CBR value of the subgrade for the better (higher
    CBR). In addition, in bridge construction work it is necessary to use pile slabs
    to prevent high pile failures.
