  title: The Effect of Electrokinetic Remediation on the Index Properties of Lead-Contaminated
    Lateritic Soil
  abstract: <em>Soil contamination is a global concern that has great effects on human
    health, groundwater, and the engineering properties of soil. The aim of this paper
    is to use the electrokinetic remediation technique to remove lead contaminants
    from lateritic soil and evaluate the index properties of the remediated soil.
    Contaminated soil specimens were prepared by mixing the lateritic soil with a
    maximum 1% lead nitrate concentration in a stepwise increment of 0.2% by weight
    of dry soil. Thereafter, the soil was remediated in an electrokinetic cell using
    graphite electrodes with acetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
    as electrolytes. The results obtained shows a liquid limit and the plasticity
    index of electrokinetic lead remediated soil decreased from 52.00 to 39.60% and
    29.09 to 17.59%, respectively. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the electrokinetic
    lead remediated soil increased from 5.31 to 8.20 Cmolkg-1 after the electrokinetic
    process, while the liner shrinkage decreased from 12.14 to 5.0 %. The percentage
    passing the BS NO 200 sieve ranges from 7.68 to 5.85 for British Standard Light
    (BSL), 5.09 to 5.50 for West African Standard (WAS), and 10.4 to 5.60 for British
    Standard Heavy (BSH). Furthermore, the percentage of gravel for BSL ranges from
    1.6 to 14 for BSL, 1.6 to 13.4 for WAS, and 1.7 to 3.5 for BSH. Overall, the electrokinetic
    technique proved to be effective in removing lead from contaminated lateritic
    soil and improving its index properties. Results obtained provide valuable insight
    into the remediation of contaminated soil using the electrokinetic technique</em><em>.</em>
