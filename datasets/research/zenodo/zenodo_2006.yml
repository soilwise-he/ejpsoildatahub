  title: Evaluation of Vertical Bearing Capacity for H section Steel Pile with Soil
    cement Ground Improvement
  abstract: In recent years, works to improve existing structures and strengthen their
    seismic resistance have increased. Pile<br> construction in narrow spaces is constrained
    by the site and process. Furthermore, noise and industrial waste need to<br> be
    considered with regard to their effects on the surrounding environment. Therefore,
    a construction method of H<br> section steel pile construction combined with soil
    cement ground improvement using a mechanical agitator was<br> developed. This
    method is characterized by having no need to drill up to a fixed depth as in the
    pre boring pile<br> construction method. Instead, soil is agitated along with
    the cement milk at the original position. In this study, static<br> compression
    load tests on the soil-cement composite pile that were constructed with the mechanical
    agitator ground<br> improvement method were carried out to evaluate the vertical
    bearing capacity. Furthermore, it was evaluated the<br> performance of vertical
    bearing capacity on the H-section steel piles with soil-cement ground improvement
    to compare<br> the evaluation method as shown in the design specifications in
    Japan.
