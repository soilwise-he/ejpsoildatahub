  title: IMPORTANCE OF PERENNIAL WHEAT IN IMPROVING SOIL STRUCTURE AND OBTAINING GREEN
    MASS
  abstract: Using traditional breeding methods, perennial wheat varieties have been
    created that combine the characteristics of annual wheat. The peculiarity of these
    varieties is that after the wheat crop is harvested, wheat grows again from the
    root mass and can be used for a second harvest or as pasture for livestock. Perennial
    wheat varieties allow to further improve the condition of eroded and degraded
    soils, which have become a problem for a long time, and make it possible to make
    rational use of unproductive lands.
