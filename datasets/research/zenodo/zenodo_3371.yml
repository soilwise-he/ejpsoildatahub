  title: Soil Moisture Content In Hill-Filed Side Slope
  abstract: 'The soil moisture content is an important property of

    the soil. The results of mean weekly gravimetric soil moisture

    content, measured for the three soil layers within the A horizon,

    showed that it was higher for the top 5 cm over the whole period of

    monitoring (15/7/2004 up to 10/11/05) with the variation becoming

    greater during winter time. This reflects the pattern of rainfall in

    Ireland which is spread over the whole year and shows that light

    rainfall events during summer time were compensated by loss

    through evapotranspiration, but only in the top 5 cm of soil. This

    layer had the highest porosity and highest moisture holding capacity

    due to the high content of organic matter. The gravimetric soil

    moisture contents of the top 5 cm and the underlying 5-15 and 15-25

    cm layers show that bottom site of the Hill Field had higher soil

    moisture content than the middle and top sites during the whole

    period of monitoring.'
