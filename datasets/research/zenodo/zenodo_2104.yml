  title: ROOT PLASTICITY AND YIELD RESPONSE OF RICE IN THREE SOIL TYPES AND VARYING
    LEVELS OF PHOSPHOROUS
  abstract: "The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three soil types and\
    \ varying level of Phosphorus on root plasticity and yield of rice at Salinungan\
    \ West, San Mateo, Isabela from January 26, 2022 to May 14, 2022. The experiment\
    \ was laid out in a Completely Randomized Design in Factorial with three replications.\
    \ The three (3) soil types namely, S1- Quinqua Silty Clay Loam, S2- Bago Sandy\
    \ Clay Loam and S3- Santa Rita Clay Loam were designated as Factor A while the\
    \ three Phosphorus namely, F1\u2013 10 kg per hectare, F2\u201320 kg per hectare,\
    \ F3 \u2013 30 kg per hectare, were designated as Factor B. F1 was used as the\
    \ standard check for phosphorus application. Santa Rita Clay Loam obtained the\
    \ heaviest root weight, most number of productive tillers and heaviest weight\
    \ of 1000 grains. The application of 30 kg P per hectare consistently resulted\
    \ into longest roots with 22.48 cm, 35.20 cm, and 39.81 cm at 30, 60 and 90 DAT,\
    \ respectively. Similarly, it resulted to the heaviest roots with 13.21 (30 DAT),\
    \ 99.83 cm (60 DAT) and 128.29 grams (90 DAT). It also had the heaviest shoot\
    \ of 16.51, 212.71 and 270.97 grams at 30, 60 and 90 DAT and biomass at 90.06\
    \ grams (30 DAT), 937.63 grams (60 DAT) and 1,197.20 grams (90 DAT). Also, the\
    \ application of 30 kg P per hectare produced the most number of productive tillers\
    \ with 15.04 per pot, filled grains per panicle of 130.85, weight of 1000 grains\
    \ of 27.19 grams and yield per pot of 53.51 grams. Therefore, Santa Rita Clay\
    \ Loam and the application of additional 30 kg P per hectare are recommended for\
    \ rice production."
