  title: Effect Of Soak Pit On The Consolidation Behavior Of Three Zone Soil In Karnataka
  abstract: The present research work discuss about the consolidation behavior of
    three zone soil which are collected  neat soak pit regions from kanakapura, Hoskote
    and Dodaballapur, Karnataka, India at a depth of 0.5  meters from natural ground
    level  and at a  radial distance of 2.5 meters away from the pit area by using
    auger boring. In the above regions human excreta with sewage is directly discharged
    into these pits. From the pit contaminants will travel a maximum distance of 10
    meters and also may travel vertically downwards and pollute the underground water
    and it also affects the engineering behavior of soil. So we are interested to
    know the consolidation characteristics of these regions soil. An attempt also
    made to have a consolidation comparative study of three above specified zone soil
    due to intrusion of contaminants. From the one dimensional fixed ring Consolidation
    test it is observed that Hoskote soil requires higher Pre-Consolidation pressure
    and hence its rate of permeability is less compared to other soils on the other
    hand Dodballapur soil requires lower Pre-Consolidation pressure for Consolidation
    of soil. This reflects the softening of soil due to contaminants intrusion near
    soak pit area.
