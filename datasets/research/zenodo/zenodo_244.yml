  title: A first-year melon/cowpea intercropping system improves soil nutrients and
    changes the soil microbial community
  abstract: "The melon/cowpea intercropping system can be a specific and efficient\
    \ cropping pattern in a horticultural field. Intercropping systems contribute\
    \ to the optimization of land use, fostering sustainable and efficient agriculture.\
    \ This study entails a first-year comparative intercropping assay using cowpea\
    \ (Vigna unguiculata) and melon (Cucumis melo) under organic management with different\
    \ patterns and 30% less organic fertilization than usual in monocrops. We determined\
    \ the soil nutrients, physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and microbes\
    \ by high-throughput sequencing. We found that the intercropping system changed\
    \ the bacterial community structure independently of the intercropping pattern.\
    \ The bacterial community was characterized by a higher abundance of the phyla\
    \ Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla and of the genus Pseudomonas, which are\
    \ related to nutrient cycling, and by greater amounts of other beneficial microorganisms\
    \ like Bacillus, Streptomyces and Sphingomonas. The intercropped systems significantly\
    \ boosted the total nitrogen, available phosphorus and total organic carbon levels\
    \ in addition to the melon yield. They also enhanced the acid phosphatase and\
    \ \u03B2-glucosidase activity compared to the melon monocrop. Results from this\
    \ study suggest that melon/cowpea intercropping, starting from the first year,\
    \ not only provides a stable supply of food and income due to the diversified\
    \ cropping systems, but is also beneficial for the soil microbial community and\
    \ environment."
