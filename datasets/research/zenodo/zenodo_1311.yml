  title: Soil microbial status under different land use systems in Gombe state, Nigeria
  abstract: "Microorganisms are of primary importance for soil quality and natural\
    \ productivity. Four land use systems viz., Forestry, Horticulture, Agriculture\
    \ and Pasture at four different locations viz., Bajoga, Gombe, Boderi and Kanawa\
    \ were identified in determining population of microorganisms in the soil. The\
    \ samples were collected, numbered and labelled with date and site of collection\
    \ in an air-tight pre-sterilized polyethene bags before transportation to the\
    \ laboratory. Serial dilution pour plate technique was used for estimation of\
    \ total bacterial, fungal, actnomycetes and azotobacter using specific media.\
    \ The plates were incubated at temperatures specific to particular microbe for\
    \ 2 \u2013 3 days. The colonies that developed on media were counted by electronic\
    \ colony counter. The microbial counts were expressed as colony forming unit per\
    \ gram of soil (CFU/g soil). The highest bacterial count (CFU/g) was found in\
    \ forest land use with the mean value (192.66) and the lowest (41.33) was found\
    \ in agricultural land use system. The highest total fungal count (CFU/g) was\
    \ recorded in forest land use with the mean value (77.33) and the lowest (10.33)\
    \ was found in agricultural land use system. The highest total viable actinomycetes\
    \ count (CFU/g) was recorded in forest land use with the mean value (62) and the\
    \ lowest (3) was found in agricultural land use system as compared to other soils\
    \ in the study area. The perusal of data reveals that for the total azotobacter\
    \ count (CFU/g), the highest was recorded in forest soils because of the presence\
    \ of more organic matter with mean value (22.66) as compared with the other land\
    \ use systems. The lowest was found in agriculture (4.33). Lowest microbial count\
    \ in agricultural soils may result to poor soil quality and natural productivity\
    \ which may lead to famine a natural disaster. Planting of cover crops will improve\
    \ soil structure, enhance soil fertility and sustain or increase soil organic\
    \ matter and soil biological activity."
