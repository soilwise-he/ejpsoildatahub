  title: Short-term changes in soil biochemical properties as affected by subsidiary
    crop cultivation in four European pedo-climatic zones
  abstract: "The goals of conservation agriculture are to preserve and enhance the\
    \ soil resource base and the environment. Subsidiary crops (SCs), such as Trifolium,\
    \ Medicago, Vicia, Brassica, Raphanus spp., are important components of conservation\
    \ agriculture since they maintain the soil resource. However, the importance of\
    \ SC species and environment on soil microbial communities are not well known.\
    \ The overall objective of this study was to assess the effect of various subsidiary\
    \ crops cultivation on soil microbial biomass and activity at four sites across\
    \ Europe. The experiments were conducted during 2014 and 2015 at sites in the\
    \ Nemoral (Sweden SLU), Oceanic (United Kingdom ORC), Continental (Switzerland\
    \ AGS) and Mediterranean north (Italy UNI) pedo-climatic zones. The specific objectives\
    \ were to determine: (i) the effect of SC growth on soil microbial biomass and\
    \ activity, (ii) the site-specific effect of SC growth on soil biochemical properties.\
    \ The SCs consisted of leguminous or brassicaceous species sown after wheat harvest,\
    \ or clover species under-sown in wheat. At 0<strong>\u2013</strong>30 cm depth,\
    \ microbial carbon and nitrogen increased under SCs at most sites indicating that\
    \ SCs cultivation may favor soil biological fertility. Effects of SCs were similar\
    \ in the pedo-climatic zones where air temperatures are never below 0 \xB0C (ORC\
    \ and UNI). Arylsulphatase was the most sensitive enzyme to legumes in the Mediterranean\
    \ north (UNI). Chitinase activity was enhanced by SCs in the Oceanic and Nemoral\
    \ pedo-climatic zones. High precipitation and the low average temperature, typical\
    \ of Continental and Nemoral zones, may represent limiting factors for soil enzyme\
    \ activity under all selected SCs. Among the four pedo-climatic zones, the Mediterranean\
    \ north represented the most suitable environment to promote SC growth and soil\
    \ coverage. This study showed that SC cultivation affects soil quality enhancing\
    \ biochemical activity; however the SCs effect were influenced by the different\
    \ pedo-climatic conditions. Papp, R., Marinari, S., <strong>Moscatelli, M.C.,</strong>\
