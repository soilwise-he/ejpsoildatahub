  title: Review on Investigate the Growth Responses of Rooting and Shooting Performance
    of Populus alba Cuttings Grown in Hydroponic and Soil Cultures Environments
  abstract: 'Populus spp (poplars) are fast growing multipurpose trees. They have
    immense potential to benefit mankind and to protect the environment. In order
    to investigate the effects of biochar, Azolla and moss as components of growth
    media on root formation and shooting performance in mini cuttings of populace,
    an experiment was conducted using plastic bottles in a greenhouse in hydroponic
    and soil media. The experiment was established on three different rooting media:
    sand, water and soil enriched with three concentrations (0gm, 10gm and 25gm per
    L of the amendments; (biochar Azolla and moss), with randomized block design,
    each block containing three replicates. The cutting length, cutting thickness
    and ages of cuttings were used to see root establishments. The data revealed the
    significant effect of different amendments and rooting media on the populus establishment.
    The rooted mini-cuttings were assessed for rooting percent; number of roots, root
    length, number of leaves and shoots height as well. In the study finding among
    all the amendments and rooting media, moss (25 gm L-1) showed better results with
    water in terms of rooting percent (100%), number of roots (16.33), root length
    (19.83cm) and number of leaves (45.33) per rooted mini-cuttings. The formation
    of healthy plants after hardening under outdoor conditions showed that populus
    alba could be successfully propagated by mini-cutting techniques.'
