  title: Comparative analysis of heavy metals concentration in soil and vegetable
    (Solanum lycopersicum) collected from two sampling sites (Farmland and Dumpsite)
    and the effect on plant DNA
  abstract: "One of the most popular crops with a unique role in human diets especially\
    \ in Nigeria is <em>Solanum Lycopersicum</em>. The study investigated the levels\
    \ of heavy metals (cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb)and zinc(Zn)\
    \ and nutrients(nitrogen (N), phosphorus(P) and potassium(K) in the leaf, stem\
    \ and root of <em>Solanum lycopersicum </em>and soil collected from dumpsite (in\
    \ Ojota) and Farmland (in Badagry) in Lagos, Nigeria and their effects on <em>S.\
    \ lycopersicum </em>using DNA analysis. The results recorded in mg/100g showed\
    \ that only the value of Zn in stem of <em>S. lycopersicum</em> from farmland\
    \ (77.671 \xB1 2.193) was significantly higher than that of dumpsite (72.169 \xB1\
    \ 1.656) while Zn in the root <em>S. lycopersicum</em> from farmland (66.556 \xB1\
    \ 0.613) was significantly lower than that of dumpsite (71.760\xB12.699). The\
    \ values of K in the stem and root, P in the leaf, and N in the stem and root\
    \ were higher in samples from farmland, while samples from dumpsite had higher\
    \ value of N in leaf, P in stem and root and K in leaf. Only, Zn in the soil was\
    \ significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) at dumpsite than farmland. The values of N,\
    \ P and K in soil from dumpsite were higher (p&lt;0.05) than that from farmland.\
    \ The DNA bands of the <em>Solanum lycopersicum </em>from control site and dumpsite\
    \ site have no alteration. In conclusion, all the metal levels did not exceed\
    \ World Health Organization limits and thus <em>S. lycopersicum</em> is safe for\
    \ human consumption."
