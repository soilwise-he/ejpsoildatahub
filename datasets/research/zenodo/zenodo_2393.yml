  title: The Effects of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Rice Nutrients and Soil
    Properties in Taungoo University Campus
  abstract: Agricultural systems are a major factor affecting human health. Soil is
    one of the important factors for successful cropping in agriculture. The objective
    of this research was to investigate the effects of control, organic and inorganic
    fertilizers on soil properties and rice nutrients at Taungoo University Farm.
    The experiment comprised three treatments viz., control (without fertilizer),
    organic farming (organic manures including paddy and black gram straw, cow dung)
    and conventional farming (chemical fertilizers including N, P, K). Soil samples
    were collected before and after paddy cultivation and analyzed to study the changes
    in soil properties as influenced by organic farming. Increase in physicochemical
    properties (moisture, organic carbon, humus), nutrients (N, P, K) and decrease
    in Fe, Mg contents were noticed in the soil under organic farming when compared
    to conventional and control farming after paddy cultivation. The nutritional values
    of the collected rice samples from organic, conventional and control farming such
    as moisture, ash, fat, fiber and protein were determined by AOAC methods. Mineral
    contents of rice samples such as K, Na, Ca, Mg and Fe were determined by atomic
    absorption spectrophotometer. A substantial increase in protein, fiber and decrease
    in fat were observed in the rice under organic farming. In the above context,
    it was observed that organic fertilizer caused better quality, safety and nutrition
    of rice as well as richer soil health.
