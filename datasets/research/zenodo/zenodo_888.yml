  title: Comparative analysis of soil organic carbon in selected river catchments
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The present study deals with the investigation of soil organic\
    \ carbon in two water catchments in Northern Rila, Western Bulgaria. Field research,\
    \ combined with analysis, provided sufficient data. Six key sites were selected\
    \ and sampled in order to estimate and compare the amount of organic and inorganic\
    \ carbon in the topsoil. The applied criteria for the choice of sites included:\
    \ vegetation cover, predominant soil group, level of anthropogenization and transport\
    \ accessibility. A total number of 13 samples from both catchments were collected\
    \ and analyzed in the Central laboratory of the Institute of Soil Science, Agrotechnologies\
    \ and Plant Protection (ISSAPP) \"N. Pushkarov\". The results concern the amount\
    \ and composition of soil organic matter in different soils \u2013 Cambisols (Albic,\
    \ Humic, Dystric), Fluvisols and Umbrosols. The total carbon content of all samples\
    \ varies between 1.23 and 9.69%. The amount of organic carbon ranges between 0.45\
    \ and 3.73%. The results of the study prove once again that the preservation of\
    \ natural vegetation and current condition of the soil is of great importance\
    \ for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;"
