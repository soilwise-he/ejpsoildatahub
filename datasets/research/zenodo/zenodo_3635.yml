  title: Study Of Performance Of Geogrid And Soil Interface Using Vertical Pullout
    Test
  abstract: <em>The use of geosynthetics is to improve the performance of foundations
    when constructing on soft compressible foundation soils. The material properties
    of geosynthetics are important to their use in various applications. Geosynthetics
    have become well established construction materials for geotechnical and environmental
    applications in most parts of the world. This report presents a vertical pullout
    test (VPT) developed to measure the peak interface friction angle and cohesion
    between soil and planar geosynthetic products. Two types of geo-synthetic material
    of different sizes (150mm by 150mm and 300mm by 300mm) were evaluated using the
    pullout test. Series of pull-out tests were performed to study the interface characteristics
    between geogrids and soils. Two geogrids were used to investigate the interaction
    properties with clay. The function of geogrid reinforcement and the geogrid-soil
    interaction mechanism were mainly studied by experimental methods. </em>
