  title: "Digging deep\u2014implementation, standardisation and interpretation of\
    \ a total oxidisable precursor (TOP) assay within the regulatory context of per-\
    \ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in soil"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, thousands of different per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances (PFASs) have been produced and&lt;br&gt;

    applied in various industrial processes and consumer products. Their structural
    diversity has reached a level that cannot&lt;br&gt;

    be covered by classical target screening methods for individual compounds. Large-scale
    contaminations of soil,&lt;br&gt;

    however, require the need to adapt new analytical methods that can describe a
    contamination more comprehensively.&lt;br&gt;

    While sum parameters such as the total oxidisable precursor (TOP) assay have been
    developed in the past years,&lt;br&gt;

    they are not yet applied in the regulatory context of PFASs.&lt;br&gt;

    In this commentary, we provide an overview on different approaches of the TOP
    assay as well as its benefits and&lt;br&gt;

    disadvantages to other sum parameters for PFASs in soil samples. Furthermore,
    we elaborate its opportunities and its&lt;br&gt;

    challenges that need to be tackled to implement the TOP assay as a regulatory
    tool. With several different approaches&lt;br&gt;

    of the TOP assay being available, a sound and standardised method needs to be
    agreed upon and more research is&lt;br&gt;

    necessary to better describe the method. Although the complexity of PFAS contaminations
    in soil cannot be fully&lt;br&gt;

    covered by any analytical method alone, the TOP assay can provide valuable data
    to detect and characterise soil contamination&lt;br&gt;

    as an inventory for subsequent remediation measures. Therefore, the TOP assay
    should be implemented as&lt;br&gt;

    a useful tool both in research and in the regulatory context of PFASs.&lt;br&gt;
