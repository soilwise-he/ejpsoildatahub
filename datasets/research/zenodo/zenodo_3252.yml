  title: Study on use of Red Mud with RBI Grade 81 in Black Cotton Soil to Enhancing
    the Properties of Sub Grade and Base Layer of Re Wall and Semi Rigid Pavement
  abstract: 'Soil is very important in civil engineering constructions. The poor engineering
    properties of the local soils may present many difficulties for construction and
    therefore need to improve their engineering properties. Stabilization techniques
    can be used to improve the properties of soil. Soil stabilization improves various
    engineering properties e.g. bearing capacity, compressibility, strength, and various
    other properties of soil. In this study the impact of Red Mud to improve the strength
    of soil.An effective stabilizer i.e. RBI Grade 81 polymer used as an chemical
    additive and can also be used in sub grade, sub base and base layer.The industrial
    waste like Fly Ash, Stone Dust, Red Mud etc. can be used with RBI Grade 81 as
    stabilizer to reduce the cost. The strength has been compared on the basis of
    CBR for virgin soil and soil with red mud with RBI grade un soaked and soaked
    conditions.The result implies that when sub grade is reinforced with Red mud and
    RBI grade 81 its CBR increases as for virgin soil and it increases for un soaked
    and Soked condition.Red Mud and RBI grade 81 has a good potential to reduce the
    cost of pavement layers if weak sub grade is encountered on the alignment. Abhishek
