  title: 'Response to sewage sludge fertilisation in a Quercus rubra L. silvopastoral
    system: Soil, plant biodiversity and tree and pasture production'
  abstract: "Silvopastoral systems are sustainable form of land management promoted\
    \ by European Union. The productivity of the herbaceous and tree components in\
    \ a silvopastoral system could be limited by soil fertility. The use of adequate\
    \ doses of organic fertilisers like sewage sludge could enhance the productivity\
    \ of both pasture and trees and promote biodiversity. The quantification of the\
    \ best dose of sewage sludge to be applied in a silvopastoral system is important\
    \ in order to enhance production and biodiversity in a silvopastoral system, while\
    \ avoiding nitrate contamination of the ground water. This study aims to evaluate\
    \ the effects of different doses of sewage sludge (100 kg total N ha\u22121, 200\
    \ kg total N ha\u22121 and 400 kg total N ha\u22121) on different variables of\
    \ soil (soil pH, effective exchange capacity and the saturation percentage of\
    \ Al, K, Ca, Mg and Na), tree growth and pasture (production, species richness\
    \ and botanical composition) as compared to the fertilisation treatment in a silvopastoral\
    \ system under Quercus rubra L. Sewage sludge applications initially improved\
    \ soil nutrient levels (effective exchange capacity and Ca saturation percentage)\
    \ and subsequently pasture production and tree growth when 200 and 400 kg of total\
    \ N ha\u22121 were applied. On the other hand, the establishment of pasture and\
    \ trees improved soil conditions at a medium term due to the organic matter input\
    \ into the sandy soil, which increased species diversity specially at a 100 kg\
    \ of total N ha\u22121 dose."
