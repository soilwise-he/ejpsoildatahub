  title: Ground Water Management And Soil Conservation Of Korayar Watershed Through
    Remote Sensing And Gis
  abstract: Watershed management is often seen as a potential engine for agricultural
    growth and development in fragile and marginal rain-fed areas India. Enhanced
    livelihood opportunities for watershed community through investment in their assets
    and improvements in income and productivity are the leading objective of the programme,
    as mentioned in the guidelines for watershed management programme (WMP) in India.  Watershed
    management may be defined as an integrated approach of greenery for a better environment.
    The management is essential for preceding the natural ecosystem in the catchment
    areas of rivers. The current research aims at developing an integrated water and
    soil conservation plan for Korayar watershed with in an adaptive management framework
    using geospatial tools. The soil and water conservation for watershed management
    process is among the requisites that need to be considered for the control of
    sedimentation and soil erosion. Other elements like climate, edaphic factors,
    land management, topography, and land cover, etc. will also determine the sedimentation
    and soil erosion process. Integrated Watershed Management approach is a worthy
    approach to manage the ecological, social and economic watershed development challenges
    in countries. The study chosen Korayar watershed area extent Coimbatore and Palakkad
    district, using remote sensing and GIS.To study and Mapping of the watershed through
    SOI with 1:50,000 scale, suitable Remote sensing data with available secondary
    information for soil conservatio<em>n.</em>
