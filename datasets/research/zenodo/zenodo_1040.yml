  title: Pedoclimatic zone-based three-dimensional soil organic carbon mapping in
    China
  abstract: "Up-to-date maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations can provide\
    \ vital information for monitoring global or regional soil C changes and soil\
    \ quality. In this study, a national soil dataset collected in the 2010 s was\
    \ applied to produce SOC maps of mainland China at soil depths of 0\u20135 cm,\
    \ 5\u201315 cm, 15\u201330 cm, 30\u201360 cm, 60\u2013100 cm and 100\u2013200\
    \ cm. A stacking ensemble learning framework was utilized to take advantage of\
    \ the optimal predictions from individual models. A voting-based ensemble learning\
    \ model (VELM) was proposed with consideration of pedoclimatic zones. In this\
    \ model, three machine learning models were separately trained for every pedoclimatic\
    \ zone, and their predictions were selectively merged together. A weighted ensemble\
    \ learning model (WELM), in which the parameterization considered all zones (i.e.,\
    \ the whole study area) simultaneously, was also trained for comparison. The overall\
    \ R2 values of these two methods ranged from 0.16 to 0.57 and decreased with depth.\
    \ Based on the independent validation, the R2 values ranged from 0.41 to 0.57\
    \ in the topsoil (0\u20135 cm, 5\u201315 cm and 15\u201330 cm). Overall accuracy\
    \ metrics implied that the VELM and WELM yielded nearly the same prediction performances.\
    \ However, model validation in the pedoclimatic zones showed that the VELM obviously\
    \ outperformed the WELM, with the VELM generally improving the accuracy by 12.6%.\
    \ Based on the independent validation, we also compared our predictions with other\
    \ soil map products. Although the spatial patterns were similar, the predicted\
    \ SOC maps outperformed two other products. The comparison of the two ensemble\
    \ models should serve as a reminder that if new national or regional soil maps\
    \ are generated, validation based on pedoclimatic zones or other soil-landscape\
    \ units may be necessary before applying these maps."
