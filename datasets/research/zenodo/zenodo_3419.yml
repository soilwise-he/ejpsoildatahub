  title: Isolation And Biochemical Characterization Of Biosurfactant From Soil Sample
  abstract: The present study aimed to isolate and characterize bio surfactants bacteria.
    Biosurfactants are surface active compound like chemical surfactants but synthesized
    by microbes like bacteria, fungi and yeast. Biosurfactants comprise the properties
    of dropping surface tension, stabilizing emulsions, promoting foaming and are
    usually non-toxic and biodegradable. Bio surfactant showed diversity, flexibility
    in operation, and more ecofriendly than chemical surfactant. Bio surfactants are
    thermotolerant, halo bacteria and oil degrading in nature, which help in various
    industrial applications in near future. Biosurfactants are produced by a variety
    of microorganisms mainly bacteria, fungi and yeasts are diverse in chemical composition
    and their nature and the amount depend on the type of microbes producing a particular
    biosurfactant. And in resulting wide variety of biosurfactant can be produced
    accordingly to the demand and uses. The advantage of biosurfactants reported by
    several scientists from worldwide and compared their efficiency with chemically
    synthesized pesticides and drugs aimed to screen effective bio surfactant producing
    bacteria. Biochemical characterization of biosurfactant contributes for the social
    benefits. Biosurfactants are biodegradability, generally low toxicity biocompatibility
    and digestibility which allow their application in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals
    and as functional food additives. Other applications include detergents, health
    care, pulp and paper, coal, textiles, ceramic processing and food industries excluding
    herbicides and pesticides formulations. This project is eco-friendly and is used
    in cleaning the environment with the help of these microbes
