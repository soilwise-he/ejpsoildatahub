  title: CONTRIBUTION AND STABILITY OF FOREST DERIVED SOIL ORGANIC CARBON DURING WOODY
    ENCROACHMENT IN A TROPICAL SAVANNA. A CASE STUDY IN GABON
  abstract: "This is the pre-print version of the article \"CONTRIBUTION AND STABILITY\
    \ OF FOREST DERIVED SOIL ORGANIC CARBON DURING WOODY ENCROACHMENT IN A TROPICAL\
    \ SAVANNA. A CASE STUDY IN GABON\", published as final paper in Biology and Fertility\
    \ of Soils Volume 54, Issue 8, 1 November 2018, Pages 897-907 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00374-018-1313-6\
    \ <strong>Abstract</strong> In this study, we quantified the contribution of forest-derived\
    \ carbon (FDC) to the soil organic C (SOC) pool along a natural succession from\
    \ savanna (S) to mixed Marantaceae forest (MMF) in the Lop\xE8 National Park,\
    \ Gabon. Four 1-hectare plots, corresponding to different stages along the natural\
    \ succession, were used to determine the SOC stock and soil C isotope composition\
    \ (\U0010004713C) to derive the FDC contribution in different soil layers down\
    \ to 1 m depth. Besides, to investigate changes in SOC stability, we determined\
    \ the 14C concentration of SOC to 30 cm depth and derived turnover time (TT).\
    \ Results indicated that SOC increased only at the end of the succession in the\
    \ MMF stage, which stored 46% more SOC (41 Mg C ha-1) in the 0-30 cm depth than\
    \ the S stage (28.8 Mg C ha-1). The FDC contribution increased along forest succession\
    \ affecting mainly the top layers of the initial successional stages to 15 cm\
    \ depth, and reaching 70 cm depth in the MMF stage. The TT suggests a small increase\
    \ in stability in the 0-5 cm layer from S (146 years) to MMF (157 years) stages.\
    \ Below 5 cm the increase in stability was high, suggesting that FDC can remain\
    \ in soils for a much longer time than savanna derived C. In conclusion, the natural\
    \ succession towards Marantaceae forests can positively impact climate change\
    \ resulting in large SOC stocks, which can be removed from the atmosphere and\
    \ stored for a much longer time in forest soils compared to savanna soils."
