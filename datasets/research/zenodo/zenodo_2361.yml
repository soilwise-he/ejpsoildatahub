    \ The present research work is encouraged by the increasing demand of the data\
    \ belonging to the earthly \u03B3-ray activities into the soil samples of haor\
    \ area of Sunamgonj districts of Bangladesh. For measurements of naturally occurring\
    \ radioactivity and artificial fall out, in the present work a total of 25 soil\
    \ samples were collected from the eleven upazilas of this district. The samples\
    \ were then prepared and irradiated for activity measurements using HPGe detecting\
    \ system. The average concentration of radioactivity in soil samples for <sup>238</sup>U\
    \ is 29.07\xB12.84 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, <sup>232</sup>Th is 26.15\xB12.34 Bq kg<sup>-1\
    \ </sup>and <sup>40</sup>K is 346.33\xB132.66 Bq Kg<sup>-1</sup>, are below the\
    \ world-wide average concentration value. No peak of man-made fission fragment\
    \ <sup>137</sup>Cs (661.66 keV) was observed in the gamma-ray spectrum. The Radium\
    \ Equivalent Activity, Dose Rate, External Hazard Index and Annual Effective Dose\
    \ Equivalent for soil samples in Sunamgonj District has been estimated which are\
    \ also comparable with worldwide average. The natural radioactivity in the present\
    \ study poses no health-hazards to the population there. This study will be helpful\
    \ to provide the possibility to accurately determine the public total effective\
    \ dose rates due to natural radioactivity. <strong>Key word:</strong> Soil sample,\
    \ HPGe detecting system, Activity concentration, Radiological hazards parameters.\
