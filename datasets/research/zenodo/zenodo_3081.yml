  title: 'Soil Loss Estimation and Change of Storage Volume Using GIS and Remote Sensing
    Techniques: A Case of Lom Pangar Hydroelectric Dam Watershed, Cameroon'
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong>: For many purposes of hydropower production,\
    \ many reservoirs are built throughout the planet. Because of the processes of\
    \ erosion and sedimentation, these infrastructures are facing a big problem of\
    \ progressive reduction of their storage capacity. Consequently, a good knowledge\
    \ of the change of storage for proper planning and management is very important.\
    \ The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was used to evaluate the gross erosion\
    \ in the Lom Pangar catchment and the quantity of sediment that effectively reach\
    \ the outlet of the catchment. The gross erosion was evaluated to be 47.2 million\
    \ tons of soil per year with an average of 6.61 million tons per year that effectively\
    \ reach the outlet. On the quantity that reaches the outlet, the Brune\u2019s\
    \ sediment trap efficiency was applied and 0.1% of Lom Pangar reservoir decreases\
    \ per year, an amount smaller than the 1% of annual worldwide reduction of water\
    \ reservoirs. <strong>Keywords: </strong>Erosion, storage volume, reservoir, Lom\
