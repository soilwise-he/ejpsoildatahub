  title: "Soil Remediation Technologies for Heavy Metals \u2013 A Review"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil is a very vital necessity to the ecosystem and human population.
    Due to the urbanization and industrialization, the quality and the fertility of
    soil is deteriorating. This has been a huge concern among countries to discover
    the suitable yet effective solution to remediate the soil as the contaminated
    soil may introduce unhealthy and unsafe environment to society. One of the common
    pollutants in soils are heavy metals and it is very challenging to remediate as
    it is not biodegradable materials. Remediation methods for metals can be classified
    to two categories; in-situ remediation and ex-situ remediation. Studies show that
    chemical remediation the most effective methods used. Chemical remediation and
    biological remediation are also another two available options. Chemical remediation
    methods can be categorized into four; chemical leaching, chemical fixation, electrokinetic
    remediation and vitrify technology. Biological remediation includes phytoremediation,
    bioremediation and the combination of the remediation are one of the most cost
    effective methods that can be implemented especially in poor and middle income
    countries as it involves natures such as plants and animals in the process&lt;/p&gt;'
