  title: Effect of paper mill sludge (furfural) on soil respiration, urease activity
    and ammonia volatilization of calcareous soils
  abstract: "Final paper mill sludge (furfural) is a good material for C Source and\
    \ other nutrients for soil. Incubation tests were done to see how different amounts\
    \ of furfural affected the release of CO2, urease activity and NH3 volatilization\
    \ of two soils (Alzubair and Abul-khasib) collected from Basrah province, south\
    \ of Iraq. Furfural was applied at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 10\
    \ % (w/w) of dried soil. The mentioned parameters were measured at 10, 20 and\
    \ 30 days of incubation time. The furfural rate linearly increased CO2 evolution\
    \ till the concentration of 4 %.\_Increasing furfural concentration beyond 4 %\
    \ did not affect CO2 evolution. In contrast, the urease activity was enhanced\
    \ in the 0-10 % treatments and no clear differences were observed beyond 1.0 %.\
    \ However, the addition of furfural by causes linearly decreased NH3 volatilization\
    \ at all incubation times and in both soils. Control and furfural treatments in\
    \ Abul - khasib soil gave higher CO2 evolution and urease activity and lower NH3\
    \ loss than AL - Zubair loamy sand soil."
