  title: DETERMINATION OF THE SOIL SOUNDING DEPTH FOR THE EARTHING RESISTANCE CALCULATION
    OF SUBSTATIONS 35 KV
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Determination
    of the minimum required sounding depth for calculation of the earthing resistance
    for substations with a voltage class of 35 kV.&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;Methodology.&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;For
    each ratio of electrical resistivity values of soil layers, earthing resistance
    was calculated with changing of the layers separation depth from 0.4 m to h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;,
    where h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;is the layers separation
    depth in a two-layer soil at which the earthing resistance value becomes the same
    as in a uniform soil.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;In the experiments
    carried out, a family of curves was obtained that describes the effect of separation
    depth of soil layers for various combinations of soil electrical resistivities
    and geometric dimensions of the earthing arrangement. The accumulated statistical
    data for substations with a voltage class of 35 kV made it possible to determine
    the required sounding depth depending on the maximum size of the earthing arrangement
    and the probability of the relative resistivity falling into the corresponding
    range of values. An algorithm is proposed for determining the required investigation
    depth by Wenner method as part of the electromagnetic diagnostics of the earthing
    arrangement of existing substations with a voltage class of 35 kV.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Originality.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;For
    the first time, a probabilistic relationship was established between the ratio
    of the electrical resistivity of soil layers, the size of the earthing arrangement,
    and the necessary depth investigation of the geological medium. As a result it
    has been proven that there are substations for which the required sounding depth
    does not exceed the maximum size of the earthing arrangement.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Practical
    value.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The use of the algorithm developed in this work allows
    increasing the accuracy of the earthing resistance calculation of electrical installations
    with voltages above 1 kV operating in a network with isolated neutral.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
