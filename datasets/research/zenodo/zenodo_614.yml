  title: Investigating the Effectiveness of Various Techniques for Soil Improvement
  abstract: 'Existence of unsuitable soil for supporting structures in construction
    sites, lack of space and economic motivations are primary main reasons for using
    soil improvement techniques with poor subgrade soil conditions rather than deep
    foundation. Soil at a construction site may not always be totally suitable for
    supporting structures in its natural state. In such a case, the soil needs to
    be improved to increase its bearing capacity and decrease the expected settlement.
    This topic gives an overview of techniques that are commonly used to improve the
    performance, reduce the post construction settlement, and enhance the shear strength
    of the soil system, increase the bearing capacity of the soil, and improve the
    stability of dams and embankments. Then, this study concluded that there is an
    urgent need to study the technique of removal and replacement for improving soil
    behavior taking into consideration geotechnical requirements (i.e. bearing capacity
    and settlement) and cost to achieve the optimum thickness of replacement layers
    and the most suitable material corresponding to minimum total cost of foundation
    works.
