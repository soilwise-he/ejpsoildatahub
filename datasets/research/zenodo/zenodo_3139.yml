  title: Organic Matter and Chromium Evolution in Herbage and Soil in a Pinus radiata
    Silvopastoral System in Northwest Spain after Sewage Sludge and Lime Application
  abstract: 'This article aims to compare the effects of applying three doses of sewage
    sludge, with

    or without liming, on organic matter, total and available chromium (Cr), and their
    concentration

    in plants. Unfertilized (NF) and mineral treatments were used as control. Soil

    organic-matter (SOM) modification depended on the interaction of liming and sewage

    sludge implementation. Liming, high sludge doses, and mineral treatment caused
    less

    SOM in the second year of study. However, after 3 years, SOM was increased by
    both

    mineral and sludge fertilizers compared to NF treatments as result of tree development

    and the reduction of organic-matter mineralization into the soil. These findings

    could have important implications for soil carbon storage capacity. Total Cr in
    soil and

    forage was increased by sewage sludge application compared to mineral or NF treatments.

    Liming increased Cr availability in the spring of 2000, where sewage sludge was

    applied, and reduced Fe availability.'
