  title: Regenerative Agriculture Practices Influences Productivity, Soil Carbon Dynamics
    and GHG Emissions in Rice-based Cropping Systems
  abstract: The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is characterized by high population density,
    limited arable land, and intensive agriculture practices, posing risks to food
    security and environmental stability. The study was conducted over three years,
    encompassing different regenerative agriculture practices. The main plots (Conventional
    Farming (CF-rice-wheat; no residues) and Regenerative Farming (RF-rice-wheat-mungbean;
    50% rice residue)) and sub-plot (State Fertilizer Recommendation (SRF) and Site-Specific
    Nutrient Management (SSNM)). The subplot was divided into Bio-input (25% reductions
    in NPK dose) and without Bio-input. The trial was replicated three times in a
    split-plot design. In Kharif/wet-season, Moti rice variety; in Rabi/dry and winter-season,
    PBW-343 wheat variety, and Jayad/summer-season, Virat mungbean variety were used.
    The productivity parameters included rice grain yield, biomass production, and
    nutrient use efficiency. Soil carbon dynamics were evaluated by measuring different
    organic carbon fractions and soil respiration rates. GHG emissions were estimated
    through the MOT tool developed by the CCAFS program. Adopting RA practices increased
    rice and wheat grain yield by 2.67% and 10.4% compared to the conventional system.
    The system yield increased by 29.0% across the treatments after 3 years of study.
    Biomass production also showed a similar trend, with regenerative practices leading
    to higher biomass accumulation. Moreover, nutrient use efficiency improved under
    both practices where the SSNM principle was followed, indicating better crop nutrient
    utilization. Such increment might be due to a conducive rhizospheric micro-climate
    for nutrient uptake and mobility. Soil organic carbon content in the topsoil (0-15
    cm) increased by 4.10% in the regenerative systems (5.10 mg/kg) compared to the
    conventional system (4.90 mg/kg). This increase in soil carbon can contribute
    to maintaining soil fertility, moisture retention, and climate change mitigation.
    Additionally, soil respiration rates were lower in the regenerative systems, suggesting
    improved soil health and reduced carbon losses. Due to improved management practices,
    emissions were significantly reduced by 8.43% and 32.7% in rice and wheat in the
    regenerative compared to the conventional systems. Further research and promotion
    of regenerative agriculture at the policy and farm level are warranted to facilitate
    adoption and realize the potentials of these practices for agricultural development.
