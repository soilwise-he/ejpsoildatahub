  title: Remediation of Petroleum Refinery Waste Contaminated Soil at Alesa-Eleme,
    River State
  abstract: "Soil contamination by hydrocarbons and trace metals has led to adverse\
    \ environmental and ecological impacts globally. As with the case in most third-world\
    \ countries like Nigeria, where legal and illegal oil refineries do not follow\
    \ or implement the national policies and guidelines for the treatment of industrial\
    \ waste products before these waste products are disposed of into the environment.\
    \ In this study, petroleum wastes contaminated soil at Alesa, Eleme resulting\
    \ from the different production processes of petroleum products, was investigated\
    \ to know the extent of contamination by heavy metals such as Iron (Fe), Zinc\
    \ (Zn), Lead (Pb), Sulphates (SO4), Phosphates (PO4) and organic hydrocarbons\
    \ like Phenols which are very dangerous to the environment and how they can be\
    \ remediated by chemical and biological remediation methods and finding out which\
    \ method is more cost-effective and environmentally friendly and sustainable.\
    \ The extent of contamination of the soil was determined by the collection of\
    \ soil samples from randomized sample points with coordinates 290223.14N 527592.55E,\
    \ 290260.98N 527694.41E and 290326.19N 527622.51E at the affected area using a\
    \ Standard Soil Auger at a depth of 15 \u2013 30 cm (subsoil), the soil was then\
    \ pretreated and their physiochemical properties were determined and later analyzed\
    \ for the presence of heavy metals under a laboratory controlled experiment. High\
    \ concentrations of heavy metals and hydrocarbons were found to be present in\
    \ the soil from the affected area, this could also be seen in a common dominant\
    \ shrub locally known as stubborn grass (Sida acuta) which was also analyzed for\
    \ the presence of heavy metals. Chemical remediation (using EDTA/Oxalic acid)\
    \ and biological remediation methods (phytoremediation) using Sunflower (Helianthus\
    \ annus) were carried out to treat the contaminated soil and the rate of removal\
    \ of contaminants through phytoremediation was calculated at 6 weeks and 9 weeks\
    \ intervals to know the extent to which the contaminants were removed from the\
    \ soil. The remediation methods were proofed to be very effective. The results\
    \ of one-way analysis of variance of the contaminated soil at 6 weeks and 9 weeks\
    \ during the phytoremediation process were 3.014 and 49.2 respectively and this\
    \ revealed that there was a significant difference between the concentrations\
    \ of contaminants with an F value of 0.575 which is greater than the F-Critical\
    \ value for the alpha level selected (0.05). It was recommended that the Government\u2019\
    s Ministry of Environment at all levels, should adopt and enforce sound waste\
    \ management practices for refinery wastes and phytoremediation should be considered\
    \ in reviving soil contaminated by refinery waste."
