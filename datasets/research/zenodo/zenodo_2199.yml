  title: Assessment of Soil, Water and Vegetable Crops for Zinc Deficiency in Gadap
    Basin for Agricultural Solution
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract: </strong>Present study aimed to examine the impact\
    \ of physico-chemical factors of agricultural soil on zinc availability for plant\
    \ uptake in the Gadap Basin. Bio accessibility and availability were assessed\
    \ for the vegetable and fruit plants. For this purpose, water (n = 6), soil (n=11),\
    \ and plant (n=12) samples were collected from agricultural-fields. Data revealed\
    \ that both water (Range: 7.14 to 8.34; mean: of 7.99) and soil (Range: 7.8 to\
    \ 8.4) pH is alkaline. The soil Eh is oxic which span between +120 and+134 mV.\
    \ Similarly, High soil salinity (Range: 163 to 322 mg/kg) is causing increasing\
    \ soil pH, which is leading to less availability of zinc to plants. According\
    \ to soil classification, soil of Gadap is found to be coarse grained where 85%\
    \ of the soil retained between 60 and 100 meshes, while 5% stayed between 17 and\
    \ 200 meshes, and other 10% comprises clay. The zinc concentration in soil ranged\
    \ between 25\u201340 mg/kg, which is extremely low. On the other, hand zn concentration\
    \ in plant samples is found to be 10.71mg/Kg-21.35mg/Kg. It is concluded that\
    \ agricultural soil of Gadap town is deficient in Zn content which is affecting\
    \ the crops nutrient index. \xA9 International Journal of Ground Sediment &amp;\
