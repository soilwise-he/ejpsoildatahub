  title: Diffusion of Water in Soil under a Temperature Gradient
  abstract: "Chemistry Department, Presidency College, Calcutta-700 073. Department\
    \ of Applied Chemistry, University of Calcutta, Calcutta-700 009. A pheuomenological\
    \ description of the process of thermal diffusion has been given. Diffusion equations\
    \ have been developed from the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, and expressions\
    \ for fundamental quantities U.ke the entropy\xB7 production and the dissipation\
    \ function for a non-isothermal system have been derived from the first principles.\
    \ These various rate equations have been shown to yield for isothermal conditions\
    \ different forms of Darcy's law for flow of soil\xB7 water under varying degrees\
    \ of saturation. The concept of heat of transport is also introduced, and its\
    \ relevance in relation to soil-water interactions discussed. These various derivations\
    \ have been followed by a short review of work done thus far to investigate thermal\
    \ ditfusion or water (both in the liquid and the vapour phases) in soil by different\
    \ workers."
