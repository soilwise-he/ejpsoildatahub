  title: Modelling of Circular Footing on Lateritic Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This work modelled circular footing on lateritic soil. This
    was done by studying the relationship between bearing capacity of circular footing
    and fines content of lateritic soil. Lateritic soil samples were collected and
    subjected to laboratory tests, including tests leading to the determination of
    bearing capacity using circular footing . Bearing capacity was determined for
    the natural soil samples. The samples were separated into fines and coarse components
    and later remoulded in varying proportions of fines coarse content, from 0 100
    in 10 increments. Bearing capacity was computed for all the remoulded soil samples.
    Regression analysis was then used to determine the relationship between the bearing
    capacity of circular footing and fines content of the soil. The model was found
    to be valid for the selected locations. G. O. Adunoye | O. A. Agbede &quot;Modelling
