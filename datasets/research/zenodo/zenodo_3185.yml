  title: 'Urban Living Labs, Circular Economy and Nature-Based Solutions: Ideation
    and Testing of a New Soil in the City of Turin Using a Multi-stakeholder Perspective'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the attempt to foster circular economy (CE), cities are increasingly
    adopting urban living labs (ULLs) as sites of co-production aimed at testing alternative
    solutions based on the reuse of products, reduction of consumption and recycling
    of materials. Taking this perspective, our study adopts an exploratory research
    design to discover the pragmatic implications emerging from a case study. The
    City of Turin joined proGIreg, a European project that entails the regeneration
    of former industrial districts by means of nature-based solutions (NBS). Ranging
    from aquaponics to green roofs, seven NBS have been experimented in Turin, which
    rely on the use of natural systems to tackle social, economic and environmental
    challenges efficiently and sustainably. Among them, the most promising is related
    to the production and test of the &lsquo;&lt;em&gt;new soil&lt;/em&gt;&rsquo;,
    a blend obtained by mixing earth materials coming from construction sites with
    compost, zeolites and mycorrhizae. The case herein presented is interesting to
    analyse for the multi-stakeholder management setting used, where public institutions,
    private companies, research institutions, citizens and associations collaborated
    in the co-creation and testing phase of the NBS. Consequently, the data collected
    through participant observation and direct interviews allow researchers to describe
    multi-stakeholders&rsquo; dynamics and how they work. Thus, this paper narrates
    a micro-contextual experience while providing a critique. Results include an analysis
    of the unique combination of different stakeholders, which strongly impacted on
    the management and the effectiveness of the entire project. By consequence, the
    paper offers both theoretical contributions to the relational branch of stakeholder
    theory and practical evidence in demonstrating the importance of the relational
    branch of the theory over a more traditional transactional view.&lt;/p&gt;'
