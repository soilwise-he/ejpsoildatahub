  title: Development of a method for obtaining sorbent from bagasse of sweet sorghum
    for neutralization of soil contamination by heavy metal ions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The object of research is the industrial waste of
    plant raw materials of sweet sorghum (lignocellulosic bagasse) and a modified
    sorbent created on its basis for cleaning soils contaminated with heavy metal
    ions. Traditionally, the modification of plant materials to obtain sorbents involves
    the oxidation (hydrolysis) of plant material under the action of strong mineral
    acids at high temperature. After acid treatment, alkaline activation and repeated
    washing of the sorbent is carried out until neutral wash water. The yield of the
    sorbent is 20&ndash;30 % by weight of raw materials. In addition, a significant
    amount of decomposition products and large volumes of hazardous wastewater are
    generated. Therefore in the course of the study, a mercerization method was used
    to obtain a sorbent &ndash; treating lignocellulosic bagasse with an alkali solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main components of lignocellulosic bagasse are lignin and
    cellulose, connected in biopolymer complexes. In their raw form, they have weak
    sorption properties through the fibrillary structure and low content of free functional
    groups in them. Under the conditions of the mercerization process, the molecular
    bonds between the fibers of the biopolymers are partially destroyed and the solution
    of low molecular weight polysaccharides is dissolved. The structural framework
    of the lignocellulosic matrix is preserved, and its ability to swell is growing.
    Integrity is preserved, vegetable fibers improve their structural-porous structure
    by increasing the internal adsorption surface. The optimal conditions for the
    mercerization process are a hydro module of 1:10 with an initial alkali concentration
    of 120 g/l. The maximum sorption values of heavy metal ions increase by a factor
    of 2&ndash;3. The sorbent yield reaches 60&ndash;80 %. In addition, the advantage
    of this method is the absence of harmful wastewater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The developed method can be used for processing waste and other
    plant materials (corn, sunflower, sugar cane, etc.), and the resulting sorbent
    is used in agricultural technologies for neutralization of soils contaminated
    with heavy metal ions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
