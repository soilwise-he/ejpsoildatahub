  title: Numerical Investigations on Group Piles' Lateral Bearing Capacity Considering
    Interaction of Soil and Structure
  abstract: In this research, the behavior of monopiles, under lateral loads, was
    investigated with vertical and oblique piles by Finite Element Method. In engineering
    practice when soil-pile interaction comes to the picture some simplifications
    are applied to reduce the design time. As a simplified replacement of soil and
    pile interaction analysis, pile could be replaced by a column. The height of the
    column would be equal to the free length of the pile plus a portion of the embedded
    length of it. One of the important factors studied in this study was that columns
    with an equivalent length (free length plus a part of buried depth) could be used
    instead of soil and pile modeling. The results of the analysis show that the more
    internal friction angle of the soil increases, the more the bearing capacity of
    the soil is achieved. This additional length is 6 to 11 times of the pile diameter
    in dense soil although in loose sandy soil this range might increase.
