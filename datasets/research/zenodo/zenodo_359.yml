  title: Resin as a Soil Stabilizer - A Review
  abstract: Soil is the most important construction material which is the support
    of any structure, no matter what is the function the structure plays. But the
    problem is that the soil may be a little tricky and the properties may not be
    suitable for construction. To make the soil suitable for use, should be replaced
    or treated mechanically or chemically. Better to do treating than replacing. Most
    suitable among the treatment is use of additives for better bonding. Among the
    additives most suitable are polymers such as resins. There are many studies carried
    to find the effect of adding various resins on various types of soils. Most of
    the studies shows good improvement of soil properties. i.e., resin can be used
    as better stabilizing agent.
