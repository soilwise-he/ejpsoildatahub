  title: Electroremediation Of Cu-Contaminated Soil
  abstract: This study investigated the removal efficiency of electrokinetic remediation
    of copper-contaminated soil at different combinations of enhancement reagents
    used as anolyte and catholyte. Sodium hydroxide (at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M concentrations)
    and distilled water were used as anolyte, while lactic acid (at 0.01, 0.1, and
    0.5 M concentrations), ammonium citrate (also at 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 M concentrations)
    and distilled water were used as catholyte. A continuous voltage application (1.0
    VDC/cm) was employed for 240 hours for each experiment. The copper content of
    the catholyte was determined at the end of the 240-hour period. Optimization was
    carried out with a Response Surface Methodology - Optimal Design, including F
    test, and multiple comparison method, to determine which pair of anolyte-catholyte
    was the most significant for the removal efficiency. "1.0 M NaOH" was found to
    be the most significant anolyte while it was established that lactic acid was
    the most significant type of catholyte to be used for the most successful electrokinetic
    experiments. Concentrations of lactic acid should be at the range of 0.1 M to
    0.5 M to achieve maximum percent removal values.
