  title: Behaviour of Undrained Cohesion in Fly Ash  Stabilized Lateritic Soil
  abstract: 'An investigation of the behaviour of undrained cohesion in fly ash stabilized
    lateritic soil was carried out with respect to the strength of the lateritic soil.
    This study looks into the possibility of using fly ash to enhance the strength
    of lateritic soils for construction purposes. The soil samples were obtained from
    three (3) boreholes (BH1-BH3) at different locations at a depth of 1.0, 1.5 and
    2.0 meters each. Several preliminary laboratory tests, including specific gravity,
    moisture content, bulk density, Atterberg limit, particle size analysis and triaxial
    tests were carried out first to characterize the lateritic soil. The stabilization
    process was carried out with varying percentages of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%
    fly ash by weight of the lateritic soil to determine the undrained cohesion and
    shear strength of the modified lateritic soil through triaxial test. The result
    showed an increase in the undrained cohesion and shear strength for the three
    (3) boreholes at the various depths respectively upon adding fly ash up until
    15%, after which further increase in fly ash caused a decrease in the undrained
    cohesion and strength. However, it was discovered that 15% fly ash gave the optimum
    undrained cohesion and shear strength of the modified soil. This study will help
    the construction sector utilize fly ash more effectively for stability, economic
    and environmental benefits.
