  title: Influence Of Garbage Leachate On Soil Reaction,Salinity And Soil Organic
    Matter In East Of Isfahan
  abstract: 'During this day a considerable amount of Leachate is produced with high
    amounts of organic material and nutrients needed plants. This study has done in
    order to scrutinize the effect of Leachate compost on the pH, EC and organic matter
    percentage in the form of statistical Factorial plan through randomizing block
    design with three main and two minor treatments and also three replications during
    three six month periods. Major treatments include N: Irrigation with the region-s
    well water as a control, I: Frequent irrigation with well water and Leachate,
    C: Mixing Leachate and water well (25 percent leachate + 75 percent ordinary well
    water) and secondary treatments, include DI: surface drip irrigation and SDI:
    sub surface drip irrigation. Results of this study indicated significant differences
    between treatments and also there were mixing up with the control treatment in
    the reduction of pH, increasing soluble salts and also increasing the organic
    matter percentage. This increase is proportional to the amount of added Leachate
    and in the treatment also proportional to higher mixture of frequent treatment.
    Therefore, since creating an acidic pH increases the ability to absorb some nutrient
    elements such as phosphorus, iron, zinc, copper and manganese are increased and
    the other hand, organic materials also improve many physical and chemical properties
    of soil are used in Leachate trash Consider health issues as refined in the green
    belts around cities as a liquid fertilizer recommended.'
