  title: Estimation of Soil Loss and Ranking Priority in Implementing Soil Erosion
    Control Measures in Sebeya Catchment, Rwanda
  abstract: <em>Soil erosion is one of the major environmental issues causing the
    loss of topsoil and fertility in agricultural land. Western part of Rwanda including
    Sebeya catchment has high susceptibility to erosion leading to huge amounts of
    soil loss and river sedimentation. The present study held to estimate the actual
    soil loss from Sebeya catchment and its 8 sub-catchments. ArcGIS software was
    used to delineate the catchment and its sub-catchments and for mapping all USLE
    factors. By integrating all maps of USLE factors in GIS, the average soil loss
    from the whole catchment area was estimated to 130.724<strong> </strong>t/ha/yr.
    Kanzenze sub-catchment was found to be the 1<sup>st</sup> sub-catchment alarming
    the intervention with a soil loss of 243.868 t/ha/yr while Bitenga sub-catchment
    appears at the last rank with a soil loss of 86.922 t/ha/yr for this prioritization
    in implementing soil erosion control measures. Therefore, the unevenly spatial
    distribution of soil erosion rates in this study should help the agricultural
    managers to improve their strategy in planning and implementing the soil erosion
    control measures in Sebeya catchment.</em>
