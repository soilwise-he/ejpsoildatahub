  title: Spatial Scaling of Soil Moisture, Evapotranspiration, and Leakage
  abstract: "An outstanding issue in ecohydrological modeling is scaling nonlinear\
    \ plant-level \ninteractions among soil, vegetation, and water to larger spatial\
    \ scales.  Spatial \nheterogeneity in precipitation and vegetation exert significant\
    \ control on scaling \nproperties, especially in water-limited ecosystems.  Computational\
    \ results indicate \nthat relationships between spatially averaged variables controlling\
    \ soil-moisture \ndynamics are non-unique at larger averaging scales, even when\
    \ unique, non-hysteretic \nrelationships are defined at the plant level.  The\
    \ complexity of these relationships \nevolves with increasing averaging area based\
    \ on the characteristics of the spatial \nheterogeneity.  Through detail simulation\
    \ studies, we can identify a threshold scale \nfor soil moisture, evapotranspiration,\
    \ and leakage beyond which the non-unique \nrelationships will vary only slowly\
    \ as averaging area becomes larger.  The threshold \nscale, which is analogous\
    \ to the concept of a representative elementary area, \nenables identification\
    \ of a large-scale relationship that is meaningful with respect \nto the characteristics\
    \ of the system.\n\nWe use numerical simulations to assess the effects of storm\
    \ spatial structure, \nrainfall intensity and frequency, and soil and vegetation\
    \ characteristics on \nthreshold-scale values of the relevant variables.  Results\
    \ are generalized by \nrelating the threshold scales to a dimensionless group\
    \ of parameters that includes \nlength scales characteristic of the heterogeneity\
    \ and the model's resolution.  We \nthen evaluate how the computationally derived\
    \ non-unique relationships relate to \nanalytical approaches to obtain spatially\
    \ averaged functional relationships.  \nSpecific comparison of empirically obtained\
    \ upscaled functions (based on the non-\nunique relationships) with the so-called\
    \ statistical dynamic approach provides \nguidelines to account for spatial heterogeneity\
    \ in soil, plant, and climate systems."
