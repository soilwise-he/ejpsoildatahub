  title: Studies on the Transformation of Iron Phosphates in Buffer and Acid Soil
    Systems
  abstract: Vivekananda College, Calcutta and Barasat Govt. College, Barasat, 24-Parganas
    <em>Manuscript received 22 February 1977, accepted 9 January 1980</em> Chemical
    transformation of different iron phosphates in contact with buffer and acid soils
    systems at different <em>p</em>Hs<em> </em>4.8, 5.2, 5.8 and 6.2 were studied.
    The results indicate that these iron phosphates undergo hydrolysis reactions and
    basic (hydroxy) phosphates were ultimately converted to FePO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O.
    Such transformation were effected by different probable chemical reactions.
