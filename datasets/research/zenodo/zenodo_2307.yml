  title: THE PROBLEM OF SOIL POLLUTION AND DEGRADATION ON THE TERRITORY OF BELARUS
    FOR THE PERIOD 2015-2016
  abstract: The problem of land degradation due to various anthropogenic factors was
    studied, as a result of the study, the causes of land degradation in Belarus were
    identified and their impact on human health was studied. The soils of the surveyed
    settlements are characterized by exceeding the values of background concentrations
    for all identified ingredients, which confirms the accumulation of man-made pollutants
    in the upper layer of urban soils, and there has also been a deterioration in
    the agrophysical state of soils due to erosion and reclamation.
