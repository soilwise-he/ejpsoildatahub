  title: 'Simplex Lattice Design and X-ray Diffraction for Analysis of Soil Structure:
    A Case of Cement-Stabilised Compacted Tills Reinforced with Steel Slag and Slaked
    Lime'
  abstract: "Evaluating the structure of soil prior to building construction is valuable\
    \ in a large variety of geotechnical and civil engineering applications. To built\
    \ an effective framework for assessing the strength of the stabilised soil, the\
    \ presented workflow includes a complex approach of simplex lattice design and\
    \ X-ray diffraction for the analysis of soil structure. Different from the traditional\
    \ in situ measurements, we propose a statistical framework for effective decision-making\
    \ on binder combination to stabilise soil collected in three localities of Southern\
    \ Sweden\u2014Brom\xF6lla Municipality (Sk\xE5ne County), Petersborg (\xD6sterg\xF6\
    tland County) and \xD6rebro (\xD6rebro County). A practical solution is presented\
    \ that includes the evaluation of strength properties of various types of soil\
    \ using ordinary Portland cement (OPC), slaked lime and steel slag as pure agents\
    \ and blended binders. The specimens were collected in Southern Sweden and included\
    \ sandy silty tills and clay till (clay content 6\u201318%). The preprocessing\
    \ included the mineralogical analysis of mineral composition and soil structure\
    \ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a sieve. The soil samples were fabricated, compacted,\
    \ rammed, stabilised by six binder blends and assessed for uniaxial compressive\
    \ strength (UCS). The moisture condition value (MCV) and water content tests were\
    \ done for compacted soil and showed variation in the MCV values for different\
    \ binders. The study determined the effects from binder blends on the UCS gain\
    \ in three types of soil, measured on days 7, 28 and 90. Positive effects were\
    \ noted from the steel slag/lime blends on the UCS gain in sandy silty tills.\
    \ A steel slag/slaked lime mixed binder performed better compared to the pure\
    \ binders. The effectiveness of the simplex lattice design was demonstrated in\
    \ a series of ternary diagrams showing soil strength evaluated by adding the stabilising\
    \ agents in different proportions."
