  title: Effect Of High Lost On Ignition (Loi) Content Cement Kiln Dust On The Index
    Properties Of Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: The preliminary investigation carried out on a black cotton soil shows
    that it falls under A-7-6 (16) using AASHTO classification and CL according to
    Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The tests carried out on the cement
    kiln dust treated soil showed that the liquid limit of the natural soil increased
    from 48.2% to a peak value of 51.8% at 2% CKD treatment and thereafter decreased
    with higher CKD content. The plastic limit also increased from 27.2% for the natural
    soil to a peak value of 36.8% at 4% CKD treatment. The plasticity index value,
    decreases from 21.0% for the natural soil to a minimum value of 12.8% at 6% CKD
    content. The maximum dry density (MDD) for British Standard Light (BSL) and British
    Standard Heavy (BSH) compactive efforts increased to peak values of 1.66 and 1.91
    Mg/m3 at 6% and 4% CKD contents respectively. The MDD for West African Standard
    (WAS) compactive effort increased with higher CKD content. The Optimum Moisture
    Content (OMC) for BSL and BSH compactive efforts increased up to 6%CKD content
    then decreased with higher CKD content. For the WAS compactive effort, the OMC
    generally decreased with higher CKD content.
