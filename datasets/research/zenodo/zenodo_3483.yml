  title: Phytopathology Prediction In Dry Soil Using Artificial Neural Networks Modeling
  abstract: The rapid expansion of deserts in recent decades as a result of human
    actions combined with climatic changes has highlighted the necessity to understand
    biological processes in arid environments. Whereas physical processes and the
    biology of flora and fauna have been relatively well studied in marginally used
    arid areas, knowledge of desert soil micro-organisms remains fragmentary. The
    objective of this study is to conduct a diversity analysis of bacterial communities
    in unvegetated arid soils. Several biological phenomena in hot deserts related
    to microbial populations and the potential use of micro-organisms for restoring
    hot desert environments. Dry land ecosystems have a highly heterogeneous distribution
    of resources, with greater nutrient concentrations and microbial densities occurring
    in vegetated than in bare soils. In this work, we found it useful to use techniques
    of artificial intelligence in their treatment especially artificial neural networks
    (ANN). The use of the ANN model, demonstrate his capability for addressing the
    complex problems of uncertainty data.
