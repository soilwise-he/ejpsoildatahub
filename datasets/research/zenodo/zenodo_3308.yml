  title: Soil Quality Assessment in Dehradun District
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil harbours mixture of various organic and inorganic nutrients
    which supports the land plants but&lt;br&gt;

    the multifarious activities of human pollutes it. The physicochemical study of
    soil parameters is important for&lt;br&gt;

    plant growth and soil management. The present work is thus attempted to evaluate
    physico chemical parameters&lt;br&gt;

    of soil samples to assess its quality. Four representative samples in triplicate
    were obtained and analyzed for&lt;br&gt;

    its colour, texture, moisture content, organic carbon content, TDS, pH, EC, Ca+2,
    Mg+2, Cl-. Results show that&lt;br&gt;

    most of soils were little alkaline having pH ranged from 7.6-8.1 except site 2
    where pH 5.1 was observed. The&lt;br&gt;

    value of electrical conductivity ranged between 0.30-0.73 &mu;.S/cm indicating
    the normal nature of soil. Moreover,&lt;br&gt;

    the soils were having organic carbon ranging between 0.31%-0.80%. The Ca+2, Mg+2
    content ranged between&lt;br&gt;

    35.3-66.3mg/l while Cl- ranged between 30.1-38.3 mg/l. This information will be
    beneficial for environmentalists&lt;br&gt;

    to assess the factors responsible for the variation of soil parameters in different
    sites and to the farmers to&lt;br&gt;

    evaluate the fertility and nutrient status of the soil for precise farming and
    agricultural management&lt;/p&gt;'
