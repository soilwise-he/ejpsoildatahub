  title: Comparison of Biosurfactants Yield Produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens Strain
    PC20 Isolated from Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soil using Different Agricultural
    Waste
  abstract: 'Biosurfactants are amphipathic compounds produced extracellularly by
    microorganisms on cell surfaces, or excreted extracellularly. They contain hydrophilic
    and hydrophobic moieties that reduce surface and interfacial tension between molecules
    at the surface and interface respectively. The present study focused on isolation,
    screening, identification of biosurfactant producing bacteria and also development
    of economical methods for biosurfactant production by the use of unconventional
    substrates. The research investigated the potential of utilizing agro industrial
    (Pineapple and cassava) wastes to replace synthetic media for biosurfactant production.
    Eighteen isolates obtained were screened for biosurfactant activity using Emulsification
    Index, haemolysis and oil displacement method. The bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens
    Strain PC20 isolated was able to grow and produce biosurfactant 10ml and 5ml per
    200ml of cassava and pineapple peel respectively.Read Complete Article at ijSciences:
