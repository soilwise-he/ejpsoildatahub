  title: Nitrogen fixation in biological soil crusts from southeast Utah, USA
  abstract: 'Biological soil crusts can be the dominant source of N for arid land
    ecosystems. We measured potential N fixation rates biweekly for 2 years, using
    three types of soil crusts: (1) crusts whose directly counted cells were &gt;98%
    Microcoleus vaginatus (light crusts); (2) crusts dominated by M. vaginatus, but
    with 20% or more of the directly counted cells represented by Nostoc commune and
    Scytonema myochrous (dark crusts); and (3) the soil lichen Collema sp. At all
    observation times, Collema had higher nitrogenase activity (NA) than dark crusts,
    which had higher NA than light crusts, indicating that species composition is
    critical when estimating N inputs. In addition, all three types of crusts generally
    responded in a similar fashion to climate conditions. Without precipitation within
    a week of collection, no NA was recorded, regardless of other conditions being
    favorable. Low (&lt;1C) and high (&gt;26C) temperatures precluded NA, even if
    soils were moist. If rain or snow melt had occurred 3 or less days before collection,
    NA levels were highly correlated with daily average temperatures of the previous
    3 days (r2=0.93 for Collema crusts; r2=0.86 for dark crusts and r2=0.83 for light
    crusts) for temperatures between 1C and 26C. If a precipitation event followed
    a long dry period, NA levels were lower than if collection followed a time when
    soils were wet for extended periods (e.g., winter). Using a combination of data
    from a recording weather datalogger, time-domain reflectometry, manual dry-down
    curves, and N fixation rates at different temperatures, annual N input from the
    different crust types was estimated. Annual N input from dark crusts found at
    relatively undisturbed sites was estimated at 9 kg ha-1 year-1. With 20% cover
    of the N-fixing soil lichen Collema, inputs are estimated at 13 kg ha-1 year-1.
    N input from light crusts, generally indicating soil surface disturbance, was
    estimated at 1.4 kg ha-1 year-1. The rates in light crusts are expected to be
    highly variable, as disturbance history will determine cyanobacterial biomass
    and therefore N fixation rates.'
