  title: Rapid Determination of Soil Class Based on Visible-Near Infrared, Mid-Infrared
    Spectroscopy and Data Fusion
  abstract: Wise soil management requires detailed soil information, but conventional
    soil class mapping in a rather coarse spatial resolution cannot meet the demand
    for precision agriculture. With the advantages of non-destructiveness, rapid cost-efficiency,
    and labor savings, the spectroscopic technique has proved its high potential for
    success in soil classification. Previous studies mainly focused on predicting
    soil classes using a single sensor. In this study, we attempted to compare the
    predictive ability of visible near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra, mid-infrared (MIR)
    spectra, and their fused spectra for soil classification. A total of 146 soil
    profiles were collected from Zhejiang, China, and the soil properties and spectra
    were measured by their genetic horizons. Along with easy-to-measure auxiliary
    soil information (soil organic matter, soil texture, color and pH), four spectral
    data, including vis-NIR, MIR, their simple combination (vis-NIR-MIR), and outer
    product analysis (OPA) fused spectra, were used for soil classification using
    a multiple objectives mixed support vector machine model. The independent validation
    results showed that the classification model using MIR (accuracy of 64.5%) was
    slightly better than that using vis-NIR (accuracy of 64.2%). The predictive model
    built on vis-NIR-MIR did not improve the classification accuracy, having the lowest
    accuracy of 61.1%, which likely resulted from an over-fitting problem. The model
    based on OPA fused spectra performed best with an accuracy of 68.4%. Our results
    prove the potential of fusing vis-NIR and MIR using OPA for improving prediction
    ability for soil classification.
