  title: PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF EMPTY FRUIT BUNCHES (EFB) AND PALM OIL MILL
    EFFLUENTS (POME) FOR COMPOSTING FOR SOIL IMPROVEMENT
  abstract: "Empty fruit bunches (EFB) and palm oil mill Effluents (POME), are currently\
    \ been poorly utilized and dumped with no regards for the environment. Cameroon\
    \ has a vast potential in biomass production, resultant from its many agro-industries,\
    \ and presently, very little to no valorization strategy is in place for the possible\
    \ reduction of industrial wastes, thereby leading to environmental pollution.\
    \ The aim of this research was to characterize EFB and POME for valorization as\
    \ manure compose. The EFB were chopped with a machete into tiny pieces while the\
    \ POME was cooled and bottled in amber-colored bottles prior to physicochemical\
    \ analyses which were carried out at HYDRAC, IRAD and CBC-HS, respectively. The\
    \ EFB contained 0.35%; 0.12%; 0.5%; 0.7% of Nitrogen, potassium, Magnesium and\
    \ Calcium, respectively. For the POME, temperature, pH, TS, TVS, TSS, BOD and\
    \ COD were of 27.9\xB0c, 4.87, 22.100mg/l, 1.400mg/l, 9.022mg/l, 1.260mg/l and\
    \ 7,960mg/l, respectively. Based on the results, the physicochemical properties\
    \ of TVS, TSS, BOD and COD in POME exceeded the stipulated amounts to be deposited\
    \ into the environment without prior treatment. This therefore implies that the\
    \ sustainable use of these vital agricultural by-products as manure in the agricultural\
    \ sector will necessitate prior treatment in order to prevent pollution."
