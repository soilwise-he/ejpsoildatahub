  title: 'Phosphorus and soil development: Does the Walker and Syers model apply to
    semiarid ecosystems?'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The Walker and Syers model of phosphorus (P) transformations\
    \ during pedogenesis is widely accepted for the development of humid ecosystems,\
    \ but long-term P dynamics of more arid ecosystems remain poorly understood. We\
    \ tested the Walker and Syers model in semiarid pi\xF1on\u2013juniper woodlands\
    \ by measuring soil P fractions under tree canopies and in intercanopy spaces\
    \ along a well-constrained, \u223C3000 ka (1 ka = 1000 years) volcanic substrate\
    \ age gradient in northern Arizona, USA. The various pools of soil P behaved largely\
    \ as predicted; total soil P and primary mineral P declined consistently with\
    \ substrate age, labile inorganic P increased early in soil development and then\
    \ declined at later stages, and organic phosphorus increased consistently across\
    \ the chronosequence. Within each site, soils under tree canopies tended to have\
    \ higher concentrations of labile and intermediately available P fractions compared\
    \ to intercanopy soils. However, the degree of spatial heterogeneity conferred\
    \ by tree islands was moderated by the stage of soil development. In contrast,\
    \ tree islands had no influence on within-site distribution of more recalcitrant\
    \ soil P pools, which appear to be controlled solely by the stage of pedogenesis.\
    \ Coincident with declines in total P, primary mineral P, and labile inorganic\
    \ P, we found that phosphatase enzyme activity increased with substrate age; a\
    \ result consistent with greater ecosystem-level P demand on older, more highly\
    \ weathered substrates. Our results suggest that, compared to humid climates,\
    \ reduced inputs of water, energy, and acidity to semiarid ecosystems slow the\
    \ rate of change in P fractions during pedogenesis, but the overall pattern remains\
    \ consistent with the Walker and Syers model. Furthermore, our data imply that\
    \ pedogenic change may be an important factor controlling the spatial distribution\
    \ of labile P pools in semiarid ecosystems. Taken together, these data should\
    \ both broaden and unify terrestrial ecosystem development theory.&lt;/p&gt;"
