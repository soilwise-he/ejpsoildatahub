  title: Microplastic pollution of organic waste products used for soil amendment
  abstract: "The latest literature suggests that organic fertilizers are one of the\
    \ first sources of contamination of agricultural soils. Indeed, organic materials\
    \ for intended soil amendments (e.g. composts, green waste, manure, sewage sludge)\
    \ are the result of various processes and can be contaminated by microplastics\
    \ (MP), such as packaging residues. In order to improve our knowledge on the level\
    \ of contamination, as well as on the nature of MP in organic amendments, the\
    \ PRO project (2021-2023) has been set up by Ademe (French Agency for Ecological\
    \ Transition). This project has several challenges: to identify the matrices acting\
    \ as sources of MP, to study the diversity and origins of these MP, and to estimate\
    \ the potential flows to agricultural land. Within this framework, the IRDL (Institut\
    \ de Recherche Dupuy de L\xF4me) is responsible for setting up and testing the\
    \ method for extracting and analysing MP contaminating these matrices. Our mission\
    \ is to validate a digestion protocol applicable to 21 complex solid matrices\
    \ rich in organic matter while, at the same time, ensuring the integrity of extracted\
    \ polymers (especially biodegradable ones). 83 samples are planned for this project,\
    \ and half have already been analysed. Preliminary recommendations following these\
    \ tests and unpublished results will be presented. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/427005/document"
