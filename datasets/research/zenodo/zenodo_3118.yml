  title: 'The impact of crop diversification, tillage and fertilization type on soil
    total microbial, fungal and bacterial abundance: A worldwide meta-analysis of
    agricultural sites'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis was performed to assess changes in microbial
    abundance in agricultural soils affected by: (i) management practices (tillage,
    fertilization and crop diversification); and (ii) environmental factors, including
    climate characteristics and soil properties. The scope of the meta-analysis was
    to evaluate whether microbial abundances are affected or not by organic fertilization
    or no fertilization, crop diversification (intercropping and crop rotations) and
    conservation tillage (reduced tillage/notillage) as an alternative to intensive
    conventional monocultures in agriculture. Only papers showing data on phospholipid
    fatty acids (PLFAs), providing indicators about soil microbial (total PLFA), fungal
    and bacterial biomass reached a critical mass to perform the meta-analysis. This
    work was funded by the European Commission Horizon 2020 project SoildiverAgro
    [grant agreement 817819].&lt;/p&gt;'
