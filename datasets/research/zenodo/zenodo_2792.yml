  title: Isotopic and molecular distribution of leaf-wax in plant-soil system of the
    Gangetic floodplain and its implication for paleorecords
  abstract: In this excel sheet, there are two tables mentioned as Table 1 and Table
    2. Table 1 shows the variation in long-chain n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids as
    well as their proxies in Trees, shrubs and grasses and also in soil. Table 2 contains
    variation in carbon and hydrogen isotopes among bulk, n-alkanes and n-alkanoic
    acids and their discrimination factors in Trees, shrubs and grasses and also in
    soil. Most of the datasets are obtained from Roy et al., (2020)
