  title: 'GEMAS: Geochemistry of European agricultural and grazing land soil'
  abstract: The project Geochemical Mapping of Agricultural and grazing land Soil
    (GEMAS) was carried out in 33 European countries (5.6 million km<sup>2</sup>)
    with an average sampling density of 1 site per 2500 km<sup>2</sup>. The main objective
    was to assess the chemical quality of productive soils. All collected soil samples
    were prepared in the same laboratory, and subsequently analysed for the same suite
    of elements and physicochemical parameters in the same laboratory following a
    strict quality control procedure. Data interpretation revealed that few soil samples
    reach element concentrations where toxicity may become of concern. However, more
    than 10% of samples contain such low element concentrations that deficiency for
    optimum plant growth and animal health may be a much larger issue warranting attention.
