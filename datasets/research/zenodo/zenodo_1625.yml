  title: A new spot test for the detection of dithiocarbamate fungicides in soil and
    water
  abstract: "Applied Chemistry Department, Z. H. College of Engineering and Technology,\
    \ Aligarh Muslim University,<br> Aligarh-202 002, India<br> <em>E-mail </em>:\
    \ hsrathore@mailcity .com<br> <em>Manuscript received 19 January 2005, revised\
    \ 13 June 2005, accepted 18 July 2005</em> A new spot test has been developed\
    \ for the detection of dithiocarbamate fungicides such as mancozeb, propineb and\
    \ zineb at nkg level in soil and water. The colour formation is based on the decomposition\
    \ of dithiocarbamate to carbon disulphide which reacts with plumbite ir\xB7 alkaline\
    \ medium to form a brown complex that finally converts to black lead sulphide.\
    \ The coloured product exists as a bright brown-black colloidal solution in formaldehyde\
    \ or glycerin or hydroxylamine hydrochloride."
