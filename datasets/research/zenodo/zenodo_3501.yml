  title: Effect of Soil Compaction on the Subgrade Strength of Road Pavement
  abstract: Abstract Investigations were carried out on how different compactible
    efforts affected the subgrade strength of road pavements. At a depth of 1.0 m,
    soil samples were taken, and subsequently subjected to compaction and California
    bearing ratio (CBR) tests. For the standard and modified Proctor compaction tests,
    the soil samples were poured into a mould in three and five equal layers, respectively.
    With 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 blows of the 2.5kg and 4.5kg rammer with
    a drop of 300mm and 450mm, respectively, under light and heavy compaction conditions,
    the standard and modified Proctor hammers compacted each layer uniformly. According
    to the proctor compaction test results, dry density increased with moisture content
    up to a maximum point before decreasing with additional increase in moisture content
    for the different numbers of blows. Additionally, the results of measuring the
    soil's Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) and Maximum Dry Density (MDD) with varying
    numbers of blows using 2.5 kg and 4.5 kg rammers revealed that while the maximum
    dry density increased with increasing number of blows, the optimum moisture content
    value decreased. Finally, with the 2.5kg and 4.5kg rammers, the results of the
    CBR test at various numbers of blows at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 revealed
    an increase in CBR with increasing number of blows. According to the aforementioned
    findings, compaction increases soils' CBR, which has an effect on the subgrade
    strength of road pavement since it reduces pavement thickness and cost.
