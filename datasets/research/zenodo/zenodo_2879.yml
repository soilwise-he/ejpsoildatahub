  title: Basic soil properties as a factor controlling the occurrence and intensity
    of water repellency in rankers of the White Carpathians
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Water repellency in soils is controlled by many different factors,
    basic physical and chemical properties might be considered the crucial ones. For
    the purpose of this study, 12 sites were selected and sampled (0&ndash;20 cm depth)
    in the White Carpathians. Repellency tests were conducted under laboratory conditions
    in triplicate using water drop penetration time (WDPT) test and the molarity of
    ethanol droplet (MED) test. Results of WDPT measurements showed that three samples
    were marked by slight to extreme water repellency. Regarding the relationship
    between WDPT/MED and tested soil properties, the highest value of correlation
    coefficient was calculated for soil organic carbon (r = 0.706; p &lt; 0.05), suggesting
    there is a positive, statistically significant correlation between repellency
    severity and total carbon content. A negative relationship between repellency
    and soil reaction/silt/silt + clay contents of studied soils was found. Samples
    taken from the surface horizon of arable soils showed no repellency.&lt;/p&gt;'
