  title: "Variables affecting the diversity of soil organisms in green areas of the\
    \ city of Donostia-San Sebasti\xE1n"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Urban green areas are suitable habitats for conserving soil
    biodiversity. The biota of urban soil performs a set of functions and associated
    ecosystem services of enormous importance. Unfortunately, the knowledge we currently
    have about soil organisms in urban environments is still very limited. The aim
    of this study was to identify those abiotic and biotic variables that have the
    greatest influence on the soil biodiversity of urban green areas. To this aim,
    thirty-eight urban green areas with different sizes, level of isolation (i.e.,
    habitat fragmentation), soil physicochemical properties and type of vegetation
    were sampled in the city of Donostia-San Sebasti&aacute;n (Spain) to measure the
    diversity and composition of macrofauna, mesofauna and microorganisms (i.e., bacterial
    communities). Variables related to the soil carbon content and habitat fragmentation
    significantly explained the diversity and composition of soil organisms in the
    studied urban green areas. Even so, the percentage of the variance explained by
    these two variables was very low. Understanding the ecological processes in urban
    environments will be helpful for the design and management of urban green areas
    to promote conservation of the biodiversity of multiple taxonomic groups in urban
    soil. &copy; 2020 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;'
