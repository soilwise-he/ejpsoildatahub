  title: Assessment and Characterization of Bacteria for  Biosurfactant-Producing
    Ability from Lambda- Cyhalothrin-Contaminated Cultivated Soil in Moro,  Kwara
    State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Microorganisms produced biosurfactants are promising agents in the bioremediation\
    \ of pesticide polluted soils as a result of their biodegradability and non-toxic\
    \ nature. This study was aimed at screening bacteria for biosurfactant production\
    \ in pesticide contaminated agricultural soil, and identify them using molecular\
    \ technique. Ten bacteria species with potentials to degrade lambda-cyhalothrin\
    \ isolated in our previous study were screened for biosurfactant production via\
    \ the drop collapse, oil spreading, emulsification index, hydrocarbon overlay\
    \ agar and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon tests. The biosurfactant producers\
    \ were identified using the 16S rRNA. Results from the biosurfactant screening\
    \ showed that out of the ten bacteria screened only four of the ten bacteria screened\
    \ which were identified as Bacillus strains were strongly positive for production\
    \ of biosurfactant. The four \_Biosurfactant-Producing Lambda Cyhalothrin- Degrading\
    \ Bacteria (LCDB-BP) were identified using 16S \_rRNA as Bacillus tequilensis\
    \ strain LCDB-BP1, Bacillus subtilis strain LCDB-BP2, Bacillus altitudinis strain\
    \ LCDB-BP3, and Bacillus subtilis strain LCDB-BP4 with the accession numbers OP703607,\
    \ OP703608, OP703609 and OP703610 respectively. These organisms can be useful\
    \ for biosurfactant production and bioremediation of synthetic pyrethroid contaminated\
    \ soil.\nKeywords:- Biosurfactant, Synthetic Pyrethroids (SP), Lambda-cyhalothrin\
    \ (LC), Bacillus species, cultivated soil."
