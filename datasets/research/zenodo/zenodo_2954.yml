  title: 'SOIL CHARACTERISTICS AND PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF SOME FORAGE SPECIES IN
    BOBI GRAZING RESERVE, NIGER STATE, NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR RUMINANT ANIMAL NUTRITION'
  abstract: "The Experiment was carried out in Bobi Grazing Reserve, Niger state,\
    \ Nigeria from May<br> \u2013 October, 2014 \u2013 2016 to evaluate soil characteristics\
    \ and proximate composition of six<br> forage species namely Paspalum commersonii\
    \ Cyperus esculentus Hyparrheni<br> achrysegyrea Digiteria smutsii Seteria barbata\
    \ and Brachiaria deflexa. Soil was<br> obtained for analysis at 0 \u2013 15 and\
    \ 15 \u2013 30 cm for subsoil analysis using the method of<br> NSCS 2013. The\
    \ physic-chemical analysis was done using the method outlined by<br> ISRIC/FAO\
    \ 2003. The methods of AOAC (2000) was used to determine the proximate<br> composition\
    \ of the forages. The soil acidity ranged from 6.38 \u2013 6.90, The soil was<br>\
    \ generally sandy, the soil fertility was suboptimal. All the proximate values\
    \ of the forages<br> showed significant differences across the years 2014, 2015\
    \ and 2016, the dry matter<br> contents of the forages ranged from 59.49 to 89.19%\
    \ forage growth and nutritive value<br> were not impressive. It was concluded\
    \ that soil characteristics and rainfall influenced the<br> nutritive value of\
    \ forages in Bobi Grazing Reserve. Soil conservation and improvement ,<br> irrigation\
    \ as well as planting of more legumes were recommended"
