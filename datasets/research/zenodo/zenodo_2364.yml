  title: THE CONDUCTOMETRIC METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SOLUBLE SALT CONTENT OF SOILS
    FOR USE IN SOIL SURVEY WORK.
  abstract: 'The conductivity of soil suspensions has been determined with Dionic
    water tester. The salt content of soils may be derived from the conductivity of
    1 : 15 suspensions by a very simple relationship, i.e., the conductivity value,
    if divided by one thousand, gives the percentage salt content of soils. To determine
    the total salt content of soils by the present method, the use of distilled water
    only for making the soil suspensions is suggested as it has been shown that the
    use of salt-containing water brings about depression in the conductivity value
    which varies with the nature of the salts present in the water used. This conductometric
    method of determining soluble salt content has been tested for a set of soils
    derived from the various parts of India and the results seem to justify the adoption
    of this method in this country for soil survey work.'
