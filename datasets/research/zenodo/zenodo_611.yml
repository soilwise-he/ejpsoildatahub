  title: 'Integrated nutrient management: An sustainable approach for soil productivity.'
  abstract: Integrated Nutrient Management approach to the management of plant nutrients
    for maintaining and enhancing soil, Soil fertility maintenance requires a balanced
    application of inorganic and organic nutrient sources. Sustainable agricultural
    productivity might be achieved through a wise use of integrated nutrient management.
    Integrated use of organic and inorganic source of plant nutrients on growth and
    yield attributes is very crucial for assurance of food security. The integrated
    plant nutrient supply/management is important approach for maintenance or adjustment
    of soil fertility and plant nutrient supply to an optimum level for sustainable
    crop productivity through optimization of benefit from all possible sources of
    plant nutrients in an integrated manner which includes; Maintain or enhance soil
    productivity through a balanced use of fertilizers combined with organic and biological
    sources of plant nutrients and also to reduce inorganic (fertilizer) input cost.
    Organic sources such as FYM, bio compost, vermicompost, decompose, green manures,
    crop residues and industrial wastes have been used in various cropping systems.
    Soil as a source of nutrients, must be protected from all kinds of external factors,
    especially from the addition of fertilizers in excessive rates. Any degradation
    in the quality of soil can significantly produce many undesirable changes in the
    environment and also reduces the overall crop yield. The amount and availability
    of nutrients in organic materials vary widely, which makes interpretation of the
    value of nutrients supplied.
