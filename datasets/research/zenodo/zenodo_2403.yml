  title: The impact of manure and soil texture on antimicrobial resistance gene levels
    in farmlands and adjacent ditches
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Manure application can spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
    from manure to soil and surface water. This study evaluated the role of the soil
    texture on the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in soils and
    sur- rounding surface waters. Six dairy farms with distinct soil textures (clay,
    sand, and peat) were sampled at different time points after the application of
    manure, and three representative ARGs sul1, erm(B), and tet(W) were quantified
    with qPCR. Manuring initially increased levels of erm(B) by 1.5 &plusmn; 0.5 log
    copies/kg of soil and tet (W) by 0.8 &plusmn; 0.4 log copies/kg across soil textures,
    after which levels gradually declined. In surface waters from clay environments,
    regardless of the ARG, the gene levels initially increased by 2.6 &plusmn; 1.6
    log copies/L, after which levels gradually declined. The gene decay in soils was
    strongly dependent on the type of ARG (erm (B) &lt; tet(W) &lt; sul1; half-lives
    of 7, 11, and 75 days, respectively), while in water, the decay was primarily
    dependent on the soil texture adjacent to the sampled surface water (clay &lt;
    peat &lt; sand; half-lives of 2, 6, and 10 days, respectively). Finally, recovery
    of ARG levels was predicted after 29&ndash;42 days. The results thus showed that
    there was not a complete restoration of ARGs in soils between rounds of manure
    application. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that rather than showing similar
    dynamics of decay, factors such as the type of ARG and soil texture drive the
    ARG persistence in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;'
