  title: SOIL CHOIR v.1.3 - soil moisture sonification installation
  abstract: "The artistic sonification offers a creative method for putting direct\
    \ semantic layers to the abstract sounds. This paper is dedicated to the sound\
    \ installation \"Soil choir v.1.3\" that sonifies soil moisture in different depths\
    \ and transforms this non-musical phenomenon into organized sound structures.\
    \ The sonification of natural soil moisture processes tests the limits of our\
    \ attention, patience and willingness to still perceive ultra-slow reactions and\
    \ examines the mechanisms of our sense adaptation. Although the musical time of\
    \ the installation is set to almost non-human \u2013 environmental time scale\
    \ (changes happen within hours, days, weeks or even months\u2026) this system\
    \ can be explored and even played also as an instrument by putting sensors to\
    \ different soil areas or pouring liquid into the soil and waiting for changes...\
    \ The crucial aspect of the work was to design the sonification architecture that\
    \ deals with extreme slow changes of input data \u2013 measured values from moisture\
    \ sensors. The result is the sound installation consisting of three objects \u2013\
    \ each with different types of soil. Every object is compact, independent unit\
    \ consisting of three low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensors, 1m long perspex\
    \ tube filled with soil, full range loudspeaker and Bela platform with custom\
    \ Supercollider code. I developed this installation during the year 2019 and this\
    \ paper gives insight into the aspects and issues connected with creating this\
    \ installation."
