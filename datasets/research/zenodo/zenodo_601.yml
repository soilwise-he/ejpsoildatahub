  title: Soil pollution; hard revenge on the future innocent generation!
  abstract: After air and water, soil is our most important source. The importance
    of soil stems from the fact that it takes at least 200 to 300 years to form one
    square centimeter of soil. In addition to the important role that soil plays in
    animal life, it has also played a role in the evolution and emergence of life.
    The study of cations in soil and seawater solution and its comparison with cations
    in the body of plants and animals shows that the concentration of soluble cations
    in soil is more similar to the cations in the body of plants and animals than
    the cations in seawater. Soil, as one of the most important vital elements for
    production and as a God-given wealth, is so important that its preservation as
    a legacy of the past for the future, in the past decades, faced problems such
    as erosion, subsidence and occupation by opportunists. have been. It takes 300
    years to produce 1 cm of soil, but only 1 hour to destroy 1 meter of soil!<br>
    Accordingly, considering the importance of soil, as one of the most important
    elements of nature, in 2002, to honor the importance of soil and the attention
    of nations and governments to its preservation and protection, December 5 was
    named as World Soil Day. Iran has an area of about 165 million hectares, of which
    89.1 million hectares are without soil and 75.9 million hectares have soil, of
    which 57.5 million hectares are out of the agricultural cycle and only 18.5 million
    hectares in the cycle. Is cultivation! Contrary to popular belief, therefore,
    the most valuable natural resource is not oil, but soil. If the soil is not protected,
    water management will be ineffective; So the problem of soil is even more important
    than water!
