  title: Comparing microbial community heterogeneity in soil under organic and conventional
    agricultural system cultivated with olive and peach trees in three fields differ
    with age at Al-Jouf Saudi Arabia
  abstract: This research study was carried out at Al-Jouf region, north eastern Saudi
    Arabia, to investigate the differences in microbial community and density of microorganisms
    in the rhizosphere of olive (Olea europaea) and peach (Prunus persica) tree fields
    subjected to growth under organic and conventional agriculture systems. The soil
    analytical processes were conducted in three olive and three peach fields (9,
    17, 27 years old and 20 ha in area) under organic fertilization, and three similar
    olive and peach fields under conventional fertilization system. The results indicated
    significant variations between the two agricultural systems in rhizosphere content
    of microbial and mycorrhizal colonization%. The highest percentages of actinomycetes,
    total fungi and bacteria (PSM) were recorded in the organically agricultural system
    (OAS) in olive fields in comparison to conventionally agricultural system (CAS).
    Regarding field ages OAS dominated CAS in total number of fungi under all olive
    fields ages, while under peach fields fungi counts were significantly high under
    CAS compared to OAS. Under peach fields OAS dominated giving the highest actinomycetes
    and bacteria and CAS dominated by giving the highest CFU and fungi count. The
    significantly highest counts of CFU and bacteria were attained under conventional
    farming system (CAS) in all of the different aged field compared to OAS. Actinomycetes
    and bacteria in young fields were significantly high under CAS, while in old fields
    actinomycetes and fungi counts were the highest under OAS.
