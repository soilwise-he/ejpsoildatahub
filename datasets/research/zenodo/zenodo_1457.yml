  title: Yield of Rice Under Chronic Air Pollution Stress, As Influenced By Soil Nitrogen
  abstract: This article 'Yield of Rice Under Chronic Air Pollution Stress, As Influenced
    By Soil Nitrogen' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series,
    created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective
    of this publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with
    the development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems.
    This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the production
    of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce
    nations in the world.
