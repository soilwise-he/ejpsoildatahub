  title: 'Seismic performance of bar-mat reinforced-soil retaining wall: Shaking table
    testing versus numerical analysis with modified kinematic hardening constitutive
    model'
  abstract: "Reinforced-soil retaining structures possess inherent flexibility, and\
    \ are believed to be insensitive to earthquake shaking. In fact, several such\
    \ structures have successfully survived destructive earthquakes (Northridge 1994,\
    \ Kobe 1995, Kocaeli 1999, and Chi-Chi 1999). This paper investigates experimentally\
    \ and theoretically the seismic performance of a typical bar-mat retaining wall.\
    \ First, a series of reduced- scale shaking table tests are conducted, using a\
    \ variety of seismic excitations (real records and artificial multi-cycle motions).\
    \ Then, the problem is analyzed numerically employing the finite element method.\
    \ A modified kinematic hardening constitutive model is developed and encoded in\
    \ ABAQUS through a user-defined subroutine. After calibrating the model parameters\
    \ through laboratory element testing, the retaining walls are analyzed at model\
    \ scale, assuming model parameters appropriate for very small confining pressures.\
    \ After validating the numerical analysis through comparisons with shaking table\
    \ test results, the problem is re-analyzed at prototype scale assuming model parameters\
    \ for standard confining pressures. The results of shaking table testing are thus\
    \ indirectly \u2018\u2018converted\u2019\u2019(extrapolated) to real scale. It\
    \ is shown that: (a) for medium intensity motions (typical of Ms \u2248 6 earthquakes)\
    \ the response is \u2018\u2018quasi-elastic\u2019\u2019, and the permanent lateral\
    \ displacement in reality could not exceed a few centimeters; (b) for larger intensity\
    \ motions (typical of Ms \u2248 6.5\u20137 earthquakes) bearing the effects of\
    \ forward rupture directivity or having a large number of strong motion cycles,\
    \ plastic deformation accumulates and the permanent displacement is of the order\
    \ of 10\u201315 cm (at prototype scale); and (c) a large number of strong motion\
    \ cycles (N&gt;30) of un realistically large amplitude (A \u22481.0 g) is required\
    \ to activate a failure wedge behind the region of reinforced soil. Overall, the\
    \ performance of the bar-mat reinforced-soil walls investigated in this paper\
    \ is totally acceptable for realistic levels of seismic excitation."
