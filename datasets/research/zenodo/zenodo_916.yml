  title: Treatment of Diesel Oil Contaminated Soil by Ex-situ Bioremediation
  abstract: "Treatment of oil-polluted soil is a challenging problem faced by all\
    \ refineries and petrochemical industries. In this research study, bioremediation\
    \ of diesel oil contaminated soil was conducted for diesel concentration ranging\
    \ from 5% to 20%. The physicochemical characteristics of diesel oil contaminated\
    \ soil were studied. The effects of soil amendments, namely coconut ash powder,\
    \ biofilter activated sludge, and NPK fertilizer, on total petroleum hydrocarbon\
    \ removal efficiency were studied. The maximum total petroleum hydrocarbon removal\
    \ efficiency achieved was 94.5% when 4g NPK, 40g of activated sludge and 40g of\
    \ coconut ash powder per 1000g of contaminated soil were used. The studies on\
    \ the effect of temperature confirmed the optimal temperature as 35\xB0C. The\
    \ parametric studies confirmed that the degradation efficiency decreased with\
    \ increase in diesel oil concentration."
