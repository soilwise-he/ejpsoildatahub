  title: Impact of Biofield Energy Treatment on Soil Fertility
  abstract: "Measurement of soil components such as microbial population, minerals\
    \ and obviously the content of organic carbon play the important roles for the\
    \ productivity of crops and plants. The present study was attempted to evaluate\
    \ the impact of Mr. Trivedi\u2019s biofield energy treatment on soil for its physical\
    \ (electrical conductivity), chemical (minerals) and microbial flora (bacteria\
    \ and fungi). A plot of lands was assigned for this study with some already grown\
    \ plants. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered as control,\
    \ while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi\u2019s biofield energy treatment\
    \ without physically touching and referred as treated. In the treated soil the\
    \ total bacterial and fungal counts were increased by 546 and 617%, respectively\
    \ as compared to the untreated soil. Additionally, the conductivity of soil of\
    \ the treated plot was increased by 79% as compared to the soil of control plot.\
    \ Apart from microbes, the content of various minerals were also changed in the\
    \ biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content showed 2909 ppm\
    \ in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to 3943 ppm i.e.\
    \ 36% increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium were increased\
    \ by 12% and 7%, respectively as compared to the control. Besides, the level of\
    \ some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased by 9%, 23%,\
    \ and 41%, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical constituents\
    \ of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8% in the treated\
    \ soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged that the\
    \ biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement in the\
    \ physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component. Thus, improved\
    \ the conductance, supportive microbes, minerals and overall productivity of crops.\
    \ In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative\
    \ way to increase the yield of quality crops by increasing soil fertility.\n\n\
