  title: Quantitative Changes in Available Iron and Manganese as Influenced by Moisture
    Regimes of Soil
  abstract: Faculty of Agriculture, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, Kalyani,
    West Bengal. <em>Manuscript received 23 February 1976 ; accepted 30 March 1976</em>
    The changes in the available forms of iron and manganese on moistening and drying
    the soils were studied both under normal and sterile conditions. Under normal
    condition moistening the soil reduced and drying increased the available and easily
    reducible manganese, and these were attributed to biological oxidation and chemical
    reduction respectively. Quantity of ferrous iron increased on wet incubation and
    decreased on redrying the samples under normal condition, whereas the opposite
    picture was noted in soils sterilized with sodium azide solution.
