  title: Soil Salinity and Some Physiological Indicators of Cotton Varieties
  abstract: ABSTRACT The article deals with the information about the effect of saline
    stress factors on some physiological parameters of medium-fiber cotton varieties.
    According to the results of the study experiments, Bukhara-8 and Bukhara-102 cotton
    varieties have a high level of resistance to saline stress. The degree of adaptation
    of cotton in Bukhara-8 and Bukhara-102 varieties to soil salinity and arid unfavorable
    environmental conditions is higher than in Bukhara-10 and Sultan, Andijan-35 varieties.
    Variations in the value of physiological parameters studied in the cross-section
    of varieties were found to depend on their biological and individual characteristics.
