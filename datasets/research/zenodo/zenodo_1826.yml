  title: Response Of Raspberry (Rubus Idaeus L.) On Soil Mulching And Foliar Nutrition
    With Manganese
  abstract: "Raspberry is one of the most important species of fruit plants in Poland.\
    \ The consumer usefulness and processing of fruits determined the taste and chemical\
    \ composition. The raspberry fruits contain many valuable and important for human\
    \ health ingredients. Furthermore the raspberries have a very high value of beekeeping.\
    \ The main determinants of achieving a high yield and high biological value are\
    \ a good supply of plant in the macro- and micronutrients and properly prepared\
    \ soil.The aim of the study was to determine the response of raspberry on the\
    \ soil mulching and foliar nutrition with manganese. In the study were included\
    \ the following factors: I) type of bedding: black foil, black agri-woven, pine\
    \ bark, wheat straw, soil without bedding \u2013 control; II) foliar nutrition\
    \ with manganese and without foliar nutrition. Yield of fruits, weight of 100\
    \ fruits, length of shoots, fruiting terms and the number of harvests were specified.\
    \ It was found that the soil bedding in the raspberries rows had no significant\
    \ effect on the plant yielding, weight of fruits, length of shoots and the number\
    \ of harvests. Foliar nutrition with manganese had a significant negative impact\
    \ on the yield of raspberry fruits and their mass. While the foliar nutrition\
    \ of plants had a significantly positive impact on the growth of raspberry shoots."
