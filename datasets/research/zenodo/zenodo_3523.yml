  title: Soil-Plant Degradation And Their Inter-Relation At Saline Desert Ecosystem.
  abstract: High salinity is contributing significantly to environmental degradation.
    Saline desert (Little Rann of Kutch of 4860 ha) was selected to study soil and
    vegetation. Soil was analyzed at different depth 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45cm. Maximum
    salinity was 24.033dSm-1. Mean values for FC, WHC, OC, N, P, Ca, K and Na were
    20.456%, 28.250%, 0.344%, 0.030%, 22.727kg ha-1, 103.293mg kg-1, 841.276mg kg-1
    and 144.395mg kg-1. Calcium and herbaceous density (153.601mg kg-1 and 0.646plants
    m-2) was maximum and sodium (65.490mg kg-1) was minimum (site two). Results suggest
    that calcium have beneficial effect to overcome salinity and minimise the effect
    of sodium in the soil.
