  title: Pedological Characterization and Soil Classification of Selected Soil Units
    of Morogoro District, Tanzania
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study aimed at provision of research information by pedological
    characterization of soil units of Morogoro District, Tanzania. Three soil units
    were selected coupled with field reconnaissance survey. Soil pedons were characterized
    at Kiziwa (KZW-P1), Mkambarani (MKA-P1) and Fulwe (FUL-P1). Pedons were observed
    to be formed from in-situ weathering of granitic rocks under ustic moisture and
    iso-hyperthermic temperature regimes. Thirteen soil samples were described and
    analyzed for physica-chemical and mineralogical properties. KZW-P1 and FUL-P1
    had red dark brown sandy clay and gravely clay (MKA-P1) top soils overlaying mainly
    clayey subsoil. Both pedons indicate clay eluviation-illuviation as a dominant
    pedogenic process with slightly acidic condition and P&lt;7 except FUL-P1 with
    23.8 mg/kg P in top soils. Organic carbon is low in both pedons while total N
    is low to very low. CEC values for both pedons are 33.8, 26.4 and 27 cmol(+)/kg
    respectively. CIA values indicates intermediate to strong level of weathering.
    In USDA Soil Taxonomy and the FAO-UNESCO soil classification system, Soils were
    classified as: Kiziwa Ultisols (Alisols), and Inceptisols (Cambisols) for Fulwe
    and Mkambarani, reflecting their differences in potentials and constraints and
    hence use and management. The results reflects variations in soil characteristics
    both vertically and laterally so as to account for spatial linkages within the
    landscape.&lt;/p&gt;'
