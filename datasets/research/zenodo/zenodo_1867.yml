  title: Assessing soil contamination and temporal trends of heavy metal contents
    in greenhouses on semiarid land
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;Information about the behavior and temporal\
    \ evolution of heavy metals in agricultural&nbsp;soils is limited, particularly\
    \ about greenhouse soils on semiarid lands, indeed it nonexistent.&lt;br&gt;Western\
    \ Almer&iacute;a (Southern Spain) is a semiarid land where some 30,000 ha are&nbsp;occupied\
    \ by greenhouses with high productivity. As these greenhouses are fundamental&nbsp;to\
    \ the socioeconomic development of this area, they should be maintained and well&lt;br&gt;conserved.\
    \ However, there are indications that long\u2010term intensive agriculture with&nbsp;considerable\
    \ agrochemicals use can deteriorate soil quality, which in turn, would reduce&nbsp;productivity\
    \ and food quality. This study was conducted to investigate soil contamination&nbsp;and\
    \ the temporal trends of heavy metal concentrations in greenhouse soils of&nbsp;western\
    \ Almer&iacute;a. Contamination level, availability, and sources of metals were\
    \ evaluated&nbsp;by the extractable fraction percentage, by indices zinc equivalent,&nbsp;geoaccumulation,\
    \ enrichment factor and pollution load, and by a correlation analysis&nbsp;between\
    \ soil properties and metal contents. The results showed that the total contents&nbsp;of\
    \ Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb, and the available concentration of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, were\
    \ significantly&nbsp;higher than background levels. Temporal patterns indicated\
    \ that these elements&nbsp;accumulate in greenhouse soils. After more than 20\
    \ years of intensive agriculture, the&nbsp;available concentration of elements,\
    \ and contamination, had clearly increased.&lt;/p&gt;"
