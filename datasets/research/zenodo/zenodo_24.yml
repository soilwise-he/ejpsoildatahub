  title: "A soil\u2010quality index for soil from Mediterranean forests"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Treatments involving vegetation thinning have become more frequent
    in Mediterranean&lt;br&gt;forest ecosystems. Under extreme climate conditions,
    this practice can affect&lt;br&gt;the balance between physicochemical, microbiological
    and biochemical soil properties,&lt;br&gt;modifying the soil quality and the ability
    of these forest ecosystems to regenerate.&lt;br&gt;The aim of this study was to
    use principal component analysis (PCA) to&lt;br&gt;develop a multivariable soil-quality
    index (SQI) applicable to the Mediterranean&lt;br&gt;forest ecosystems of the
    Cuenca mountain range in central-eastern Spain. To&lt;br&gt;achieve this, seven
    physicochemical properties (moisture, pH, electrical conductivity,&lt;br&gt;carbonate,
    total organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus) and&lt;br&gt;six
    microbiological properties (basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon, as&lt;br&gt;well
    as the activity of dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and &beta;-glucosidase&lt;br&gt;enzymes)
    were measured seasonally between 2011 and 2012. Soil samples were&lt;br&gt;obtained
    from seven unmanaged and undisturbed forest areas and these data were&lt;br&gt;used
    to create the SQI. Subsequently, we applied this SQI to soil samples from&lt;br&gt;other
    forests in the Cuenca mountain range, which had been affected by different&lt;br&gt;thinning
    treatments. Our analysis showed that the greater was the canopy present&lt;br&gt;in
    these treated forests, the larger were the average values for all 13 variables.
    The&lt;br&gt;smallest SQI values were in areas that had been intensively thinned.
    Therefore, our&lt;br&gt;results suggest that this SQI is an important tool for
    the development of appropriate&lt;br&gt;measures to maintain the quality of forest
    soil in Spanish Mediterranean forest ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;'
