  title: "Soil contamination from heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (PAH,\
    \ PCB and HCB) in the coastal area of V\xE4sternorrland, Sweden"
  abstract: "This paper presents an experimental study on the leaching of heavy metals,\
    \ toxic chemicals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) \u2013 PAh, PCB and\
    \ HCB \u2013 from soil dredged from the coastal area of V\xE4sternorrland in northern\
    \ Sweden. The soil was stabilized with cement/slag. Samples were subjected to\
    \ modified surface leaching and shake tests using technical standards of the Swedish\
    \ Geotechnical Institute (SGI). The experiments were performed using different\
    \ blends of binding agents (30/70, 50/50, 70/30) and binder quantities (120 and\
    \ 150 kg/m3) to analyze their effects on leaching. Soil properties, tools, and\
    \ workflow are described. Binders included Portland cement and ground granulated\
    \ blast furnace slag (GGBFS). Samples were tested to evaluate the min/max contents\
    \ of pollutants (\u03BCg/l) for heavy metals (As, Ba, Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, hg,\
    \ Mn, Mo, ni, S, V, Zn) and the hydrocarbon fraction index in the excess water.\
    \ The leaching of heavy metals and POPs was assessed in sediments after the addition\
    \ of the binder. The comparison was made against the two mixes (cement/slag in\
    \ 30/70% and high/low binder with low/high water ratio). The results showed that\
    \ 70% slag decreases the leaching of heavy metals and POPs. The equilibrium concentrations\
    \ of DOC and heavy metals at L/S 10 (\u03BCg/l) were measured during the shake\
    \ experiments to compare their levels in the groundwater that was used as a leachate.\
    \ The leached content was assessed at L/S 10 in the upscaling experiments using\
    \ four samples for PAH, PCB and various fractions of hydrocarbons: C10\u2013C40,\
    \ C10\u2013C12, C12\u2013C16 and C35\u2013C40. The shake test showed a decrease\
    \ in the leaching of heavy metals and POP substances from the soil subjected to\
    \ stabilization by a higher amount of slag added as a binder. A binder blend with\
    \ 30% cement and 70% of GGBFS showed the best performance."
