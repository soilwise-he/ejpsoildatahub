  title: Total Hydrocarbon Content of the Bitumen Impacted  Soil in Ondo State, Nigeria
  abstract: 'Total hydrocarbon content concentrations were determined in soil collected
    from Agbabu, Western Nigeria, in the dry season and rainy season for two years.
    Samples were analyzed using the UV-vis spectrophotometer (HACH 2400). The average
    concentration of 146.89 ppm recorded in Dry Season of Year-1 was higher than the
    100 ppm recommended for a normal soil by Regulation on the assessment of environmental
    pollution by European Geosciences Union. 5.36 ppm in the Rainy Season of Year-1,
    5.00 ppm in the Dry Season of Year-2 and 4.92 ppm in the Rainy Season of Year-2
    were lower that value recommended for a normal soil. The average concentrations
    recorded were higher than the values recorded at the control sampling points.
    These indicate that the soil of Agbabu and Temidire has been impacted with total
    hydrocarbon due to the bitumen deposit and other anthropogenic activities. This
    is dangerous for the health of the rural dwellers at Agbabu and Temidire because
    the total hydrocarbon can bioaccumulate and biomagnify and and affect the biota
    through food chain. Compounds containing total hydrocarbon cause side effects
    on the blood, immune system, lungs, skin and eyes. The soils of Agbabu and Temidire
    will not require remediation because it may recover through a natural attenuation.
    However, a program should be put in place by the stake holders to periodically
    monitor the status of total hydrocarbon in the soil of Agbabu and Temidire in
    Ondo State, Nigeria.
