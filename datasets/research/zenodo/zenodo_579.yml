  title: Crop diversification enhances key soil quality parameters related to soil
    functioning without compromising crop yield in a rainfed woody crop system
  abstract: Soils provide key ecosystem services and are crucial to combat climate
    change. Agriculture provides important ecosystem services but also causes negative
    environmental effects depending on agricultural management. In this regard, crop
    diversification is a promising sustainable land management strategy to combat
    soil erosion and degradation, mitigate climate change and ensure food security.
    Here, we assess the short-term impacts of crop diversification on several key
    soil physico-chemical parameters related to soil functioning as well as on crop
    yields in a rainfed almond (<em>Prunus dulcis</em> Mill.) orchard under semiarid
    Mediterranean conditions. Almond trees were inter-cropped with <em>Capparis spinosa</em>
    L. (caper) or <em>Thymus hyemalis</em> Lange (winter thyme) and compared with
    the almond monocrop system. The experimental design consisted of three plots in
    a randomized-block design, with three replicates for each crop management treatment
    (almond monocrop, almond inter-cropped with caper, and almond inter-cropped with
    winter thyme). Along with crop yields, the effects of crop diversification on
    a range of soil quality and health indicators including soil physical (bulk density,
    aggregate stability, water retention and availability) and chemical (total and
    particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate content, available
    macro- and micro-nutrients) properties were monitored in the topsoil and subsoil
    (at 0-10 and 10-30 cm depth, respectively) one and three years from establishment.
    Results from this study indicate that both crop diversifications enhanced soil
    water retention capacity and water availability for plants after three years from
    their implementation at 0-30 cm depth. Likewise, improvements in particulate organic
    carbon and available N were observed in the subsoil of both crop diversifications.
    Crop diversification did not significantly affect the main crop yields, highlighting
    that crop diversification can be a promising sustainable management practice for
    improving soil health without compromising food security under semiarid Mediterranean
    conditions. Indeed, land equivalent ratios (LER) of almond trees inter-cropped
    with winter thyme were higher than those of their respective monocrop systems
    for two consecutive years, indicating that inter-cropping with aromatics can improve
    the productivity of rainfed woody monocrop systems under semiarid conditions.
    Our results emphasize the importance of selecting an appropriate secondary crop
    that ensures a permanent soil cover while contributes to enhance the agroecosystem
    productivity from the first year of establishment onwards to off-set plausible
    lower yields from the main crop. In this regard, preliminary assessments on soil
    condition and crop nutrient requirements are encouraged before designing and implementing
    a crop diversification in these low-input cropping systems. Likewise, long-term
    studies are needed to provide evidence on the stability of the production of diversified
    crop management, particularly in these low-input cropping systems under harsh
    environmental conditions.
