  title: Metabolite and element interactions of developing seeds for adaptation to
    variable soil nutrients at contrasting geological phosphorus sites
  abstract: Phosphorus (P) -rich soils developed in phospharite areas while P-deficient
    soils are ubiquitous in subtropical areas. Across such the contrasting nutrient
    environments, it is little known how metabolites are involved for archiving optimal
    storage of energy and nutrients in plant seeds. Here we measured metabolites,
    element concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of <em>Quercus variabilis</em>
    acorns at the early (July), middle (August) and late (September) stages at geological-derived
    P-rich and P-deficient sites in subtropical China. Our results showed that the
    acorns of oak populations between two site types were significantly discriminated,
    at three stages, by metabolites (predominantly sugars and organic acids) and by
    ionome (majorly protein/nucleic acid (N, P, S) and enzyme (Mn and Cu) -related
    elements). These biomarkers were mainly linked to the carbon and nitrogen metabolisms,
    especially, pentose phosphoric acid pathway, in acorns. Moreover, these discriminating
    metabolites were correlated with N, P, S, Mg and Mn in acorns while they both
    were associated to certain extent with N, Mg and Mn in soils across two site types.
    These results suggest that for developing seeds, carbon and nitrogen metabolism
    could be a key mechanism for <em>in situ</em> plants to copy with variable nutrients
    in soils.
