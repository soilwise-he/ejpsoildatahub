  title: The potential of corn (Zea Mays) for phytoremediation of soil contaminated
    with heavy metals
  abstract: Heavy metal pollution is a significant environmental problem and has a
    negative impact on human health and agriculture. Phytoremediation has recently
    emerged as an efficient heavy metal remediation technology. To examine the phytoremediation
    potential, an experiment was conducted, where the influence of high and low concentrations
    of heavy metals, lead, cadmium and zinc (Pb, Cd and Zn) on the phenological characteristics
    of corn (<em>Zea mays</em>), as well as their accumulation in the underground
    and aboveground part was monitored. The experiment was carried out in outdoor
    conditions in pots in which corn was planted and the soil was contaminated with
    heavy metals in concentrations below and above the maximum allowable concentration
    prescribed by the Ordinance. The experiment lasted 45 days. By processing the
    results, statistically significant differences in plant development were determined.The
    highest concentration of Zn was recorded in the aboveground part of the plant,
    the stem in the amount of 24.443 mg/kg, and the lowest concentration in the leaf
    0.216 mg/kg. The highest concentrations of Cd and Pb were recorded in the root,
    for lead 26.610 mg/kg and in the stem for cadmium 30.490 mg/kg, which is a statistically
    significantly higher established value compared to other parts of the plant.
