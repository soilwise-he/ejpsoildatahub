  title: Estimation Of Subgrade Resilient Modulus From Soil Index Properties
  abstract: "Determination of Resilient Modulus (M<sub>R</sub>) is quite important\
    \ for characterizing materials in pavement design and evaluation. The main focus\
    \ of this study is to develop a correlation that predict the resilient modulus\
    \ of subgrade soils from simple and easy measured soil index properties. To achieve\
    \ this objective, three subgrade soils representing typical Khartoum soils were\
    \ selected and tested in the laboratory for measuring resilient modulus. Other\
    \ basic laboratory tests were conducted on the soils to determine their physical\
    \ properties. Several soil samples were prepared and compacted at different moisture\
    \ contents and dry densities and then tested using resilient modulus testing machine.\
    \ Based on experimental results, linear relationship of M<sub>R</sub> with the\
    \ consistency factor \u2018F<sub>c</sub>\u2019 which is a combination of dry density,\
    \ void ratio and consistency index had been developed. The results revealed that\
    \ very good linear relationship found between the M<sub>R</sub> and the consistency\
    \ factor with a coefficient of linearity (R<sup>2</sup>) more than 0.9. The consistency\
    \ factor could be used for the prediction of the M<sub>R</sub> of compacted subgrade\
    \ soils with precise and reliable results."
