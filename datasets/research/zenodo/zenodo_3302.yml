  title: Effect of Biochar on Tomato Productivity and Soil chemical Properties under
    Acidic Soil Condition
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nBiochar is being evaluated globally as a means to improve\
    \ soil fertility, ecosystem services and sequester carbon. This study presents\
    \ an attempt to analysing the influence of biochar application on the soil properties,\
    \ growth, yield of tomato plant under acid soil. The study was conducted at Sher-e-Bangla\
    \ Agricultural University during Robi season 2022 with 2 factor Randomized Completely\
    \ Block Design. Factor A was the different acid soils with pH 6.5, 5.5, 5.0 and\
    \ 4.5 and Factor B was the control, biocar and biochar+compost. The results showed\
    \ that soil pH, bulk density, water content and soil organic matter were improved\
    \ significantly as biochar and biochar + compost application. Biochar application\
    \ also enhanced plant height, leaf number and yield components of tomato plant.\
    \ It also revealed that combined application of biochar and compost increased\
    \ the uptake and available of N, P, K than biochar alone and control in different\
    \ level of acid soils. It was found that biochar + compost treatment in the whole\
    \ growing period was best to improve tomato plant growth and yield, providing\
    \ a biochar amendment recommendation for tomato production in field. Moreover,\
    \ biochar application improved the soil physical and chemical properties. Therefore,\
    \ biochar amendment could be an effective option to improve acidity affected croplands.\n\
