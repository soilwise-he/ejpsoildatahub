  title: Development Of A Neural Network Based Algorithm For Multi-Scale Roughness
    Parameters And Soil Moisture Retrieval
  abstract: 'The overall objective of this paper is to retrieve soil

    surfaces parameters namely, roughness and soil moisture related to

    the dielectric constant by inverting the radar backscattered signal

    from natural soil surfaces.

    Because the classical description of roughness using statistical

    parameters like the correlation length doesn''t lead to satisfactory

    results to predict radar backscattering, we used a multi-scale

    roughness description using the wavelet transform and the Mallat

    algorithm. In this description, the surface is considered as a

    superposition of a finite number of one-dimensional Gaussian

    processes each having a spatial scale. A second step in this study

    consisted in adapting a direct model simulating radar backscattering

    namely the small perturbation model to this multi-scale surface

    description. We investigated the impact of this description on radar

    backscattering through a sensitivity analysis of backscattering

    coefficient to the multi-scale roughness parameters.

    To perform the inversion of the small perturbation multi-scale

    scattering model (MLS SPM) we used a multi-layer neural network

    architecture trained by backpropagation learning rule. The inversion

    leads to satisfactory results with a relative uncertainty of 8%.'
