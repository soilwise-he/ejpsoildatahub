    Amendment: Vermicompost'
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> Vermicompost, an enriched\
    \ compost made by involving earthworms in the preparation process, is one of the\
    \ most important products in sustainable agriculture today. It has the potential\
    \ to promote significantly more plant growth than other composts, prevent soil\
    \ degradation, remediate it, and naturally improve overall soil health and quality.\
    \ It provides cultivators with numerous opportunities, not only in terms of social\
    \ and economic advancement, but also for maintaining and increasing the productivity\
    \ potential of agricultural land. The dynamic nutritional composition and soil-enhancing\
    \ properties of vermicompost are unmatched by any other available alternative."
