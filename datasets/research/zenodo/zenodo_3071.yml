  title: Deworming as a Measure of the Prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminths among
    Primary School Children in Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers State
  abstract: "The investigation was carried out in<br> selected public primary schools\
    \ in Bonny Local<br> Government Area of Rivers State. A total of 424 samples<br>\
    \ were collected from the study areas. Sample size was<br> determined using Taro\
    \ Yamane\u2019s formula for sample<br> size determination.178 samples were from\
    \ CS Bonny,<br> 126 samples were from GPS Abalamabie and 120<br> samples were\
    \ from CPS Finima. A self-structured<br> questionnaire was first administered\
    \ to the study<br> participants to obtain their basic biodata and duration of<br>\
    \ deworming. Zinc sulphate flotation technique was used<br> for isolation of parasites.\
    \ Data generated was analysed<br> using simple percentages.Results from GPS<br>\
    \ Abalamabie and CPS Finima were dewormed by the<br> Government and no helminth\
    \ was extracted, indicating a<br> zero prevalence of helminths in the schools\
    \ sampled. The<br> study shows that deworming plays a major role in the<br> fight\
    \ against helminthiasis among school children.<br> Therefore the need for Government\
    \ to continue with<br> routine deworming exercise to maintain the zero<br> prevalence\
    \ status of helminths among school children in<br> the study area."
