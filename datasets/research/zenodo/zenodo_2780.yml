  title: Characterizing The Spatial Variability Of Soil Properties And Crop Yield
    Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image And Ground-Based Data
  abstract: 'Site-specific management practices offer a strategy to optimize agronomic
    inputs if the causes for spatial and temporal variability in crop yield are understood,
    and can be related to one or more field properties. The objectives of this study
    are to: (i) determine the suitable methodology for predicting soil properties
    and crop yield at high-spatial-resolution by evaluating various machine-learning
    algorithms, and (ii) identify the relationships between crop yield, soil and topographic
    properties. The analyses will be based on four soil properties (soil organic carbon,
    potassium, soil cation exchange capacity and magnesium), and maize (<em>Zea mays</em>
    L.) yield data from a maize-soybean (<em>Glycine max</em>) rotation field in central
    Ohio, USA. Topographic properties including slope, aspect, roughness, terrain
    ruggedness index, topographic position index, and flow direction were derived
    from a high-spatial-resolution (1 m) digital elevation model data. Soil and vegetation
    indices were derived from a high-spatial-resolution (0.30 m) multispectral bare-soil
    aerial image. Soil properties were estimated at high-spatial-resolution by integrating
    field-collected soil samples, topographic properties, and spectral information
    (individual spectral bands and indices) derived from multispectral aerial image.
    Continuous maize yield estimates were then predicted by integrating aforementioned
    data.  Multiple linear regression (LM) and two machine-learning algorithms, including
    random forest (RF) and neural network (NN), were investigated to evaluate and
    identify the method that best characterized the relationships between bare-soil
    multispectral image, soil properties and crop yield. Comparison of models for
    estimating soil properties and crop yield demonstrated that soil organic carbon
    and crop yield can be predicted using bare-soil multispectral image with higher
    accuracy using the RF model. The LM model predicted soil cation exchange capacity
    and magnesium with higher accuracy, and NN performed better in estimating potassium.
    Based on the analyses of importance of variables across the three models for maize
    yield prediction, variables including red and green spectral bands, and soil indices
    derived from bare-soil multispectral image, and cation exchange capacity were
    found to be the five most significant predictors influencing maize yield estimates.'
