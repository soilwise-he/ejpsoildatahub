  title: "A New Inhibitor of \u03B3-aminobutric Acid Aminotransferase from Streptomyces\
    \ sp. ZZ035 Isolated from a Folk Medicinal Soil in China"
  abstract: "Strain ZZ035 was isolated from a folk medicinal soil in China. Polyphasic\
    \ taxonomy procedure indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces\
    \ and was closest to S. cinnamonensis with high similarities (99.2%) of 16S rDNA\
    \ sequence. 1 was isolated from the broth of this strain and identified as 5-amonimethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine-4-carboxylic\
    \ acid. Its chemical structure was established by its spectroscopic data, and\
    \ 1H and 13C signals were assigned by its 1H, 13C, Dept and HSQC spectra. Considering\
    \ that 1 was a \u03B3-aminobutric acid (GABA) derivative, its inhibitory activity\
    \ against GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) was assayed, and the result showed that\
    \ 1 can inhibit GABA-AT activity with the 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately\
    \ 60 \u03BCM. As 1 was a 2,3-disubstituted GABA derivative not published before,\
    \ the approximate GABA-AT inhibitory activity of 1 compared to positive control\
    \ vigabatrin showed that 1 were worthy of further research and developing.Read\
