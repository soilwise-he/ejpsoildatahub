  title: 'Experiment Report: Soil Grain Size Analysis'
  abstract: Grain size analysis is conducted to determine the particle grain size
    present in a soil sample. The grain analysis is expressed as a percentage of the
    total dry weight. The most commonly used methods include sieve analysis and hydrometer
    analysis. This report presents a particle size analysis to determine the percentage
    of grain sizes in a soil sample in accordance with the ASTM standards. The experiment
    report concludes a sample analysis uniformly distributed after being passed through
    Unified soil grading criteria. The experiment errors are assumed to be negligible
    due to the small discrepancy in the two test results. The report objectives include
    acquiring the distribution of soil particles in the sample and producing data
    with errors less than the acceptable 2% and generating a semi-logarithmic plot.
    The semi-logarithmic plot displays the distribution of particle sizes of the soil
    and identifies the soil grading with the use of the graph data points.
