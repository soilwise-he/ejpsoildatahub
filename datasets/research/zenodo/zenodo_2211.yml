  title: Monitoring soil creep landsliding in an urban area using persistent scatterer
    interferometry (El Papiol, Catalonia, Spain)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil creep is characterised by slow displacement, with depths
    of a few meters and loosely defined limits. Buildings and infrastructure located
    on slopes affected by such landslides may suffer significant damages if their
    foundations are poorly dimensioned. The presence of soil creep in urban areas
    makes it necessary to develop landslide activity maps, derive hazard maps, and
    implement risk management plans. Even though both geological and geomorphological
    analyses can provide basic information, it is often necessary to use additional
    techniques to obtain information about ground displacements. This paper proposes
    a method to derive a soil creep activity map using a multi-approach analysis based
    on geological, geomorphological, and persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)
    data. PSI is a satellite-based technique to estimate land displacement velocity.
    The work described in this paper was carried out in the town of El Papiol, in
    the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). This is an urban area that has been
    heavily affected by soil creep over the past decades. The results achieved show
    that PSI data substantially improve the information provided by the geological
    and geomorphological analyses and make it possible to accurately define the landslide
    area and estimate its activity.&lt;/p&gt;'
