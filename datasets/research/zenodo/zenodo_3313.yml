  title: Soil Less Farming With Industry 4.0
  abstract: "An Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for soil-less farming systems\
    \ using Industry 4.0 is introduced. The architecture emphasizes the control of\
    \ water quality in distributed soil-less food production systems by adhering to\
    \ Industry 4.0 standards. Soil less agriculture can be defined as growing plants\
    \ in the greenhouse system in solid environments other than soil which is enriched\
    \ in nutritional solutions. There are two types of soil less agriculture 1) Hydroponics\
    \ \u2013 which grows plants in water 2) Aerologics - which grows plants in air.\
    \ Soilless cultivation is highly used in protected agriculture to improve control\
    \ over the growing environment and to avoid uncertainties in the water and nutrient\
    \ status of the soil. Industry 4.0 is the current trend of data exchange and automation\
    \ in manufacturing industrial technologies. Industry 4.0 is a combination of cyber-physical\
    \ systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry\
    \ 4.0 is also referred as the fourth industrial revolution. Although, it has been\
    \ applied for monitoring soil-less farming, where cyber physical system is used\
    \ to control the water nutrients which highly supports to grow plants. Cognitive\
    \ computing can help soil less farming to identify risks and frauds. It analyses\
    \ information to predict water, nutrients using Naive Bayes Algorithm. The acquired\
    \ data can be stored in cloud for future reference."
