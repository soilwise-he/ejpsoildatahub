  title: Parametric study to evaluate the performance of horizontal drains as mitigation
    technique against soil liquefaction
  abstract: 'In the framework of the LIQUEFACT project a series of centrifuge tests
    were conducted at ISMGEO (Italy) to verify the effectiveness of three mitigation
    techniques against soil liquefaction. This paper is focused on the study of horizontal
    drains as mitigation measure against liquefaction. The centrifuge layout with
    horizontal drains was numerically modelled and the change of boundary conditions
    reproduced by the FE code Plaxis 2D. Additionally, slightly different layouts
    from those tested in the centrifuge were also modelled to expand the scope of
    the experimental work. Horizontal drains were installed in the model, to analyse
    their effectiveness in reducing the pore pressure build up as a function of their
    spacing. The soil was characterized by an advanced coupled soils constitutive
    model implemented in the Plaxis code: PM4sand. The input parameters for the model
    are evaluated on the basis of both laboratory element tests and centrifuge tests.
