  title: Investigation of soil properties and nutrients in agricultural practiced
    land in Tangail, Bangladesh
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study investigated on soil nutrients in agriculture practiced
    high, medium high, medium low and low land at Kalihati upazila of Tangail district
    during October 2017 to June 2018. Thirty soil samples were collected from different
    land types at the study area and analyzed at Soil Resource Development Institute
    (SRDI) to determine soil nutrient status. The soil parameters under investigation
    included pH, organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P),
    available zinc (Zn), available iron (Fe), available manganese (Mn), available
    boron (B), exchangeable potassium (K), exchangeable calcium (Ca) and exchangeable
    magnesium (Mg). Results indicated that many of the soil nutrient levels decreased
    such as pH (5.63 to 6.40), P (3.50 to 23.20 &mu;g g-1), Zn (3.27 to 3.60 &mu;g
    g-1), Mn (21.12 to 57.90 &mu;g g-1), B (0.17 to 0.60 &mu;g g-1), K (0.18 to 0.30
    meq 100g-1) and Ca (5.75 to 9.10 meq 100g-1). On the contrary, the average content
    of OM (2.30 to 1.40%), Fe (248.22 to 161.10 &mu;g g-1) and Mg (2.07 to 1.80 meq
    100g-1) were increased. Total N content status did not change much (0.12%). Soil
    nutrients like those that available Zn, Fe, Mn and Mg contents were found above
    optimum level (very high) but OM and N status found below optimum level (low,
    very low and medium). Nutrient concentrations below optimum levels may limit crop
    yield. Updated knowledge about soil nutrient status needs to be provided for the
    farmers so that they can use necessary amount of fertilizers and avoid applying
    excess amount of fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;'
