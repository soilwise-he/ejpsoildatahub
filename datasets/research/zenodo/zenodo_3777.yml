  title: Utilization Of Sugarcane Ash &amp; Waste Paper Sludge Ash In Stabilization
    Of Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: "In the present scenario, urbanization and industrialization increases,\
    \ generates huge quantity of waste which leads to landfill depletion, soil contamination\
    \ and many hazardous effects. Hence the main aim of this study is to utilize this\
    \ industrial waste for improving the soil property by soil stabilization technique.\
    \ Sugarcane Ash is the by-product of Sugar Industry and Waste Paper Sludge comes\
    \ out from Paper Industry. To prove effectiveness of this waste, various laboratory\
    \ tests were carried out (viz. Atterberg\u2019s Limit, Compaction test, California\
    \ bearing Ratio, Unconfined Compressive Strength) on different soil sample blended\
    \ with different percentage of Sugarcane Ash and Waste Paper Sludge Ash. From\
    \ the results it has been observed that both ashes not only improved the property\
    \ of soil but also helps to reduce environmental issues"
