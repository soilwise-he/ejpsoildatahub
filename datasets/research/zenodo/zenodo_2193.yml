  title: Evaluation of biostimulation, bioaugmentation, and organic amendments application
    on the bioremediation of recalcitrant hydrocarbons of soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In the present work, the operational conditions for improving
    the degradation rates of Total&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/petroleum-hydrocarbon"&gt;Petroleum
    Hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(TPHs) in contaminated soil from a machinery park
    were optimized at a&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/microcosm"&gt;microcosms&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;scale
    along a 90-days incubation period. In this study, bioremediation strategies and
    an organic amendment have been tested to verify the remediation of soil contaminated
    with different hydrocarbons, mineral oils, and heavy metals. Specifically, designed
    biostimulation and&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bioaugmentation"&gt;bioaugmentation&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;strategies
    were compared with and without adding vermicompost. The polluted soil harboring
    multiple contaminants, partially attenuated for years, was used. The initial profile
    showed enrichment in heavy linear alkanes, suggesting a previous moderate weathering.
    The application of vermicompost increased five and two times the amounts of available
    phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K), respectively, as a direct consequence
    of the organic amendment addition. The&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/microbial-activity"&gt;microbial
    activity&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;increased due to&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-acidification"&gt;soil
    acidification&lt;/a&gt;, which influenced the solubility of P and other micronutrients.
    It also impacted the predominance and variability of the different microbial groups
    and the incubation, as reflected by&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phospholipid"&gt;phospholipid&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;fatty
    acid (PLFA) results. An increase in the alkaline&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phosphatase"&gt;phosphatases&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and
    proteases linked to bacterial growth was displayed. This stimulation of microbial
    metabolism correlated with the degradation rates since TPHs degradation&#39; efficiency
    after vermicompost addition reached 32.5% and 34.4% of the initial hydrocarbon
    levels for biostimulation and bioaugmentation, respectively. Although Polycyclic
    Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were less abundant in this soil, results also decreased,
    especially for the most abundant, the&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phenanthrene"&gt;phenanthrene&lt;/a&gt;.
    Despite improving the degradation rates, results revealed that recalcitrant and
    hydrophobic petroleum compounds remained unchanged, indicating that mobility,
    linked to&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bio-availability"&gt;bioavailability&lt;/a&gt;,
    probably represents the limiting step for further soil recovery.&lt;/p&gt;'
