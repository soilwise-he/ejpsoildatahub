  title: Evaluation of Seismic Behavior of Tube in Tube Braced Structural System Considering
    Soil-Structure Interaction
  abstract: The tube in tube structures is the innovative and fresh concept in the
    tubular structures. The tube in tube structures is especially suitable for all
    tall buildings. Bracing and shear wall are best concepts in a structure analysis
    of seismic force-resisting systems. Bracing and shear wall provide as additional
    lateral resistance against the lateral force. In the proposed study, tube structures
    of different heights have been considered. Bracing has been installed at corner
    along the structure's height and without bracing also meanwhile, shear wall provides
    in central core. Soil structure interaction (SSI) has also been taken into account.
    The parameters, such as maximum Story displacement, base shear, story drift, and
    story shear have also been studied. A tube-in-tube structure has been modelled
