  title: 'Soil Carbon Stocks in Long Term Organic Crop Production System: Dynamics,
    Relationships and Prospects'
  abstract: "Quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as indices of soil\
    \ health, crop productivity and environmental sustainability necessitates the\
    \ conduct of this research. A three-year field experiment was established to evaluate\
    \ the dynamics, relationships and prospects of soil carbon storage under organic\
    \ crop production system. The experiment involved four studies in Randomized Complete\
    \ Block Design with two factors replicated thrice. Factor A for the various studies\
    \ included corn, leafy vegetables, root vegetables and fruit vegetables. Factor\
    \ B comprised of liquid organic amendments such as fish amino acid (FAA), fermented\
    \ plant juice (FPJ), vermi tea and formulated organic fertilizer (FOF) which were\
    \ submitted to the laboratory for nutrient analysis. Recommended management practices\
    \ for the production of various crops were followed. Crop yield data were recorded.\
    \ Composite soil samples were processed and brought to the Soils Laboratory for\
    \ analysis of soil pH, % organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus\
    \ and exchangeable potassium. After two croppings, there was a declining trend\
    \ in SOC of plots grown with corn, leafy, root and fruit vegetables applied with\
    \ organic amendments. Among the soil chemical properties, pH, available P and\
    \ exchangeable K were found to be significantly correlated to corn yield. Best\
    \ fitted regression equation to estimate corn yield is given as: Yield <sub>(corn)</sub>\
    \ = 15.19 + (-1.45*pH) + (-0.06*P) + (-0.01*K), R<sup>2</sup>=0.5528. Soil organic\
    \ carbon was found to be significantly correlated with soil pH, available P and\
    \ exchangeable K. Application of FOF resulted to the highest SOC accumulation\
    \ rate (\u2206C=2.07 t/ha/yr) and shortest year (PY=22.52 yrs) to achieve potential\
    \ SOC pool for corn; leafy vegetables (\u2206C=3.29 t/ha/yr; PY=14.13 yrs) and\
    \ fruit vegetables (\u2206C=2.65 t/ha/yr; PY=17.58 yrs). For root vegetable production,\
    \ application of FAA showed the highest SOC accumulation rate (\u2206C=4.72 t/ha/yr)\
    \ and shortest year to achieve potential SOC pool (PY=9.86 yrs)."
