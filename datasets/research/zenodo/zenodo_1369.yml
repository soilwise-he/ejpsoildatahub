  title: SOIL BIOTECHNOLOGY TO TREAT NAZAFGARH DRAIN WATER BEFORE DISPOSAL INTO RIVER
    YAMUNA
  abstract: The potential risks associated with the use of recycled water have become
    a matter of concern for many organisations which are recycling water. Out of the
    many reasons, the major ones are that they are not able to maintain the efficiency
    of the treatment plant and to meet the high energy demand of these plants. These
    problems have led to restricted usage of treatment plants by the industries hence
    they allow the waste water to bypass directly into the natural water bodies without
    any treatment. This work has taken into consideration the issue of river Yamuna
    in Delhi, which is one of the most polluted rivers of the world. It has been identified
    that Nazafgarh drain located in west Delhi has got a major contribution in the
    polluting Yamuna. The need of the hour is to find an innovative solution to resolve
    the problem of water recycling and offer a platform to the industries where the
    burden of treating their factory effluents is taken care of. This paper proposes
    a 1 MLD water treatment plant based on Soil Biotechnology which can efficiently
    treat the Nazafgarh drain water and make it fit for disposal into Yamuna. SBT
    is an eco-friendly and sustainable technology developed at IIT Bombay which provides
    all levels of treatment in a single evergreen set up open to atmosphere which
    is odorless, cheap, simple to operate, easy to maintain and could be set up within
    the area of habilitation.<br>
