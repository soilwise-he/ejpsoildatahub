  title: Effects of cultivating a rice crop under aerobic conditions with film mulching
    on soil microbial activity
  abstract: This article 'Effects of cultivating a rice crop under aerobic conditions
    with film mulching on soil microbial activity' appeared in the International Rice
    Research Notes series, created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
    to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development of improved
    technology for rice and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help
    scientists keep each other informed of current rice research findings. The concise
    scientific notes are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one
    another to obtain details on the research reported.
