  title: 'ALUMINUM WASTE CANS RECYCLING IN LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA: ANALYSIS OF SOIL
    AND WATER BENEFITS'
  abstract: The study empirically evaluated the environmental (water and soil) benefits
    of aluminum waste cans recycling in Lagos State, Nigeria. Soil samples were collected
    from three locations using a soil auger the locations were aluminum at the recycling
    site, soil 100m away from the recycling site, and soil 150m away from the recycling
    site. From each location, three soil samples were collected and taken to the laboratory
    for analysis of soil physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents using
    standard methods. Similarly, a random sampling technique was employed to collect
    3 borehole water samples 100m away from the recycling site and 150m away from
    the recycling site using 750 millimeters of a SMART plastic container. The collected
    water samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis of heavy metals using
    standard methods. The results obtained revealed that high contents of physio-chemical
    properties of OC (2.96%), Ca (10.92 cmol/kg), Mg (0.77 cmol/kg), K (0.24 cmol/kg),
    Na (0.57 cmol/kg), exchange acidity (0.33 cmol/kg) and ECEC (12.46 cmol/kg) were
    found in soil 100m away from the recycling site. Also high content of Av. P (23.27
    mg/kg) was found in soil 150m away from the recycling. The contents of OC, P,
    Ca, Mg, K, and ECEC increase with distance away from the recycling site. No significant
    variations were found in the contents of OC, TN, P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, ,Al and ECEC
    (p&gt;0.05). The content of Fe (223.87 mg/kg) was found to be high at the aluminum
    waste cans recycling site (discharge point) and low in soil 150m away from the
    recycling site while high Mn (2.62 mg/kg) content was found in soil 150m away
    from the recycling site and low in soil 100m away from the recycling point. The
    contents of Fe, Mn, Pb,Cd and Zn were withwhomWHO maximum permissible level indicating
    low concentration in the soil. A negative and significant association was observed
    between Zn and Cd (rho = -0.812, p&lt;0.05). High Fe (259.18 mg/L), Pb (2.49 m,g/L)
    and Zn (16.01 mg/L) contents were found in the wastewater (discharge point), while
    high Mn (56.42 mg/L) content was found in the borehole water sample. The contents
    of Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn were the above WHO permissible limit. Based on the findings,
    the study concluded that the government should set up modalities to control the
    discharge of substances into the soil and water.
