  title: Experimental Study Of Geotextile Effect On Improving Soil Bearing Capacity
    In Aggregate Surfaced Roads
  abstract: 'Geosynthetics utilization plays an important role in the construction
    of highways with no additive layers, such as asphalt concrete or cement concrete,
    or in a subgrade layer which affects the bearing capacity of unbounded layers.
    This laboratory experimental study was carried out to evaluate changes in the
    load bearing capacity of reinforced soil with these materials in highway roadbed
    with regard to geotextile properties. California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test samples
    were prepared with two types of soil: Clayey and sandy containing non-reinforced
    and reinforced soil. The samples comprised three types of geotextiles with different
    characteristics (150, 200, 300 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and depths (H= 5, 10, 20, 30,
    50, 100 mm), and were grouped into two forms, one-layered and two-layered, based
    on the sample materials in order to perform defined tests. The results showed
    that the soil bearing characteristics increased when one layer of geotextile was
    used in clayey and sandy samples reinforced by geotextile. However, the bearing
    capacity of the soil, in the presence of a geotextile layer material with depth
    of more than 30 mm, had no remarkable effect. Furthermore, when the two-layered
    geotextile was applied in material samples, although it increased the soil resistance,
    it also showed that through the addition of a number or weights of geotextile
    into samples, the natural composition of the soil changed and the results are
    unreliable.'
