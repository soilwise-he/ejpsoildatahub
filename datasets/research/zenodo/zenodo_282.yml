  title: "Soil organic carbon stock on the Majorca Island: Temporal change in agricultural\
    \ soil over the last 10\u202Fyears"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For quite a long time, soil organic carbon stock
    (SOCS) has reduced from reconverting forest areas into agricultural land or by
    inadequate agronomic practices. However in recent decades in Mediterranean areas,
    abandonment of agricultural areas due to lack of economic profits and to promoting
    tourism has fostered a change in land use that has impacted soil carbon. In line
    with this, the Majorca Island (Spain) could be a good study area to evaluate temporary
    changes in carbon stocks in soils in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The present
    study analysed the spatial distribution of SOCS and evaluated the temporal changes
    over 11 years in agricultural soils in relation to the influence of land use and
    land management&rsquo;. The global carbon budget (estimated at 30 cm depth) on
    the Majorca Island was estimated at 31.23 Tg C, and showed wide spatial variability.
    As expected, SOCS was higher in the forest areas of the Tramuntana Mountain Range,
    while the lowest contents were found in agricultural use, located &lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;mainly
    in the centre and south of this&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The total C stored from 2006 to 2017 increased by 2.62 Tg
    C (15%) in agricultural areas on the &lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;island. We
    noted a major increase in SOCS in the agricultural zones on mountain slopes (&gt;
    2-fold higher), associated with abandoned crops in terrace cultivation, but grassland
    systems also increased. Nonetheless, the present study shows a sharp drop in SOCS
    in the centre and south of this island. This decrease was more pronounced in annual
    crops (&minus;14.5%), which could be attributed to intensive soil management and
    increased irrigated land. Land abandonment has been indicated as the main potential
    to carbon sequestration in soil, but this potential for carbon sequestration is
    a finite process. Certain changes in agricultural practices on Majorca, and in
    rural Mediterranean areas in general, are necessary to avoid carbon loss in cropland
    soils. Adoption of conservation crop rotation, organic additions and reduced tillage
    techniques, can help increase SOC levels in rural Mediterranean areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
