  title: Implementation peat soil adsorbent &amp; variation of filter for reduce emission
    improvement from motor vehicle
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The use of fossil fuels in transportation equipment, especially
    motorized vehicles, will have an extraordinary effect on air pollution. Therefore,
    air pollution becomes very important problem today. The amount of percentage of
    air pollution from transportation sources in Indonesia is 70.5&nbsp;% CO, 18.34&nbsp;%
    HC, 8.89&nbsp;% NOx, 0.88&nbsp;% SOx, and 1.33&nbsp;% particulate matter. Given
    the danger of exhaust emissions, especially carbon monoxide which can cause death
    for humans who inhale it, therefore efforts are needed to control air pollution
    from motorized vehicles. There are several methods that can be used, one of which
    is to use adsorbents. Activated carbon can be used as an adsorbent. One alternative
    that can be applied as an adsorbent is peat soil-activated carbon which is abundant
    and easy to make as an adsorbent. By utilizing the abundant peat-soil which is
    a great potential area of Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;In this experimental study; model l has a diameter of 20&nbsp;mm, model
    2 has an outside diameter of 20&nbsp;mm and an inside diameter of 10&nbsp;mm,
    and model 3 is without adsorbent. The length of this model is the same. Testing
    with a 2005 Honda Kharisma motor vehicle with an engine speed of 1000, 2000, and
    3000&nbsp;rpm. CO and HC emission tests using a gas analyzer were carried out.
    Testing was also carried out using a dyno test to determine the engine performance
    of a motorcycle that was installed with an adsorbent on the exhaust gas. The results
    showed that peat soil adsorbents with perforated circle designs can reduce CO
    gas emissions by 55&nbsp;% compared to the others. Besides that, the use of peat
    soil adsorbents with hollow circle designs can also reduce HC gas emissions by
    3.51&nbsp;%. The results of the engine performance test showed that there was
    no significant effect of using this adsorbent on torque and power.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, peat soil adsorbents used to reduce exhaust emissions
    in motorized vehicles can be applied&lt;/p&gt;'
