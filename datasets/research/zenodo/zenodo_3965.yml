  title: Overview of Engineering Problems of Soil Compaction and Their Effects on
    Growth and Yields of Crops
  abstract: 'ABSTRACT


    Soil compaction constitutes serious engineering problems in agriculture that researchers
    have been contending with to proffer sustainable solution. This review work was
    carried out to contribute to the fixing of the problems. Effects of soil compaction
    have eaten deep and are adversely affecting the production of food and fibre throughout
    the world. Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, leading
    to increased density and reduction in soil pore space. Thus, physical structure
    of the soil finds it difficult to support and applied mechanical stress leading
    to loss of soil structural units, decrease in soil volume, increase in bulk density,
    decrease in porosity and reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Compacted
    soils have reduced available water capacity. The change in pore space restricts
    root growth, and the gas exchange necessary for plant growth. Compaction restricts
    infiltration of water, increasing runoff and erosion, leading to the loss of valuable
    nutrients. Soil strength, cone index, bulk density, porosity, moisture content,
    erosion and runoff, poor plant growth and yields are the major parameters used
    as indicators of soil compaction. The problems of soil compaction are a global
    concern. As farmers continue to till the soil for the purpose of food and fibre
    production to meet the need of growing world population; prevention and alleviation
    practices should be taken into consideration to avoid the negative effects of
    soil compaction. Farmers are advised to carry out precision traffic agricultural
    practice; planting of crops on soils with cone index more than 1.5 kPa should
    be avoided; deep tillage practices, normally called subsoiling should be carried
    out on soils confirmed to be compacted. Farmers are advised to cultivate cover
    crops; incorporation of organic matter into the soil; and practicing of mixed
    farming in order to alleviate soil compaction menace.'
