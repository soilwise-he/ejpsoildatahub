  title: Physico chemical analysis of soil samples from Sahur village, of Ashti Tahasil,
    dist Wardha
  abstract: The present study objectively conducted to analyze physico-chemical properties
    of soil sample of Sahur village. The study area was divided into four sampling
    stations to cover the whole farms of Sahur village Ashti tahsil comprehensively
    in the April 2020. During the study Moisture, pH, EC, Carbon, Calcium carbonate,
    TDS, Magnesium, Calcium, Nitrogen, Copper, Potassium and Phosphorous content,
    were analyzed. The study revealed that the pH of the soil samples ranged from
    7.70 to 8.4 and was on slightly alkaline side but within the limit of 6.5-8.5
    which is optimum for crops. EC values ranged from 0.4ms to 0.8ms. and indicating
    low salinity status of the soils. OC content ranged from 1.30% to 1.65% and all
    the samples were of medium rating. Available nitrogen ranged from 245 kg/ha to
    271kg/ha; available phosphorous ranged from 19.50kg/ha to 24.0 kg/ha and samples
    were nitrogen and phosphorous deficient. Potassium ranged from 445 kg/ha to 645
    kg/ha and samples were of medium rating except one sample of high rating with
    respect to potassium.
