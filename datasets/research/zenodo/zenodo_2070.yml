  title: Changes In Physical-Thermal Properties Of Soil Related To Very Shallow Geothermal
    Systems In Urban Areas
  abstract: 'In the near future the population living in urban areas is expected to
    increase. This worldwide trend will lead to a<br>

    high concentrations of infrastructures in confined areas, whose impact on land
    use and shallow subsurface must be<br>

    well evaluated.<br>

    Since shallow geothermal energy resource is becoming increasingly important as
    renewable energy resource, due<br>

    to its huge potential in providing thermal energy for residential and tertiary
    buildings and in contributing to reduce<br>

    greenhouse gas emission, the number of installed geothermal systems is expected
    to continue to rise in the near<br>

    future.<br>

    However, a leading question concerns the short and long-term effect of an intensive
    thermal use of the shallow<br>

    subsurface for heat generation, cooling and thermal energy storage. From an environmental
    and technical point of<br>

    view, changes on ground temperatures can influence the physical-thermal properties
    of soil and groundwater as<br>

    well as their chemical and biological features.<br>

    In this study the preliminary results of ITER Project are presented. This project,
    funded by European Union,<br>

    focuses on improving heat transfer efficiency of very shallow geothermal systems,
    as horizontal collector systems<br>

    or special forms (i.e. helix system), interesting the first 2 m of depth from
    ground level.<br>

    Given the heterogeneity of sedimentary deposits in alluvial plain and the uncertainties
    related to the estimation<br>

    of thermal parameters for unconsolidated material affected by thermal use, physical-thermal
    parameters (i.e.<br>

    moisture content, bulk density, thermal conductivity...) where determined in laboratory
    for sand, clay and loamy<br>

    sand samples. In addition, preliminary results from a field test site located
    within an urban area will be also shown.<br>

    The main aim is to improve our knowledge of heat transfer process in the soil
    body in order (i) to create a reference<br>

    database to compare subsequently the impact of temperature variations on the same
    properties and (ii) to provide<br>

    reliable data for model parameterization'
