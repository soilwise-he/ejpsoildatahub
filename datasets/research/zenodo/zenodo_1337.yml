  title: Effect Of Open Dumps On Some Engineering And Chemical Properties Of Soil
  abstract: Solid waste open dumps are sited indiscriminately in Nigeria and are always
    potential hazards to health and sources of groundwater pollution.  The study investigates
    the effects of three open dumps on some engineering and chemical soil properties,
    with soils of similar layering located about 40 meters away from the dump used
    as control. No regular trend was established on the distribution of the parameters
    along the soil strata.  In order to determine whether there are significant differences
    between the characteristics at different dumps and control soil layers, a statistical
    test of hypothesis was carried out.  The values of the specific gravity, plasticity
    index, maximum density, permeability, iron, lead and zinc were higher in the soil
    under the dumps than in the control.  The values of the liquid limits and the
    optimum moisture content were lower in the soil under the dump sites.  The results
    indicate the needs for proper site investigation before solid waste dumps are
    selected.
