  title: Growth and Yield Responses of Diverse Advanced Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Lines
    to Sodic Soil Conditions at the Coastal Region of Kenya
  abstract: 'In 2022 Kenya''s self-sufficiency in rice stood only about 12% despite
    the country having a substantial amount of land suitable for rice production.
    Majority of these potential areas are located in the two biggest irrigation schemes
    at coastal Kenya i.e. Bura and Tana with a combined arable land of 9,600 ha. In
    these irrigation schemes, sodic stress characterized by elevated pH and high exchangeable
    Na+ in the soil is one of key stressing factors affecting rice growth and yield.
    Most of the released varieties in the country are either susceptible to sodic
    conditions and / or do not have consumer preferred grain qualities leading to
    low adoption rate. The objective of this study was to screen and identify genotypes
    with a combination of both tolerance to sodic soil conditions and market preferred
    grain traits from a panel of 96 salt tolerant accessions. The plant materials
    were evaluated under sodic soil at the Tana irrigation scheme and non-sodic soil
    conditions at the Bura irrigation scheme in 2015 (Season 1) and 2016 (Season 2).
    Basmati370, an aromatic variety with long slender grains and BW196 a high yielding
    but non-aromatic variety were used as checks. Analysis of variance revealed that
    there was a significant effect of soil environment on alkali injury score (SES)
    and the yield. Moreover, grain yield had the highest coefficient of variation
    (62%) under sodic soil suggesting that the trait is a good indicator of tolerant
    genotypes. Cluster analysis of the 96 genotypes under sodic soil conditions revealed
    four Clusters (1-4), whereby Cluster 1 genotypes maintained high yield attributed
    to low SES score. Using principal component analysis we identified six genotypes
    in Cluster 1 that significantly contributed to variation in PC 1 and 2. From the
    pool of these six genotypes CSR 36 showed high grain yield and grain qualities
    similar to those of Basmati370. Hence, the genotype is recommended for further
    advancement and release for cultivation under sodic soil conditions in Kenya.
