  title: Mapping the response of volumetric soil water content to an intense rainfall
    event at the field scale using GPR
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a convenient tool for volumetric
    soil water content (VSWC) estimation in hydrological and agricultural studies.
    Although case studies have been widely carried out, little attention has been
    paid to subsoil moisture estimates. In this research, we investigated three-dimensional
    soil moisture variation down to a depth of 1&nbsp;m and the effect of rainfall
    events on spatial soil moisture dynamics. GPR surveying lines were conducted both
    before and after a heavy rainfall event to map the VSWC. Soil sampling and time
    domain reflectometry (TDR) probe data at different depths (20, 40, 60, 80, and
    100&nbsp;cm) were acquired. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant
    correlation between the dielectric constants and VSWCs at all depths. The established
    relationships for the different depth ranges had a low VSWC discrepancy when the
    dielectric constants ranged from 10 to 15. The effective range of each variogram
    was larger than 20&nbsp;m, except for that of the 0&ndash;100&nbsp;cm VSWC map
    after rainfall. In addition, the validation diagrams using corrected TDR values
    demonstrated relatively reliable VSWC maps. Approximately 89% of the variation
    in VSWC could be explained by the dielectric constants in the depth range of 0&ndash;40&nbsp;cm,
    and VSWC predictions at this soil depth outperformed those at other depth ranges,
    with an overall RMSE of 0.027&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;&minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;and
    R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;of 0.725. Furthermore, we also monitored the effect
    of precipitation on the accuracy of the VSWC prediction on shallow surfaces. Our
    study shows that three-dimensional soil moisture dynamics can be accurately estimated
    at the field scale by integrating GPR interpretation and spatial extrapolation
    methods.&lt;/p&gt;'
