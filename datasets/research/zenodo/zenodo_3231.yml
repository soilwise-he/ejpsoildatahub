  title: The effects of fertilization with anaerobic, composted and pelletized sewage
    sludge on soil, tree growth, pasture production and biodiversity in a silvopastoral
    system under ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.)
  abstract: "In silvopastoral systems, tree growth and the composition and productivity\
    \ of pasture can be modified by management practices such as initial fertilization\
    \ when tree seedlings are more sensitive to understorey competition. The aim of\
    \ this study was to compare the effects of fertilization with different types\
    \ of sewage sludge (anaerobic sludge, composted sludge and pelletized sludge),\
    \ using different rates of incorporation and mineralization with traditional treatments\
    \ (with and without mineral fertilizers) on the growth of newly established ash\
    \ (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and on pasture development, to obtain sustainable management\
    \ practices\nthat enhance the growth of both components. Soil characteristics,\
    \ tree growth, sward \n omposition and pasture development were modified differently\
    \ according to the type of sewage sludge used, and for similar total nitrogen\
    \ inputs. Anaerobic sludge had a higher\ninitial effect on both tree and pasture\
    \ productivity. Pelletized sludge sustained better tree and pasture production.\
    \ Composted sludge was found to be the most appropriate treatment for improving\
    \ soil characteristics over the long term on sandy soils. It was concluded that\
    \ pelletized sludge should be promoted because it enhances productivity, allows\
    \ for better nutrient  ecovery and is less costly to store and apply compared\
    \ with anaerobic sludge and composted sludge.\nNo toxic concentrations of Zn or\
    \ Cu were found in plants or in the soil despite higher \n oncentrations being\
    \ present in the applied sludge than in soil."
