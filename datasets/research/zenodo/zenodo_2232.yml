  title: ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTENT OF DISSOLUBLE FORMS OF Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd AND Pb IN
    SOIL
  abstract: "<strong>Purpose.</strong> To control the content of heavy metals to prevent\
    \ toxic effects on the environment. <strong>Methodology. </strong>Soil sampling\
    \ and its study were conducted in May 2019. Aqueous extract was used for the study,\
    \ which was analyzed immediately after its receipt. The method of inversion voltammetry\
    \ and photocolorimetry was used to determine the concentration of heavy metals\
    \ in soil extracts. The content of zinc (II), copper (II), cadmium (II) and lead\
    \ (II) ions was determined by the method of additives, the content of total iron\
    \ by the method of calibration graph. <strong>Scientific novelty.</strong> A study\
    \ of the content of heavy metal ions in the soil of some parts of Chernihiv region,\
    \ to determine the anthropogenic load (\u0422\u0420P, vehicles) on the soil cover.\
    \ <strong>Conclusions.</strong> In terms of the scale of impact on the environment,\
    \ thermal energy and motor transport occupy the first places. Emissions from thermal\
    \ power plant (\u0422\u0420P) and cars are mostly deposited on the ground. Soil\
    \ compounds bind heavy metal ions for a long time, preventing their migration.\
    \ The buffer capacity of the soil relative to metals depends on many factors:\
    \ soil composition, acidity, complexation processes, oxidation-reduction, sorption-desorption,\
    \ etc. The study of the content of heavy metals in soils is necessary to control\
    \ the state of the environment, protect it from pollution. Due to the man-caused\
    \ load, the soil in the surveyed areas has polyelement contamination. Studies\
    \ have shown that the content of heavy metals in soil samples does not exceed\
    \ the level of MPC of mobile forms.As a result of the calculation of the concentration\
    \ coefficient, it was found that zinc and cadmium are leached from the soil, and\
    \ copper, lead and iron (in most cases), on the contrary, accumulate. According\
    \ to the total pollution index, the studied soils belong to the category of hazardous\
    \ and extremely dangerous, which is explained by the proximity to the sources\
    \ of pollution - Chernihiv \u0422\u0420P and highway."
