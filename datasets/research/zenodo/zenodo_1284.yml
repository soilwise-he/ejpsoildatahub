  title: Chromatographic migration of cadmium and nickel in different soil types of
    India
  abstract: 'Department of Chemistry, University College, Thiruvananthapuram-695 034,
    Kerala, India<br> <em>E-mail:</em> tharapradeepkumar@yahoo.com<br> Former Head,
    Crop Production Division, Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod-671

    31 May 2010</em> Among heavy metal pollutants cadmium and nickel play major role
    In polluting environment. So there is a<br> long-term need to investigate the
    chromatographic migration of these biotoxic: heavy metals in soil. In the present
    work<br> the Investigator have chosen three typical profile soil samples of different
    soil types of India. The study Is about the<br> leaching stress and mobility pattern
    or cadmium and nickel In three selected soil types. Different extractants are
    used<br> to find out water soluble (water extractable), exchanseable (KNO<sub>3</sub>
    extradable), available (DTPA extractable) and fixed<br> (HNO<sub>3</sub> extraictable)
    amount of heavy metals in soil. Analysis of Ions was done using Atomic Absorption
    Spedrophotometer.<br> Interpretation of results showed that major portion of heavy
    metals are retained In the top horizon. It can cause long<br> term toxic effects
    in plants and animals. Nickel exhibited greater migration properties than that
    of cadmium. So It will<br> cause greater threat to ground water than that or cadmium.'
