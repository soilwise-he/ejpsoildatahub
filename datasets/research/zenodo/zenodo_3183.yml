  title: Roles of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) on Sandy Loam Soil pH, Organic Matter,
    Bulk Density, Water-Holding Capacity and Carbon Stock Under Humid Lowland Tropical
    Climatic Conditions
  abstract: 'Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.) trees planted in alley cropping
    or established<br>

    on fallowed farms by natural means contribute significantly to soil health and
    productivity by<br>

    influencing various soil properties. In this study, the effects of L. leucocephala
    (Lam.) on<br>

    sandy loam soil pH, organic matter content, bulk density, water-holding capacity
    and carbon<br>

    stock were investigated under humid lowland tropical climatic conditions in Papua
    New<br>

    Guinea (PNG). Soil samples were collected from 60 cm deep piths dug out from 1
    m and 2 m<br>

    away from the base of the legume trees. The control soil samples were collected
    from<br>

    adjacent grassland dominated by Imperata cylindrica (L.), 10 m away from the legume
    trees.<br>

    In all the piths, soil samples were collected from the 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm
    profiles. The<br>

    results showed presence of the legume trees acidifies the soil (lowers pH), lowers
    surface soil<br>

    organic carbon, improves the water holding capacity within the surface soils and
    helps<br>

    improve bulk density, ideal for root growth. Comparatively there was more carbon
    in the<br>

    surface soil of the grassland than under the legume trees. In most tropical regions,
    grasslands<br>

    are often set a blaze for various land uses and the high carbon content is a potent
    source of<br>

    CO<sub>2</sub> emission, contributing to the greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere.
    The low<br>

    carbon stock measured under the legume trees means reduced emission of CO<sub>2</sub>
    when burnt<br>

    and more benefits for the sandy loam soil. This study has implication for management
    of<br>

    sandy loam soil using L. leucocephala (Lam.) under humid lowland tropical climatic
    soil<br>

    conditions.'
