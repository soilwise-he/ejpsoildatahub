  title: Distribution of Selected Soil Nutrients in Aggregate Sizes of Soils Under
    Different Geologic Formations in Southeast Nigeria
  abstract: 'Soil nutrients which are major factors to crop yield and food security
    could be loss to erosion as a result of structural break down leading to water
    pollution and low crop yield. Soils of southeast Nigeria like others in the humid
    tropical area are prone to degradation and are low in nutrient status. Therefore
    the study was conducted in other to investigate the distribution of selected soil
    nutrients in aggregate sizes under different geologic formations namely Asu River
    Group (ARG), Coastal Plain Sand (CPS), Falsebedded Sand Stone (FBS) and Bende
    Ameki Group (BAG) in Southeast Nigeria. At a depth of 0-15 cm, three replicate
    soil samples were taken from each formation. Collected samples were air dried,
    crushed and sieved using 2 mm mesh, properly labelled and analysed using standard
    methods. Samples for aggregate stability were not crushed after air drying. Core
    samplers were also used to collect samples for bulk density determination. Wet
    sieving method was used in separating samples into different sieve sizes of 2,
    1, 0.5, and &lt; 0.25 mm respectively. The experiment which was analysed using
    ANOVA was laid in Randomised complete block design. Significant means were separated
    using LSD at 5 % probability. Result indicated significant (P &lt; 0.05) variations
    in soil nutrients with sieve sizes. Soil organic carbon ranged from 10.30 % in
    aggregate diameter of 2 mm to 13.90 % in 0.5 mm in Asu River Group, 5.30% in 2
    mm diameter to 12.30 % in &lt; 0.25 mm in Coastal Plain Sand, 8.80% in 2mm sieve
    to 13.50 % in &lt; 0.25 mm and in Falsebedded Sand and from 8.40 % in sieve of
    0.5 mm to 15.8% in &lt; 0.25 mm sieve size in Bende Ameki Group. Higher values
    of total nitrogen were noted in 0.5 and in &lt; 0.25 mm sieve sizes. Available
    phosphorus was significantly (P 0.25) was significantly higher in soils of Umuna
    (59.18%) under False bedded Sand Stone and least at soils of Obinze (26.27%) under
    Coastal Plain Sand and followed the order: FBS &gt;ARG &gt; BAG &gt; CPS. Result
    also showed that soil organic carbon had significant (P &lt; 0.05) positive relation
    with water stable aggregates WSA (r= 0.50), pH water (r= 0.53), total nitrogen
    (r=0.79), effective cation exchange capacity (r = 0.51) of the studied soils.'
