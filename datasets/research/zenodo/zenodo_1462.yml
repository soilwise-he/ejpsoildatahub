  title: Effect of Different Soil Types on Rice Seedling Infection Caused By Rhizoctonia
    solani
  abstract: This article 'Effect of Different Soil Types on Rice Seedling Infection
    Caused By Rhizoctonia solani' appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter
    series, created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary
    objective of this publication was to expedite communication among scientists concerned
    with the development of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping
    systems. This publication will report what scientists are doing to increase the
    production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and
    land scarce nations in the world.
