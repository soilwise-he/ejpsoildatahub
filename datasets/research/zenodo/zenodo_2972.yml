  title: 'Assessing Future Hydrological Impacts of Climate Change on High-Mountain
    Central Asia: Insights from a Stochastic Soil Moisture Water Balance Model'
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract (Preprint).&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;We use a new
    set of data available to compute 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;century climate
    impacts on the hydrology of 221 catchments in high-mountain Central Asia. For
    each of these subcatchments, a parsimonious steady state stochastic soil moisture
    water balance model was set up and the partitioning of available water from precipitation
    into runoff and evaporation computed for different climate futures using the Budyko
    framework. Climate change sensitivity coefficients are analytically derived for
    the first time using the total differential method. Relative changes in discharge
    for three future periods 2011&ndash;2040, 2041&ndash;2070, and 2071&ndash;2100
    were computed in relation to the baseline period from 1979&ndash;2011. For the
    baseline observation period, climate data from a global high-resolution climatology
    data set (CHELSA V21) were used to extract mean daily subcatchment-specific temperature
    and precipitation values. Data from the coupled model intercomparison project
    phase 6 (CMIP6) were used to compute catchment mean future climate data using
    4 GCM models with 4 scenario runs each. CMIP6 data were bias corrected with CHELSA
    V21 observation data. For the spatial distribution of soil parameters, different
    global products were utilized. The robustness of the soil water balance model
    results was assessed using a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in relation to
    variations of these soil parameters over typically observed ranges for each subcatchment.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;The analysis of climate change suggests increasing precipitation over
    the three periods (+4.44 %, +5.89 %, and +8.51 % relative increases in median
    total precipitation averaged over subcatchment and scenarios). Median values of
    temperatures changes between periods relative to the baseline are +1.33 &deg;C,
    +2.44 &deg;C, and +3.55 &deg;C. Results of the hydrological soil water balance
    model runs suggest a median increase of discharge of +4.71 %, +7.44 % and +10.87
    % for the corresponding periods. This is a strong indication of a wetter and hotter
    future in Central Asia, relative to today&rsquo;s hydroclimate. Modelling results
    suggest that decreasing contributions from glacier melt over the course of the
    21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;century will be offset by increases in discharge
    consistently throughout the region, despite increasing potential evapotranspiration.
    Increases in relative discharge will be most pronounced in the Afghan Murghab-Harirud
    basin and in the Amu Darya. Changes in precipitation characteristics in terms
    of frequency and event depth also indicate possible impacts on hydrological extremes
    which remains a heavily under researched topic in Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;'
