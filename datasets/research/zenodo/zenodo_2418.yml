  title: Radial variation in the wood properties of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
    grown on former agricultural soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The soil of former farmland greatly differs from forest soil,
    and significantly influences tree growth and development compared with other site
    factors. The effect may also be reflected indirectly in radial variability of
    wood. This study compared radial variation of wood density, compressive strength
    along the grain and static bending strength of wood of Scots pine trees growing
    on former farmland and forest soils. The analyses were conducted in eight mature
    pine stands. On the basis of the stand description, four stands were classified
    as growing on forest soil (L) and four as growing on former farmland soil (P).
    A total of 24 model trees were selected, twelve on each soil type. Analyses of
    wood properties were conducted along four axes from the cross sectional radius
    of the trees at breast height. Our analyses showed that radial variation in wood
    properties of Scots pine (from selected locations in Poland) growing on former
    farmland is similar to the variation among the control trees growing on forest
    soils. In both groups of trees, the lowest density and the lowest strength were
    in the pith (juvenile) zone. Wood with the highest density and greatest strength
    was located in the central part of the radius. Wood of Scots pine trees growing
    on former farmland soils in comparison to that of trees growing on forest soil
    was characterised by a statistically lower basic density, lower compressive strength
    along the grain and static bending strength.&lt;/p&gt;'
