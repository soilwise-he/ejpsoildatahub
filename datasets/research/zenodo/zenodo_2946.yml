  title: Effect of liming on the changes of different forms of potassium in an acid
    soil treated with N and K fertilizers

    : rumadas13@gmail.com <em>Manuscript received online 11 February 2014, revised
    03 March 2014, accepted 08 March 2014</em> A laboratory experiment was conducted
    to study the effect of liming on the transformation of different forms of potassium
    in a strongly acidic silty loam soil (pH 4.56) treated with nitrogenous and potassic
    fertilizers. Irrespective of treatments, liming initially decreased the water
    soluble and exchangeable K but increased the non-exchangeable K in soil. Water
    soluble K was significantly increased in limed soil throughout its incubation
    period, whereas it showed a decreasing trend in unlimed acid soil. Highest amount
    of exchangeable K was observed in acid soil after 90 days of incubation, whereas
    water soluble and non-exchangeable K were found to be highest in half and full
    limed soil respectively. Combined application of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer
    significantly increased the water soluble K. However exchangeable K was increased
    in sole potassium fertilizer treated system. Application of N along with K fertilizer
    influenced soil K fixation and release of K because of its antagonistic interaction
    between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> for the same fixing sites.'
