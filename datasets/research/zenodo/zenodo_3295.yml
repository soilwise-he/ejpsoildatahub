  title: Reviewing Soil Erosion In Greece
  abstract: 'Mitigating soil erosion, especially in Mediterranean

    countries such as Greece, is essential in order to maintain

    environmental and agricultural sustainability. In this paper, scientific

    publications related to soil erosion studies in Greece were reviewed

    and categorized. To accomplish this, the online search engine of

    Scopus was used. The key words were "soil", "erosion" and

    "Greece." An analysis of the published articles was conducted at

    three levels: i) type of publication, ii) chronologic and iii) thematic. A

    hundred and ten publications published in scientific journals were

    reviewed. The results showed that the awareness regarding the soil

    erosion in Greece has increased only in the last decades. The

    publications covered a wide range of thematic categories such as the

    type of studied areas, the physical phenomena that trigger and

    influence the soil erosion, the negative anthropogenic impacts on

    them, the assessment tools that were used in order to examine the

    threat and the proper management. The analysis of these articles was

    significant and necessary in order to find the scientific gaps of soil

    erosion studies in Greece and help enhance the sustainability of soil

    management in the future.'
