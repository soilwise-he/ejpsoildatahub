  title: Community structure of mesofauna in the light of qualitative and quantitative
    research on soil mites
  abstract: 'Research into structure and abundance of soil fauna communities should
    be based on material consisting of both qualitative and quantitative samples to
    provide reliable results. However, in practice it turns out that sometimes it
    is simply impossible to have both qualitative and quantitative samples. The study
    presents a comparative analysis of results obtained with qualitative and quantitative
    methods used in research into soil mites from the suborder Uropodina (Acari: Mesostigmata).
    The research was carried out in different regions of Poland. Both qualitative
    (sieving of soil and litter) and quantitative samples were collected in each of
    the examined ground plots. The results presented in the study show that zoocenological
    analysis based on both qualitative and quantitative samples gives similar results
    in the case of common and abundant species, and collecting 2 or 3 sievings in
    a given ground plot can be equivalent to large series of quantitative samples
    in faunistic research and monitoring of the environment. This stems from the fact
    that sieving of litter allow to obtain far more dense material than from quantitative
    samples. Due to the high density of sieving they contain more species and specimens,
    including specimens at different developmental stages found in the examined area.
    This type of sampling can be more efficient when the researcher needs a simple
    and fast method of collecting material for analysis, especially in the case of
    extensive research conducted in large areas, monitoring of changes in soil, as
    well as in taxonomic, biometric, biogeographical, and molecular research.'
