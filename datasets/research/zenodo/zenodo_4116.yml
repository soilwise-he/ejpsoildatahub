  title: Pemetaan Tingkat Bahaya Erosi Menggunakan Metode RUSLE (Revised Universal
    Soil Loss Equation) dan SIG di Sub DAS Kali Progo Hulu
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Kali Progo Hulu Sub-watershed is one of the areas that are vulnerable
    to erosion that lead to land degradation. The existence of the change of uncontrolled
    land management, high rainfall factor and slope steepness factor, are the parameters
    that trigger the erosion in this sub-watershed. Erosion is a process of releasing
    and transporting rock mass naturally from one place to another by a carrying force
    on the soil surface, which in actual acquisition of data in the field requires
    time, cost and energy. RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) is one of
    the erosion models that can be used to predict erosion by considering the parameters
    of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope gradient and length, crop management,
    and land conservation practices. This research aims to model erosion and map its
    vulnerability using the RUSLE method in Kali Progo Hulu Sub-watershed. The maps
    depicting the extent of erosion (EA) are determined by the RUSLE model using rainfall
    erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), length and slope factor (LS),
    vegetation management (C) and land conservation practices (P). Each factor is
    made in a thematic map and performed by spatial analysis using GIS that is scoring,
    overlay (with intersect tools), and by query (EA = R x K x LS x C x P) to formulate
    data analysis results into map of Erosion Risk Level. Based on the result of RUSLE
    erosion modelling in 2016, it was found that the erosion risk level in Kali Progo
    Hulu Sub-watershed was 178,432 Ton/Ha/year, of which 41.37% (13.019,930 Ha) of
    the total area was included in the category of &quot;Very Light&quot; erosion;
    9.54% (3.001,419 Ha) &quot;Light weight&quot;; 17.77% (5.593,480 Ha) &quot;Moderate&quot;;
    19.40 (6.104,411 Ha) &quot;Heavy&quot;; and 11.93% (3.754,301 Ha) &quot;Very Heavy&quot;.
