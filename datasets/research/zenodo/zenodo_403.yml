  title: EFFECTS OF MICROGRID REINFORCEMENT ON SOIL STRENGTH
  abstract: In geotechnical engineering geogrid materials are in use to reinforce
    the soil recently. When these materials are used together with the soil, the strength
    parameters of the soil increases. The usage of geogrids is also very profitable
    to improve the soil because the material is very economical, easy to apply and
    durable. Engineers needs some design parameters about this materials when used
    withsoils for geotechnical designs. Therefore, experimental studies that will
    enable these parameters to be determined are of great importance. In this study,
    triaxial compression tests were carried out under four different cell pressures(50,
    100, 150, 200 kPa) in labarotory by using microgrids, which showss similar functions
    with geogrid. Soil samples were prepared without microgrid, single layer microgrid,
    two layers microgrid and three layers microgrid and each of them were individually
    tested in triaxial compression. 2 mm aperture sized grid reinforcement configurated
    in 50*100 mm in silty soil triaxial specimen as in layer form of one to three.
    In the experimental study, it was determined that the strength values of the soil
    samples using geogrid were higher than those without geogrid. It was also found
    that the most efficient reinforcement was the use of two layers of microgrid.
    One of the important findings was taht with the use of microgrid reinforcement,
    the strength parameters of the soil could be increased by % 307.
