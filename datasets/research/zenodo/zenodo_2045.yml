  title: Investigation of soil properties and pesticide intensity in crop lands at
    Tangail region of Bangladesh
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted to investigate the soil properties and
    pesticide intensity in rice, banana and brinjal growing agricultural land of Delduar
    and Sakhipur upazila of Tangail district during July 2019 to June 2020. Forty
    five soil samples were collected from different crop land at the study area and
    analyzed in the Soil Resource Development Institute to determine the soil properties
    as pH, total organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P),
    available sulfur (S), available zinc (Zn), exchangeable potassium (K), exchangeable
    magnesium (Mg) and exchangeable calcium (Ca). However, pesticide used intensity
    was also evaluated through questionnaire survey with farmers and stakeholders
    in the study area. Results showed that pH, OM, available N, exchangeable Ca and
    exchangeable Mg content were significantly higher in rice growing land than banana
    and brinjal. On the other hand, available P, exchangeable K and available Zn content
    were substantially higher in brinjal growing land than rice and banana. The OM
    showed significant positive correlation with soil pH, available N, available S,
    exchangeable Mg and exchangeable Ca (r=0.37, 0.99, 0.31, 0.59 and 0.63, respectively),
    indicated rice growing land built up these soil properties through increasing
    soil OM. The available P showed significant and positive correlation with K and
    Zn (r=0.55 and 0.74, respectively), but negative correlation with exchangeable
    Mg and exchangeable Ca (r=-0.53 and -0.32, respectively). The exchangeable K showed
    significant and positive correlation with available Zn (r=0.45) but negative correlation
    with exchangeable Mg (r=-0.37). The Mg showed significant negative correlation
    with available Zn (r=-0.45) but positive correlation with exchangeable Ca (r=0.87).
    Results also revealed that pesticide used intensity was higher in brinjal followed
    by banana and minimum in rice crop. Study suggests that farmers require up-to-date
    information on soil nutrient status so that they may use the proper utilization
    of fertilizers and avoid using excessive amounts of fertilizers and pesticides
    in their crop land.&lt;/p&gt;'
