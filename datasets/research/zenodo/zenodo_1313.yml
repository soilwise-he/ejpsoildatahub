  title: Impact of Combined Stabilization on Strength and Hydraulic Properties of
    Subgrade Soil
  abstract: Gypseous subgrade soil provide suitable bearing strength when dry, however,
    it exhibits weak and collapsible behaviour when flooded with water. The strength
    and waterproofing properties can be enhanced by combined stabilization. An attempt
    has been made in the present investigation to implement hydrated lime and cutback
    asphalt as a combined stabilizing agents to reserve the strength and hydraulic
    properties of the subgrade soil. California bearing ratio test and unconfined
    compression test have been conducted for determination of the strength. However,
    constant head permeability and absorption test were conducted to evaluate the
    hydraulic properties. It was observed that the coefficient of permeability declines
    by (78.7 and 87.4) % and the water absorption decreased by (25 and 90) % after
    implementation of asphalt and combined stabilization processes respectively as
    compared to control gypseous soil. The unconfined compressive strength increases
    by 283 % as compared with asphalt stabilized soil. The combined and asphalt stabilized
    mixtures exhibits the highest load bearing capacity at 12 mm deformation when
    tested at unsoaked condition, while the load bearing capacity declines after soaking
    by (30.7 and 61.5) % for combined and asphalt stabilized mixtures respectively.<strong>
    </strong>Combined stabilization of gypseous soil with lime and cutback asphalt
    is recommended to enhance the strength and hydraulic properties of the subgrade.
