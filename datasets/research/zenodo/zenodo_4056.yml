  title: Impacts of Gas Explosion on Water and Soil Properties in Ikot Asute, Oruk
    Anam L.G.A., Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Impacts of gas explosion on water qualities and soil properties
    in Ikot -Asute, Oruk Anam L.G.A, Akwa Ibom State were studied. The aim was to
    establish baseline information on the impacts of gas explosion on water and soil
    properties.&nbsp; Soil samples were collected from three points and bulked to
    form composite sample at depth of 0-15 and 15-30 cm using soil auger within the
    vicinity of explosion and along the pipeline corridor. Also, soil samples were
    collected 300m away from the gas explosion vicinity to serve as control. A total
    of 7 composite soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Undisturbed
    soil samples were equally collected using core ring for the determination of permeability
    and bulk density.&nbsp; Rain and stream water were collected within the vicinity
    of explosion.&nbsp; The samples were properly bagged, labelled and taken to the
    laboratory for analysis. The study revealed that, in comparison with the control,
    gas explosion increased sand fraction, bulk density and reduced clay fraction,
    permeability and total porosity. Gas explosion reduced soil pH, soil organic matter,
    total N, available P, exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, Na and K), cation exchange capacity
    and raised electrical conductivity and exchangeable acidity. Gas explosion also
    increased the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni in the soil. Water qualities
    affected by gas explosion were temperature, pH, turbidity, chloride, Cd, Ni and
    Cr. These parameters were raised by gas explosion in the area. Therefore, gas
    explosion is responsible for the fast decline in soil and water qualities in the
    vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;'
