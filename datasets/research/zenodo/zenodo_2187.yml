  title: Structural Analysis of Stabilization and Consolidation Settlement of Selected
    Laterite Soil using Cement Lime and Butimen
  abstract: 'The problem confronting roads in Nigeria is increasing immensely. It
    is ranging from folding or deflection of road surface and cracking due to improper
    investigation, soil stabilization and consolidation. Soil stabilization is of
    great importance because it is used to improve on site materials to create a solid
    and strong sub base and base coarses. Unsatisfactory soil and solids structures
    which do not have the desired quality as an engineering material need stabilization
    so as to improve its engineering material for better construction. This work is
    aimed at determining structural analysis of stabilization and consolidation settlement
    of soil structure interaction. This is done to ascertain the effect of soil stabilization
    of selected laterite using cement, lime and bitumen. Liquid limit test, compaction
    test, Plastic limit test and California Bearing Ratio CBR test were conducted
    using comparing Mechanical, Chemical, Cement and Bio Enzymatic stabilization method.
    It was observed that Cement stabilization is the best option as it could effectively
    implemented in this work. Ohaofia soil that is treated with 10 ordinary Portland
    cement can be recommended to be used as Base coarse for road construction. This
    is because its mixture satisfies both the strength and durability requirement
    that were set by different agencies for the Base coarse materials. While for Isikwuato
    soil was treated with 8 bitumen is recommended for Road Sub base surface as it
    gave the highest CBR value. It is observed that Lime is not a good stabilizer
    for road construction, but the CBR value achieved met up required standard for
    Road and Bridges. Based on the various results obtained, it is recommended that
    utilization of the locally available soil should be given due consideration for
    upcoming road construction within the study area and Cement stabilization is more
    suitable for road construction. Onyeka, F. C "Structural Analysis of Stabilization
