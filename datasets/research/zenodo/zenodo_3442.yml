  title: IMPACT OF SOIL PARAMETERS ON WEATHER FORECASTS USING SOFT COMPUTING
  abstract: Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict
    the state of the atmosphere for a given location and they are made by collecting
    quantitative data of soil parameters. Soft computing is an innovative approach
    to construct computationally intelligent systems that are supposed to possess
    humanlike expertise within a specific domain, adapt themselves and learn to do
    better in changing environments, and explain how they make decisions. Soft computing
    techniques are Fuzzy logic, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithm
    etc. In this paper description about the soil and new technologies.
