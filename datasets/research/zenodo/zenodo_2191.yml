  title: Seismic Design and Comparative Study of RCC Building Over Flat Slab Building
    Under Different Soil Conditions
  abstract: "Precast concrete is a well-known method that uses certain factory-produced,\
    \ uniform parts to\_enable speedy building. The technology is still in use in\
    \ our country even though it was\_developed many years ago. We have gone through\
    \ a tonne of literature, carefully investigated\_a range of precast issues, and\
    \ gathered the pertinent information for our study. The large\_inventory\_of\_\
    reinforced\_concrete\_structures\_currentlyin\_use\_includes\_those\_with\_precast\_\
    components, which have been widely used since the 1950s primarily to satisfy manufacturing\_\
    and tertiary needs. Their widespread use has been facilitated by the economical\
    \ and effective\_construction method as well as the adaptability of the structural\
    \ net size. To assess the\_structure and design, a reference project at the Chennai\
    \ site is gathered and replicated using\_SAP2000 software."
