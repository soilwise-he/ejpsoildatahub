  title: Estimation On The Radiological Level Of Natural Occurring Radionuclides Present
    In Flooded Soil Samples In Kaduna North, Nigeria
  abstract: 'The background radiation of the areas was collected at random for each
    point using a rados survey meter. The detectors (two rados survey meter were used)
    were placed 1 meter above the ground with the operator positioned a few meters
    away. Three (3) readings were taking from each detector in other to reduce error
    or reach accuracy in obtaining the background readings from each randomly selected
    point where soil samples were later collected.


    In the current study, the concentration levels of naturally occurring radioactive
    materials (NORMs) of 40K, 232Th, and 238U in the surface soil samples of selected
    areas in kigo road new extension Kaduna north, Kaduna in Nigeria were studied.
    The collected soil samples were analyzed by means of gamma-ray spectrometry. The
    mean activity concentrations of the natural occurring radionuclides of  226Ra,
    232Th and 40K in the soil samples were estimated to be 62, 78.35, 227.17 Bq/kg
    respectively for kigo road new extension respectively. Radium equivalent activity,
    absorbed dose rate, annual effective dose equivalent were also calculated for
    assessment of radiological risk. External hazard value (Hex) is between 0.3163
    and 0.9557 and Internal hazard value is between 0.4462 and 1.1618. The worldwide
    average activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in soil samples from various
    studies around the world have values of 37, 30 and 400 Bq/kg respectively [UNSCEAR,
    2000]. The values compared well with published data from UNSCEAR shows Ra-226,
    Th-232 from the location are well above the standards while K-40 below the risk
    value.'
