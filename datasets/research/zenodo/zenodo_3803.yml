  title: Prediction Method Of Extenics Theory For Assessment Of Bearing Capacity Of
    Lateritic Soil Foundation
  abstract: Base on extenics theory, the statistical physical and mechanical properties
    from laboratory experiments are used to evaluate the bearing capacity of lateritic
    soil foundation. The properties include water content, bulk density, liquid limit,
    cohesion, and so on. The matter-element and the dependent function are defined.
    Then the synthesis dependent degree and the final grade index are calculated.
    The results show that predicted outcomes can be matched with the in-situ test
    data, and a evaluate grade associate with bearing capacity can be deduced. The
    results provide guidance to assess and determine the bearing capacity grade of
    lateritic soil foundation.
