  title: Spectrophotometric determination of mercury(II) in environmental, soil, medicinal
    and biological samples using 2-benzoylpyridine-4-methyl3-thiosemicarbazone (BPMT)

    \ Department of Chemistry, Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur-515 003,\
    \ Andhra Pradesh, India <em>E-mail </em>: khussainreddy@yahoo.co.in.com <em>Manuscript\
    \ received online 23 September 2013, revised 25 October 2013, accepted 28 October\
    \ 2013</em> Analytical and biological applications of 2-benzoylpyridine-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone\
    \ (BPMT) are reported for the first time. The reagent (BPMT) has been synthesized\
    \ and characterized by IR, NMR, and mass spectral data. BPMT reacts with mercury(II)\
    \ in slightly acidic medium (pH 6.0 sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer) to form\
    \ deep yellow coloured complex. The complex shows maximum absorbance at 410 nm.\
    \ The molar absorptivity and Sandell\u2019s sensitivity of the method are found\
    \ to be 4.7 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> L mol<sup>\u20131</sup> cm<sup>\u20131</sup> and\
    \ 0.0103 \xB5g cm<sup>\u20132</sup> of mercury(II). The composition of the complex\
    \ is found to be 1 : 1 (M : L). The method is successfully applied to a number\
    \ of environmental, biological, medicinal and soil samples. The results are comparable\
    \ with those obtained by dithizone method. The proposed system has high sensitivity,\
    \ accuracy and precision (s = 0.078 for 4 \xB5g/ml in BPMT method)."
