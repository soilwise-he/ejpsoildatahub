  title: 'Field scale biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons and soil restoration
    by Ecopiles: microbiological analysis of the process'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Ecopiling is a method for biodegradation of hydrocarbons in
    soils. It derives from Biopiles, but phytoremediation is added to biostimulation
    with nitrogen fertilization and bioaugmentation with local bacteria. We have constructed
    seven Ecopiles with soil heavily polluted with hydrocarbons in Carlow (Ireland).
    The aim of the study was to analyze changes in the microbial community during
    ecopiling. In the course of 18&thinsp;months of remediation, total petroleum hydrocarbons
    values decreased in 99 and 88% on average for aliphatics and aromatics, respectively,
    indicating a successful biodegradation. Community analysis showed that bacterial
    alfa diversity (Shannon Index), increased with the degradation of hydrocarbons,
    starting at an average value of 7.59 and ending at an average value of 9.38. Beta-diversity
    analysis, was performed using Bray-Curtis distances and PCoA ordination, where
    the two first principal components (PCs) explain the 17 and 14% of the observed
    variance, respectively. The results show that samples tend to cluster by sampling
    time instead of by Ecopile. This pattern is supported by the hierarchical clustering
    analysis, where most samples from the same timepoint clustered together. We used
    DSeq2 to determine the differential abundance of bacterial populations in Ecopiles
    at the beginning and the end of the treatment. While TPHs degraders are more abundant
    at the start of the experiment, these populations are substituted by bacterial
    populations typical of clean soils by the end of the biodegradation process. Similar
    results are found for the fungal community, indicating that the microbial community
    follows a succession along the process. This succession starts with a TPH degraders
    or tolerant enriched community, and finish with a microbial community typical
    of clean soils.&lt;/p&gt;'
