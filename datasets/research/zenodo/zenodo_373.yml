  title: Contribution of the Aboveground Biomass of Talahib, Saccharum spotaneum L.
    to Soil Fertility Amelioration of Lahar-laden Soil
  abstract: '<strong>Abstract</strong> This special project attempted to determine
    the contribution of the aboveground biomass of talahib to soil fertility amelioration
    of lahar-laden soil. This further quantified the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus
    and potassium that the grass species contributes to the improvement of soil fertility.
    Three quadrats, which measured 3m x 3m, were established in a grassland community
    at the Ramon Magsaysay Technological University (RMTU), San Marcelino, Zambales.
    Three grass species were found thriving in the area: talahib (Saccharum spontaneum),
    hagonoy (Chromolaena odorata) and Colopogonium sp. Among these, talahib yielded
    the highest mean biomass (dry weight) of 1,710 kg/ha followed by hagonoy with
    mean biomass yield of 100.9 kg/ha and Colopogonium sp with mean biomass of 50.9
    kg/ha. The highest yield in biomass of talahib is due to the fact that it has
    the ability to establish itself in harsh conditions such as offered lahar. Specifically,
    this may be attributed to the ability of species to withstand drought and extreme
    temperature, the presence of its extensive, deep penetrating room system, which
    can reach an average depth of 42cm and the presence of underground rhizomes or
    stems. Likewise, the computed Importance Value (I.V) of each species suggested
    that talahib is the most dominant and the most important species in the area.
    It has an Importance value of 91.84% followed by hagonoy and Colopogonium sp with
    Importance Values if 5.42% and 2.74%, respectively. Based on the tissue analysis
    conducted, it was found out that talahib contains 0.85% nitrogen, 0.15% phosphorus
    and 0.68% potassium which when translated into kilogram per hectare, the grass
    species can contribute an approximate amount of 150 kg Nitrogen, 130 kg Potassium
    and 30kg Phosphorus. This implies that talahib can help enhance the soil structure
    and fertility of lahar-laden soil.'
