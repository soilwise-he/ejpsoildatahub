  title: Effect of Vetiver Grass Headges in Maintaining Soil Fertility and Productivity
    at Anno Agro Industry Farm, Gobu Sayo District, Oromiya Region, Ethiopia
  abstract: Inappropriate farming system and utilization of natural resources are
    among the major causes for the current land degradation in Ethiopia. To control
    soil erosion cheap, replicable and sustainable conservation measures need to be
    implemented. The use of vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L.) makes a better
    option for soil erosion and sediment control and nutrient trapping in a wide range
    of environments. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of using
    vetiver grass in improving soil fertility and productivity through nutrient trapping.
    The study was conducted at Anno agro-industry where vetivar grass was being used
    for soil conservation purpose for more than one and half decade. Sample top soils
    (0-30 cm) from with and without vetiver grass adjacent area were collected in
    six replicates and important soil parameters such as bulk density, moisture content,
    CEC, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous and available
    potassium were determined. The study also involved growing maize crop for two
    months in plastic pots filled with soil sample from with and without vetiver to
    compare their productivity. Plant growth parameters such as days to emergence,
    plant height, leaf length, leaf numbers per plant, root and shoot dry and fresh
    weights and root to shoot ratio were used to evaluate the difference in the productivity
    of with and without vetiver grass soil. Soil bulk density, CEC, Organic Matter,
    Total Nitrogen, Available Phosphorous, and Potassium contents, were significantly
    higher for soil with vetiver than for without vetiver grass soil. The results
    revealed that the use of vetiver grass as a soil conservation practice improved
    soil fertility and productivity.
