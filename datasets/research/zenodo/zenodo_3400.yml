  title: The Effect Of Raindrop Kinetic Energy On Soil Erodibility
  abstract: 'Soil erosion is a very complex phenomenon, resulting<br>

    from detachment and transport of soil particles by erosion agents.<br>

    The kinetic energy of raindrop is the energy available for detachment<br>

    and transport by splashing rain. The soil erodibility is defined as the<br>

    ability of soil to resist to erosion. For this purpose, an experimental<br>

    study was conducted in the laboratory using rainfall simulator to<br>

    study the effect of the kinetic energy of rain (Ec) on the soil<br>

    erodibility (K). The soil used was a sandy agricultural soil of 62.08%<br>

    coarse sand, 19.14% fine sand, 6.39% fine silt, 5.18% coarse silt and<br>

    7.21% clay. The obtained results show that the kinetic energy of<br>

    raindrops evolves as a power law with soil erodibility.'
