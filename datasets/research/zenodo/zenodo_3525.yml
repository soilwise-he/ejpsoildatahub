  title: Heavy Metals In Soil And Vegetables And Their Effect On Health
  abstract: "The present study was carried out to assess heavy metals Cadmium (Cd),\
    \ Lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), Chromium (Cr) and Nickel (Ni) levels in vegetables\
    \ like Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis), Cabbage (Brassica oleracea),\
    \ Carrot (Daucus carota), Brinjal (Solanum melongena), Spinach (Spinacia oleracea)\
    \ and Radish (Raphanus sativus) irrigated with domestic wastewater. The vegetable\
    \ samples were randomly collected from the farmlands irrigated with domestic wastewater\
    \ around the Hisar district. Spinach, cabbage, brinjal and carrot accumulated\
    \ higher Cd (1.30\xB10.31 mg kg-1), Pb (4.23\xB10.32 mg kg-1), Cu (1.42\xB10.25\
    \ mg kg-1), Zn (3.4\xB10.28 mg kg-1), Cr (1.16\xB10.11 mg kg-1) and Ni (2.45\xB1\
    0.86 mg kg-1) respectively. Transfer Factor (TF) of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr and Ni\
    \ are more in spinach (0.0306), cabbage (0.4448), spinach (0.2642), cauliflower\
    \ (0.2494), carrot (0.0764) and spinach (0.7469) respectively. The health risk\
    \ assessment has been calculated followed by Estimated Daily Intake Metal (EDIM)\
    \ and Estimated Health Risk Index (EHRI). The present study highlights that both\
    \ adults and children consuming vegetables grown in wastewater irrigated soils\
    \ accumulate significant amount of these metals. However, the values of these\
    \ metals were lesser than recommended maximum tolerable levels proposed by the\
    \ FAO/WHO (1999)."
