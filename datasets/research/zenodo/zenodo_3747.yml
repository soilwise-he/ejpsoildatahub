  title: Application Of Micro-Tunneling Technique To Rectify Tilted Structures Constructed
    On Cohesive Soil
  abstract: "Foundation differential settlement and supported\nstructure tilting are\
    \ an occasionally occurred engineering problem.\nThis may be caused by overloading,\
    \ changes in ground soil properties\nor unsupported nearby excavations. Engineering\
    \ thinking points\ndirectly toward the logic solution for such problem by uplifting\
    \ the\nsettled side. This can be achieved with deep foundation elements\nsuch\
    \ as micro-piles and macro-piles\u2122, jacked piers, and helical piers,\njet\
    \ grouted mortar columns, compaction grout columns, cement\ngrouting or with chemical\
    \ grouting, or traditional pit underpinning\nwith concrete and mortar. Although,\
    \ some of these techniques offer\neconomic, fast and low noise solutions, many\
    \ of them are quite the\ncontrary. For tilted structures, with the limited inclination,\
    \ it may be much\neasier to cause a balancing settlement on the less-settlement\
    \ side\nwhich shall be done carefully in a proper rate. This principal has been\n\
    applied in Leaning Tower of Pisa stabilization with soil extraction\nfrom the\
    \ ground surface. In this research, the authors attempt to\nintroduce a new solution\
    \ with a different point of view. So, the\nmicro-tunneling technique is presented\
    \ in here as an intended ground\ndeformation cause. In general, micro-tunneling\
    \ is expected to induce\nlimited ground deformations. Thus, the researchers propose\
    \ to apply\nthe technique to form small size ground unsupported holes to produce\n\
    the target deformations. This shall be done in four phases: 1.\nApplication of\
    \ one or more micro-tunnels, regarding the existing\ndifferential settlement value,\
    \ under the raised side of the tilted\nstructure. 2. For each individual tunnel,\
    \ the lining shall be pulled out\nfrom both sides (from jacking and receiving\
    \ shafts) in the slow rate.\n3. If required, according to calculations and site\
    \ records, an additional\nsurface load can be applied on the raised foundation\
    \ side. 4. Finally, a\nstrengthening soil grouting shall be applied for stabilization\
    \ after\nadjustment. A finite element based numerical model is presented to simulate\n\
    the proposed construction phases for different tunneling positions and\ntunnels\
    \ group. For each case, the surface settlements are calculated\nand induced plasticity\
    \ points are checked. These results show the\nimpact of the suggested procedure\
    \ on the tilted structure and its\nfeasibility. Comparing results also show the\
    \ importance of the\nposition selection and tunnels group gradual effect. Thus,\
    \ a new\nengineering solution is presented to one of the structural and\ngeotechnical\
    \ engineering challenges."
