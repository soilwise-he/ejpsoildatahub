  title: Effect of no-till followed by crop diversification on the soil microbiome
    in a boreal short cereal rotation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Diversification of agricultural practices, including changes
    in crop rotation, intercropping or cover cropping, influence the soil microbiome.
    Here the impact of tillage and crop diversification on the soil microbiome is
    reported, being one of the few boreal studies. The field experiment consisted
    of four treatments with four replications all having a short cereal rotation practice
    namely an oat (&lt;em&gt;Avena sativa&lt;/em&gt;) &ndash; spring barley (&lt;em&gt;Hordeum
    vulgare&lt;/em&gt;) &ndash; wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt;) rotation
    for the past 10&nbsp;years until spring 2018. During that period two of the treatments
    were conventionally tilled with moldboard ploughing whereas the other two were
    no-tillage treatments. From the growing season 2018 until fall 2020 the main crop
    in all treatments was spring barley. The first conventional tillage treatment
    was diversified with English ryegrass (&lt;em&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/em&gt;) as
    an undersown cover crop for the next three growing seasons. The first no-tillage
    treatment continued with spring barley only. The second conventional tillage and
    no-tillage treatment had winter rapeseed in rotation in 2019. Bulk soils were
    sampled in May 2018 before diversification and then in October 2018, 2019, and
    2020. The results showed a clear effect of tillage on the beta-diversity of the
    soil microbiome and an increase in fungal richness. Barley monoculture interrupted
    with winter rapeseed resulted in a minor change of the fungal and bacterial community
    composition. Other fungal and bacterial alpha diversity measures did not react
    to tillage or diversification nor did the gene copy abundances involved in the
    N cycle. In conclusion tillage had a profound effect on the soil microbiome hindering
    impact of the diversification.&lt;/p&gt;'
