  title: "Evaluation of a MetOp ASCAT\u2010Derived Surface Soil Moisture Product in\
    \ Tundra Environments"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Satellite-derived surface soil moisture data are available for
    the Arctic, but detailed validation&lt;br&gt;

    is still lacking. Previous studies have shown low correlations between in situ
    and modeled data. It is&lt;br&gt;

    hypothesized that soil temperature variations after soil thaw impact MetOp ASCAT
    satellite-derived surface&lt;br&gt;

    soil moisture (SSM) measurements in wet tundra environments, as C band backscatter
    is sensitive to&lt;br&gt;

    changes in dielectric properties. We compare in situ measurements of water content
    within the active layer&lt;br&gt;

    at four sites across the Arctic in Alaska (Barrow, Sagwon, Toolik) and Siberia
    (Tiksi), taken in the spring after&lt;br&gt;

    thawing and in autumn prior to freezing. In addition to the long-term measurement
    fields, where sensors&lt;br&gt;

    are installed deeper in the ground, we designed a monitoring setup for measuring
    moisture very close&lt;br&gt;

    to the surface in the Lena River Delta, Siberia. The volumetric water content
    (VWC) and soil temperature&lt;br&gt;

    sensors were placed in the moss organic layer in order to account for the limited
    penetration depth of&lt;br&gt;

    the radar signal. ASCAT SSM variations are generally very small, in line with
    the low variability of in situ&lt;br&gt;

    VWC. Short-term changes after complete thawing of the upper organic layer, however,
    seem to be mostly&lt;br&gt;

    influenced by soil temperature. Correlations between SSM and in situ VWC are generally
    very low, or even&lt;br&gt;

    negative. Mean standard deviation matching results in a comparably high root-mean-square
    error (on&lt;br&gt;

    average 11%) for predictions of VWC. Further investigations and measurement networks
    are needed to&lt;br&gt;

    clarify factors causing temporal variation of C band backscatter in tundra regions.&lt;/p&gt;'
