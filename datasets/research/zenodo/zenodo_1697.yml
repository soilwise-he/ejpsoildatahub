  title: "\uFEFFEvidence of plant-soil feedback in South Texas grasslands associated\
    \ with invasive Guinea grass"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Plant-soil feedback (PSF) processes play an integral role in
    structuring plant communities. In native grasslands, PSF has a largely negative
    or stabilizing effect on plant growth contributing to species coexistence and
    succession, but perturbations to a system can alter PSF, leading to long-term
    changes. Through changes to soil abiotic and biotic properties, invasion by non-native
    plants has a strong impact on belowground processes with broad shifts in historical
    PSFs. Guinea grass, Megathyrsus maximus, an emerging invasive in South Texas,
    can efficiently exclude native plants in part due to its fast growth rate and
    high biomass accumulation, but its impacts on belowground processes are unknown.
    Here, we provide a first look at PSF processes in South Texas savannas currently
    undergoing invasion by Guinea grass. In this pilot study, we addressed the question
    of how the presence of the invasive M. maximus may alter PSF compared to uninvaded
    grasslands. Under greenhouse conditions, we assessed germination and growth of
    Guinea grass and the seed bank in soil collected from grasslands invaded and uninvaded
    by Guinea grass. We found that Guinea grass grown in soil from invaded grasslands
    grew taller and accumulated higher biomass than in soil from uninvaded grasslands.
    Plants grown from the seed bank were more species rich and abundant in soil from
    uninvaded grasslands but had higher biomass in soil from invaded grasslands. In
    South Texas savannas, we found evidence to support shifts in the direction of
    PSF processes in the presence of Guinea grass with positive feedback processes
    appearing to reinforce invasion and negative feedback processes possibly contributing
    to species coexistence in uninvaded grasslands. Future work is needed to determine
    the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in PSF and further explore the role
    PSF has in Guinea grass invasion.&lt;/p&gt;'
