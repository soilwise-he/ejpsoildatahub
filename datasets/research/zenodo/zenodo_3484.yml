  title: Enrichment Of Cr, Mn, Ni And Zn In Surface Soil
  abstract: "The textile industry produces highly coloured\neffluents containing polar\
    \ and non-polar compounds. The textile mill\nrun by the Assam Polyester Co-operative\
    \ Society Limited (APOL) is\nsituated at Rangia, about 55 km from Guwahati (26011'\
    \ N, 91047' E)\nin the northern bank of the river Brahmaputra, Assam (India).\
    \ This\nunit was commissioned in June 1988 and started commercial\nproduction\
    \ in November 1988. The installed capacity of the weaving\nunit was 8000 m/day\
    \ and that of the processing unit was 20,000\nm/day. The mill has its own dyeing\
    \ unit with a capacity of 1500-2000\nkg/day. The western side of the mill consists\
    \ of vast agricultural land\nand the far northern and southern side of the mill\
    \ has scattered human\npopulation. The eastern side of the mill has a major road\
    \ for\nthoroughfare. The mill releases its effluents into the agricultural land\n\
    in the western side of the mill. The present study was undertaken to\nassess the\
    \ impact of the textile mill on surface soil quality in and\naround the mill with\
    \ particular reference to Cr, Mn, Ni and Zn.\nSurface soil samples, collected\
    \ along different directions at 200, 500\nand 1000 m were digested and the metals\
    \ were estimated with\nAtomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The metals were found\
    \ in the\nrange of: Cr 50.9 \u2013 105.0 mg kg-1, Mn 19.2- 78.6 mg kg-1, Ni 41.9\
    \ \u2013\n50.6 mg kg-1 and Zn 187.8 \u2013 1095.8 mg kg-1. The study reveals\n\
    enrichment of Cr, Mn, Ni and Zn in the soil near the textile mill."
