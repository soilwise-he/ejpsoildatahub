  title: Spatial Variability Of Some Soil Properties In Mountain Rangelands Of Northern
    Iran
  abstract: "In this paper spatial variability of some chemical and\nphysical soil\
    \ properties were investigated in mountain rangelands of\nNesho, Mazandaran province,\
    \ Iran. 110 soil samples from 0-30 cm\ndepth were taken with systematic method\
    \ on grid 30\xD730 m2 in\nregions with different vegetation cover and transported\
    \ to laboratory.\nThen soil chemical and physical parameters including Acidity\
    \ (pH),\nElectrical conductivity, Caco3, Bulk density, Particle density, total\n\
    phosphorus, total Nitrogen, available potassium, Organic matter,\nSaturation moisture,\
    \ Soil texture (percentage of sand, silt and clay),\nSodium, Calcium, magnesium\
    \ were measured in laboratory. Data\nnormalization was performed then was done\
    \ statistical analysis for\ndescription of soil properties and geostatistical\
    \ analysis for indication\nspatial correlation between these properties and were\
    \ perpetrated\nmaps of spatial distribution of soil properties using Kriging method.\n\
    Results indicated that in the study area Saturation moisture and\npercentage of\
    \ Sand had highest and lowest spatial correlation\nrespectively."
