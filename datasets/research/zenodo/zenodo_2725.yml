  title: Effects of organic and chemical fertilizer on growth and vitamin content
    of Aloe vera L. plant in sandy soil
  abstract: "This research aims at analyzing the response of <strong><em>Aloe vera\
    \ </em>L.</strong> plant on cow manure and urea fertilizer in <em><strong>sandy\
    \ soil</strong></em>. The research which was conducted in Yogyakarta has three\
    \ treatments of 10, 20, and 30t ha<sup>-1</sup> levels of cow manure and five\
    \ levels of urea fertilizer at 0, 150, 300, 450, 600kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. The research\
    \ arranged a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replication. The variables\
    \ measured include yield, growth, and vitamin content. A huge effect was found\
    \ (P &lt; 0.05) between manure and urea. Statistic analysis significant of data\
    \ was tested by analysis of variant and continued Duncan\u2019s Multiple Range\
    \ Test of \u03B1 &lt; 5%. The highest yield and growth rate was located at 30t\
    \ ha<sup>-1</sup> and 450kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, while the most significant content\
    \ of pro-vitamin A, vitamin C and provitamin E were found in 30t ha<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ and 300kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, it can be concluded that 30t ha<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ manure and 300 to 450kg ha<sup>-1</sup> urea are best used to grow plants."
