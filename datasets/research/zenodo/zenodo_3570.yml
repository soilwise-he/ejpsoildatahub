  title: Using GIS and Map Data for the Analysis of the Relationship between Soil
    and Groundwater Quality at Saline Soil Area of Kham Sakaesaeng District, Nakhon
    Ratchasima, Thailand
  abstract: The study area is Kham Sakaesaeng District in Nakhon Ratchasima Province,
    the south section of Northeastern Thailand, located in the Lower Khorat-Ubol Basin.
    This region is the one of saline soil area, located in a dry plateau and regularly
    experience standing with periods of floods and alternating with periods of drought.
    Especially, the drought in the summer season causes the major saline soil and
    saline water problems of this region. The general cause of dry land salting resulted
    from salting on irrigated land, and an excess of water leading to the rising water
    table in the aquifer. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship
    of physical and chemical properties between the soil and groundwater. The soil
    and groundwater samples were collected in both rainy and summer seasons. The content
    of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride and
    salinity were investigated. The experimental result of soil and groundwater samples
    show the slightly pH less than 7, EC (186 to 8,156 us/cm and 960 to 10,712 us/cm),
    TDS (93 to 3,940 ppm and 480 to 5,356 ppm), chloride content (45.58 to 4,177,015
    mg/l and 227.90 to 9,216,736 mg/l), and salinity (0.07 to 4.82 ppt and 0.24 to
    14.46 ppt) in the rainy and summer seasons, respectively. The distribution of
    chloride content and salinity content were interpolated and displayed as a map
    by using ArcMap 10.3 program, according to the season. The result of saline soil
    and brined groundwater in the study area were related to the low-lying topography,
    drought area, and salt-source exposure. Especially, the Rock Salt Member of Maha
    Sarakham Formation was exposed or lies near the ground surface in this study area.
    During the rainy season, salt was eroded or weathered from the salt-source rock
    formation and transported by surface flow or leached into the groundwater. In
    the dry season, the ground surface is dry enough resulting salt precipitates from
    the brined surface water or rises from the brined groundwater influencing the
    increasing content of chloride and salinity in the ground surface and groundwater.
