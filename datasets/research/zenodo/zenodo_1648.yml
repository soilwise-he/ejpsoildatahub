  title: Development of Soil Substitutes for the Sustainable Land Reclamation of Coal
    Mine-Affected Areas
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this paper was to outline a novel approach for the
    use of industrial by-products generated in coal mines and coal-fired power plants
    as the components for artificial soils. Several coal combustion by-products, coal
    mine waste and organic waste materials were tested at laboratory scale for use
    in the reclamation of areas degraded by coal mining activity. The role of artificial
    soils was the land rehabilitation of the high acidic waste heap. The results revealed
    that the amounts of organic matter (14.87&ndash;25.01%) and nutrients in the soil
    substitutes were sufficient to support plant growth, i.e., N (0.37&ndash;0.51%),
    P (0.23&ndash;0.47%), K (1.78&ndash;3.17%), Ca (4.93&ndash;8.39%) and Mg (1.16&ndash;1.71%).
    A phytotoxicity test using white mustard (Sinapis alba) seeds under laboratory
    conditions showed good germination results (56&ndash;66%) for three soil substitutes
    that did not contain fly ash from biomass combustion, compared to the reference
    soil (84%). The relationships established for the aqueous leachate parameters
    of soil substitutes vs. the Sinapis alba germination revealed negative correlations
    with electrical conductivity (r = &minus;0.88), SO4 2&minus; (r = &minus;0.91)
    and Cl&minus; (r = &minus;0.70) ions; the two latter ones were responsible for
    the salinity which hampered the germination process of the soil substitutes. Moreover,
    quite similar correlations were obtained between the germination of Sinapis alba
    and the trace elements of the soil substitutes: Fe (r = &minus;0.69), Cd (r =
    &minus;0.72), Cu (r = &minus;0.80), Pb (r = &minus;0.78) and Zn (r = &minus;0.74).
    However, negative and significant correlations in aqueous leachates were shown
    only with Ni concentration (r = &minus;0.73). The relevance of these results for
    the effect of salinity on germination and the early growth of S. alba was discussed
    in detail and was confirmed with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study
    proved that the physicochemical characteristic of recycled wastes exhibited their
    potential usefulness for the reclamation of affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;'
