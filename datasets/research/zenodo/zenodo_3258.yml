  title: "\uFEFFSoil-borne Ophiostomatales species (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota) in\
    \ beech, oak, pine, and spruce stands in Poland with descriptions of Sporothrix\
    \ roztoczensis sp. nov., S. silvicola sp. nov., and S. tumida sp. nov."
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;          Ophiostomatales (Ascomycota) contains many species,\
    \ most of which are associated with bark beetles. Some members of this order are\
    \ plant or animal pathogens, while others colonize soil, different plant tissues,\
    \ or even carpophores of some Basidiomycota. However, little is known about soil-inhabiting\
    \ Ophiostomatales fungi. A survey of these fungi associated with soil under beech,\
    \ oak, pine, and spruce stands in Poland yielded 623 isolates, representing 10\
    \ species: Heinzbutinia grandicarpa, Leptographium procerum, L. radiaticola, Ophiostoma\
    \ piliferum, O. quercus, Sporothrix brunneoviolacea, S. dentifunda, S. eucastaneae,\
    \ and two newly described taxa, namely Sporothrix roztoczensis sp. nov. and S.\
    \ silvicola sp. nov. In addition, isolates collected from fallen shoots of Pinus\
    \ sylvestris that were pruned by Tomicus sp. are described as Sporothrix tumida\
    \ sp. nov. The new taxa were morphologically characterized and phylogenetically\
    \ analyzed based on multi-loci sequence data (ITS, \u03B2-tubulin, calmodulin,\
    \ and translation elongation factor 1-\u03B1 genes). The Ophiostomatales species\
    \ were especially abundant in soil under pine and oak stands. Leptographium procerum,\
    \ S. silvicola, and S. roztoczensis were the most frequently isolated species\
    \ from soil under pine stands, while S. brunneoviolacea was the most abundant\
    \ in soil under oak stands. The results highlight that forest soil in Poland has\
    \ a wide diversity of Ophiostomatales taxa, but further studies are required to\
    \ uncover the molecular diversity and phylogenetic relationships of these fungi,\
    \ as well as their roles in soil fungal communities.&lt;/p&gt;"
