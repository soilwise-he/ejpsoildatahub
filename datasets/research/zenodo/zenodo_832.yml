  title: 'A US Perspective on Soil Pollution: Observations, Conclusions, and Recommendations'
  abstract: "Soil is our gateway to civilization. We depend on our soil for vegetation,\
    \ habitats, landscape, food, fiber, animal feed, wildlife, water and air quality,\
    \ employment, cultural engagement, and our civilization\u2019s construction and\
    \ physical construction. However, our once natural soils have largely morphed\
    \ into anthropogenic or man-altered soil due to agriculture or construction processes.\
    \ We are heavily regulated by \u201Ccommand and control\u201D legislation and\
    \ regulation, \u201Cpolluter pays\u201D policies, and somewhat influenced by information,\
    \ education, outreach, public opinion, media, and environmental initiatives and\
    \ litigation. These focus more on runoff and underground waters than on soil,\
    \ and are often spotty, inconsistent, unenforced, and neglected. Besides information\
    \ on commonly used methods, with a focus on MONA, and regulation in the United\
    \ States, I offer observations and recommendations from the perspective of an\
    \ advisor working in the US context."
