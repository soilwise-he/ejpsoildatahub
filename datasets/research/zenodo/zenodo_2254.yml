  title: Fertility Status of Soils Under Silvopastoral System on Two Soil Types in
    Imo State, Southeastern Nigeria
  abstract: Understanding the fertility status of soils under different agricultural
    systems is imperative for sustainable crop production and ecological sustainability.
    This study examined the fertility levels of soils under silvopastoral system of
    two soil types in Southeastern Nigeria. Two towns in two states with two parent
    materials in the region were covered namely Owerri in Imo State with coastal plain
    sand and Uturu in Abia State with false bedded sand stone. Surface soil samples
    collected within 30 cm depth were analyzed using standard methods. Silvopastoral
    system and parent materials guided the sampling points. Data obtained from analyzed
    soil samples were statistically analyzed. Significant variations existed in the
    particle distribution of the soil while highest gravimetric moisture content (249.7
    g/kg), total porosity (67.5%) and lowest soil bulk density (0.85 g/cm3 ) were
    recorded in the silvopastoral lands than in non silvopastoral lands. Silvopastoral
    lands contained higher soil organic matter (36. 88 g/kg), total nitrogen (1.87
    g/kg) and exchangeable bases than non silvopastoral lands. There was higher clay
    content (274 g/kg) in false bedded sandstone than in coastal plain sand silvopastoral
    lands. The highest value of soil organic matter (36.88 g/kg) and total nitrogen
    (8.7 g/kg) were recorded in false bedded sandstone under silvopastoral system.
    There was significant negative correlation between bulk density and base saturation
    (r = -0.946) and positive relationship between total exchangeable acidity and
    soil bulk density (r = 0.865). This work revealed that parent materials under
    silvopastoral systems differ in soil physical, chemical and plant nutrient concentration.
    Therefore it is recommended that silvopastoral system should be adopted under
    coastal plain sand for soil fertility improvement due to its poor soil quality.
