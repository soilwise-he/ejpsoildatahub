  title: Productivity and Seasonality Drive Total Soil Respiration in Semi-Arid Juniper
    Woodlands (Juniperus thurifera L., Southern Spain)
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the relationship between forest productivity (joint\
    \ effect of forest maturity and&lt;br&gt;soil quality) and total soil respiration\
    \ (mol CO2 m\U001000002 s\U001000001) in semi-arid juniper woodlands (young&lt;br&gt;woodlands\
    \ growing in abandoned farmlands with deeper soils, and mature woodlands in lithic&lt;br&gt;soils),\
    \ and investigated the seasonal variation in soil CO2 efflux as a function of\
    \ soil temperature&lt;br&gt;and the soil water content. We measured the soil CO2\
    \ efflux from twelve cylinders in the soil over a&lt;br&gt;three-year period using\
    \ LI-6400 equipment. The results show that, in the more productive site (young&lt;br&gt;woodland),\
    \ soil CO2 efflux was higher due to greater respiration, mainly in the driest\
    \ periods. Soil&lt;br&gt;respiration followed a seasonal trend, being higher in\
    \ spring and decreasing in cold periods. In both&lt;br&gt;juniper woodlands and\
    \ especially in the older forest, the CO2 efflux rates were low (&lt;2.5 for Q10),&lt;br&gt;typical\
    \ of slow-growing species. Soil respiration was controlled by soil temperature\
    \ without drought&lt;br&gt;and in the temperate-warm season, whereas respiration\
    \ showed sensitivity to soil water content&lt;br&gt;in periods when edaphic humidity\
    \ was low (but only in the more productive, young forest, which&lt;br&gt;seemed\
    \ to show better adaptation to drought), and under high soil moisture (soil water\
    \ &gt; 25%) for&lt;br&gt;both woodlands, coinciding with warm temperatures in\
    \ the spring. This period also corresponded to&lt;br&gt;the highest CO2 efflux\
    \ recorded in both woodlands. The accumulation of organic C seems to also be&lt;br&gt;important\
    \ to maintain elevated soil respiration in summer, especially in young woodlands.\
    \ Thus,&lt;br&gt;apart from microclimatic conditions, factors related to productivity\
    \ regulate respiratory activity.&lt;/p&gt;"
