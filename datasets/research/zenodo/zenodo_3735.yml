  title: The Effect Of Biochar, Inoculated Biochar And Compost Biological Component
    Of The Soil
  abstract: 'Biochar can be produced from the waste matter and its

    application has been associated with returning of carbon in large

    amounts into the soil. The impacts of this material on physical and

    chemical properties of soil have been described. The biggest part of

    the research work is dedicated to the hypothesis of this material''s

    toxic effects on the soil life regarding its effect on the soil biological

    component. At present, it has been worked on methods which could

    eliminate these undesirable properties of biochar. One of the

    possibilities is to mix biochar with organic material, such as compost,

    or focusing on the natural processes acceleration in the soil. In the

    experiment has been used as the addition of compost as well as the

    elimination of toxic substances by promoting microbial activity in

    aerated water environment. Biochar was aerated for 7 days in a

    container with a volume of 20 l. This way modified biochar had six

    times higher biomass production and reduce mineral nitrogen

    leaching. Better results have been achieved by mixing biochar with

    compost.'
