  title: Global maps of soil temperature
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Research in global change ecology relies heavily on global climatic
    grids derived from estimates of air temperature in open areas at around 2&nbsp;m
    above the ground. These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation
    canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur
    and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature
    and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;resolution for
    0&ndash;5 and 5&ndash;15&nbsp;cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating
    the difference (i.e. offset) between in situ soil temperature measurements, based
    on time series from over 1200 1-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;pixels (summarized
    from 8519 unique temperature sensors) across all the world&#39;s major terrestrial
    biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric
    reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show
    that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded
    air temperature, by up to 10&deg;C (mean&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.1&deg;C),
    with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in
    cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.3&deg;C)
    than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are
    on average slightly cooler (&minus;0.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.3&deg;C). The observed
    substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of
    climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
    are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially
    in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here
    are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines.
    Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting
    more in situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal
    resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.&lt;/p&gt;'
