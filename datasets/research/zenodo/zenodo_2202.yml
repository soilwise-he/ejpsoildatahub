  title: ASSESSMENT OF FLUCTUATION POTENTIAL OF DYNAMIC WAVES ON A FOOTING FOUNDED
    ON SOIL WITH VARIED SATURATIONS
  abstract: This report presents the review of literature pertaining to characterizing
    the performance of footing resting on soil subjected to dynamic push load, for
    the varied subsurface saturation levels and to quantify the propagation potential
    of the induced dynamic waves in the soil medium across the control volume. A composite
    model is proposed to developed to simulate the Soil-Structure Interaction under
    dynamic loads and to determine the settlement profile of the footing . The degree
    of improvement generated by for several embedment depths of a footing resting
    on soil medium is a subject of investigation in this proposed work, Dynamic loads
    of broad band excitation are selected in this proposed work to study the influence
    of it on the interaction between the soil and the footing (SSI) and to determine
    the performance under static loads and lateral excitations.
