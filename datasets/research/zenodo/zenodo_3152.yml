  title: 'Sources and modes of action of invasive knotweed allelopathy: the effects
    of leaf litter and trained soil on the germination and growth of native plants'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Invasive knotweeds, native to Eastern Asia, are among the most\
    \ dominant plant invaders of European and North American temperate ecosystems.\
    \ Recent studies indicate that one cause of this dominance might be allelopathy,\
    \ but the possible sources and modes of action of this allelopathy are insufficiently\
    \ understood. Here, we asked whether the invasive knotweed Fallopia \xD7 bohemica\
    \ can exert allelopathic effects on native plants also through its leaf litter,\
    \ or through persistent soil contaminants, and whether these affect the germination\
    \ or growth of native plants. In a germination experiment with nine native species\
    \ neither litter leachate, an aqueous extract of knotweed leaves added to the\
    \ soil, nor trained soil with a history of Fallopia pre-cultivation suppressed\
    \ the germination or early growth of natives. A mesocosm study with experimental\
    \ native communities showed that the presence of F. \xD7 bohemica, although not\
    \ a dominant in these communities, caused significant shifts of life-history strategy\
    \ in two dominant natives, and that similar effects could be elicited through\
    \ litter leachates or trained soil alone. However, there were hardly any effects\
    \ on the biomass of natives. Our study indicates that knotweed allelopathy acts\
    \ on the growth rather than germination of natives, and that soil contamination\
    \ through persistent allelochemicals may not be a significant problem in habitat\
    \ restoration. It also shows that allelopathic effects can sometimes be subtle\
    \ changes in life-history and allocation patterns of the affected species.&lt;/p&gt;"
