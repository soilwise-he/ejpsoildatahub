  title: A Comparative Study On Soil And Surface Water Quality Around Kurichi, Ukkadam
    And Singanallur Lake In Coimbatore City
  abstract: Soil and surface water are the essential components for survial of oganism.
    Surface water quality contamination is one of the most important environmental
    issues in Tamil Nadu. Due to increase in the population and industrialization
    of Coimbatore and there is solid waste are generation. The effluent of these wastes
    are being disposed randomly on soils, river, lake and roadside without any treatment.
    It is also affected by industrial waste water, dumping household waste and other
    causes. In this study of Kuruchi, Ukkadam and Singanallur Lakes the physicochemical
    parameters of surface water and soil were tested. The parameters for surface water
    including pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Hardness,
    Calcium, Magnesium, Chlorides, Sulphates, NO2, NO3, Carbonate, Bicarbonate, Sodium,
    Pottasium, Dissolved oxygen COD and BOD to determine the water quality of study
    area. The physico chemical parameters of soil including pH, Electrical Conductivity,
    Organic matter, Calcium, Magnesium, Phospurus, Nitrogen, Pottasium, Copper, Zinc,
    Iron and Manganese. Mostly all the physicochemical parameters were found above
    the prescribed limit as recommended by WHO (2011) and BIS (2010) drinking water
    quality. There may be suggested that conservation of fresh water lakes can be
    implemented and regular monitoring for management of good water quality needful
    for sustainable environment<strong>.</strong>
