  title: Soil bacterial community responds to land-use change in riparian ecosystems
  abstract: '<em>Background and Objectives:</em> Riparian forests were frequently
    cleared and converted to agricultural pastures. In recent times these pastures
    are often revegetated in an effort to return riparian forest structure and function.
    We tested if there is a change in the soil bacterial taxonomy and function in
    areas of riparian forest cleared for agricultural pasture, then revegetated; and
    if soil bacterial taxonomy and function is related to vegetation and soil physicochemical
    properties. <em>Materials and Methods:</em> The study was conducted in six study
    areas in south - eastern Australia, each comprising of three land-use types: remnant
    riparian forest, cleared forest converted to pasture and revegetated pastures.
    We surveyed three strata of vegetation and sampled top-soil and sub-soil to characterize
    physicochemical properties. Taxonomic and functional composition of soil bacterial
    communities were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequences and community level physiological
    profiles respectively. <em>Results:</em> Few soil physiochemical properties differed
    with land-use despite distinct vegetation in pasture relative to remnant and revegetated
    areas. Overall bacterial taxonomic and functional composition of remnant forest
    and revegetated soils were distinct from pasture soil. Land-use differences were
    not consistent for all bacterial phyla, as Acidobacteria were more abundant in
    remnant soils, conversely Actinobacteria were more abundant in pasture soils.
    Overall bacterial metabolic activity, and soil carbon and nitrogen content decreased
    with soil depth, while bacterial metabolic diversity and evenness increased with
    soil depth. Soil bacterial taxonomic composition was related to soil texture and
    soil fertility, while functional composition was only related to soil texture.
    <em>Conclusions:</em> Our results suggest that the conversion of riparian forests
    to pasture is associated with significant changes in the soil bacterial community,
    whereby revegetation contributes to reversing such changes. Nevertheless, the
    observed changes in bacterial community composition (taxonomic and functional)
    were not directly related to changes in vegetation, but were more closely related
    to soil attributes.'
