  title: Available Soil Phosphorus in a Rice-Wheat Rotation After Extended Superphosphate
    Application
  abstract: This article 'Available Soil Phosphorus in a Rice-Wheat Rotation After
    Extended Superphosphate Application' appeared in the International Rice Research
    Newsletter series, created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).
    The primary objective of this publication was to expedite communication among
    scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice and
    for rice based cropping systems. This publication will report what scientists
    are doing to increase the production of rice in as much as this crop feeds the
    most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
