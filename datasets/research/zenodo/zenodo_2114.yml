  title: 'Sewage sludge fertiliser use: Implications for soil and plant copper evolution
    in forest and agronomic soils'
  abstract: Fertilisation with sewage sludge may lead to crop toxicity and environmental
    degradation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two types of soils (forest
    and agronomic), two types of vegetation (unsown (coming from soil seed bank) and
    sown), and two types of fertilisation (sludge fertilisation and mineral fertilisation,
    with a no fertiliser control) in afforested and treeless swards and in sown and
    unsown forestlands on the total and available Cu  oncentration in soil, the leaching
    of this element and the Cu levels in plant. The experimental design was completely
    randomised with nine treatments and three replicates. Fertilisation with sewage
    sludge increased the concentration of Cu in soil and plant, but the soil values
    never exceeded the maximum set by Spanish regulations. Sewage sludge inputs increased
    both the total and Mehlich 3 Cu concentrations in agronomic soils and the Cu levels
    in plant developed in agronomic and forest soils, with this effect pronounced
    in the unsown swards of forest soils. Therefore, the use of high quality sewage
    sludge as fertiliser may improve the global productivity of forest, agronomic
    and silvopastoral systems without creating environmental hazards.
