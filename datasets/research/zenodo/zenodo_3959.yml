  title: Experimental Studies On Treated Sub-Base Soil With Fly Ash And Cement For
    Sustainable Design Recommendations
  abstract: The pavement constructions on soft and expansive soils are not durable
    and unable to sustain heavy traffic loading. As a result, pavement failures and
    settlement problems will occur very often even under light traffic loading due
    to cyclic and rolling effects. Geotechnical engineers have dwelled deeply into
    this matter, and adopt various methods to improve the engineering characteristics
    of soft fine-grained soils and expansive soils. The problematic soils are either
    replaced by good and better quality material or treated by using chemical stabilization
    with various binding materials. Increased the strength and durability are also
    the part of the sustainability drive to reduce the environment footprint of the
    built environment by the efficient use of resources and waste recycle materials.
    This paper presents a series of laboratory tests and evaluates the effect of cement
    and fly ash on the strength and drainage characteristics of soil in Miri. The
    tests were performed at different percentages of cement and fly ash by dry weight
    of soil. Additional tests were also performed on soils treated with the combinations
    of fly ash with cement and lime. The results of this study indicate an increase
    in unconfined compression strength and a decrease in hydraulic conductivity of
    the treated soil.
