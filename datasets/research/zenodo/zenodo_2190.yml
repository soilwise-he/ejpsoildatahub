  title: Soil Dynamics of Pre- and Post- Slash-and-Burn Jhum Fields of Tirap District,
    Arunachal Pradesh
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jhum agriculture is widely practiced on Arunachal
    Pradesh&rsquo;s hill slopes, and it is more than just a means of subsistence;
    it is a way of life that has symbolic connotations for the socio-cultural life
    and natural landscapes, and it is an essential component of survival and economic
    existence. An attempt was made to study the soil characterization associated with
    pre-and post- burned jhum cultivation practiced by the ethnic Nocte and Tutsa
    tribes of Tirap district, Arunachal Pradesh. The soil samples were collected from
    the same location at the pre-and post-burnt fields from the various depth of soil
    profile A (0-20) cm, B (20-40) cm, and C (40-60) cm. The present study reveals
    an overall increase in porosity, temp, pH, Moisture, and bulk density because
    of the burning of the jhum field. In post-burned jhum fields of all the locations,
    there was an overall increase in the percentage of Sodium and Calcium in soil
    collected and a decrease in the percentage of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium.
    The pH was mostly found to be acidic and increasing with the depth of the soil
    profile. There was a significant difference in total nitrogen content of the soils,
    whereas phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and sodium showed little differences for
    pre-and post-burned jhum fields. The effects of the slashing and burning process
    promote changes in soil physical as well as chemical properties, thereby influencing
    the nutrient status. Deterioration of soil nutrients starts after the burning
    of vegetation and continues subsequently throughout the various stages of jhum
    cultivation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
