  title: Working body for pre-sowing application of liquid mineral fertilizers in
    the soil
  abstract: To obtain high yields of crops it is necessary to create the most favorable
    conditions for growth and development of plants and in particular their root system,
    it is necessary to create optimal parameters of the subsoil layer of soil, where
    the root system of plants develops, normal growth and aboveground mass. Deep and
    strong root system reduces the dependence of plant development on weather conditions,
    which is very important in areas of risky agriculture. Soil compaction has a detrimental
    effect on plants, limits their productivity, reduces pores between soil particles
    containing air and water, and causes its compaction external pressure by tractors
    and cultivators destroys pores, roots can not properly grow in such soil, and
    plants do not get the right amount of nutrients needed for their maximum growth.
    Numerical studies have shown that excessive looseness and density under the seed
    layer, as a rule, limits the penetration of plants into the soil. Their surface
    development is highly undesirable because it leads to a deterioration in the supply
    of plants with moisture and nutrients and adversely affects plant productivity.
    When liquid fertilizers (ammonia water, CAS) are applied to the dense layers of
    the soil at the rate of 0-40 kg of active substance on nitrogen, the growth of
    the root system deep into the soil is significantly enhanced. Existing working
    bodies for the application of liquid mineral fertilizers to the soil cannot perform
    this task at the appropriate level. Under the influence of known flat wedges there
    is a deformation of the soil, which always exceeds the allowable limits for the
    subseed layer. The working body with only the minimum cutting angles and blade
    width can satisfy the proposed requirements for deep application of liquid fertilizers
    without a significant reduction in the density of soil composition before sowing.
