  title: Experimental Determination Of Variability In Permeability Of Sandy Silt Soil
    Mixed With Fly Ash In Proportionate
  abstract: This paper presents the experimental determination of variability in permeability
    of sandy silt soil by blending with fly ash. The grain size, porosity, structure
    of the soil, specific gravity of the soil, viscosity and temperature are important
    factors in varying the permeability of the soil. Permeability is the flow conduction
    property of the soil. The void ratio with in the soil plays a vital role in varying
    the permeability. By blending with finer grains like fly ash in the soil with
    sandy silt the permeability will vary. This phenomenon can be observed through
    experimentation in the laboratory. The variation in the drainage property of the
    soil also observed. This paper includes all the variation in the flow property
    of the soil (sandy silt soil) by adequate mixing of the fly ash. Fly ash is a
    major solid by-product of the combustion of pulverized coal in thermal power plants.
    Five soil samples with different mixes of sandy silt and fly ash were obtained
    for comparison. Rigorous laboratory tests were performed to determine the individual
    properties. Tests such as Specific Gravity Test, Atterberg Limit Test (Liquid
    Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index), Relative Density Test, Particle Size
    Analysis, and Permeability Test were performed. From the results of these tests,
    it is observed that increase in fly ash content in soil Maximum Dry Density (MDD)
    decreased and Optimum Water Content (OMC) increased. Permeability is decrease
    with increase in fly ash in sandy silt soil.  The decrease in permeability of
    sandy silt soil helps in stabilizing this soil and consequently increases the
    shear parameters of the sandy silt soil.
