  title: DEPENDENCE OF PHYTOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF AGROCENOSES ON AGROPHYSICAL INDICATORS
    OF SOIL
  abstract: "An express-evaluation of the level of development of field agrocenoses\
    \ phytomass and agrophysical soil indicators is necessary for rapid technological\
    \ optimization of the growing conditions of crops in order to more fully realize\
    \ their productive potential, as well as to preserve and reproduce soil fertility.\
    \ The research was carried out in 2020\u20132022 at the experimental field of\
    \ the Orenburg State Agrarian University. The objects of research were the normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) of agrocenoses of winter wheat (Triticum\
    \ aestivum L.), spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivated\
    \ under minimum tillage technology and soil agrophysical parameters (hardness,\
    \ humidity, density) at the experimental site. NDVI was determined using remote\
    \ sensing data and a hand-held sensor Green Seek\u0435r Handheld Crop Sensor,\
    \ Model HCS\u2013100. The penetrologger Eijkelkamp 06.15.SA was used to determine\
    \ the hardness of the soil; the density of the arable soil layer was determined\
    \ by N.A. Kachinsky drilling method; soil moisture was determined by the thermostatic-weight\
    \ method. Digital material was processed using generally accepted methods of statistical\
    \ analysis. We have established the acceptability of modern instrumental methods\
    \ (using portable devices) for determining phytometric parameters of crops and\
    \ agrophysical properties of soils; the undoubted advantages of these devices\
    \ are their ease of use and speed of obtaining results. The high convergence between\
    \ the results of NDVI determination using satellite images and those obtained\
    \ by ground scanning was confirmed. The dependence of phytometric parameters of\
    \ oat agrocenosis (according to NDVI) on agrophysical indicators of the soil was\
    \ revealed. The most pronounced inverse relationship (r = \u20130.52) was observed\
    \ between NDVI and the density of the upper soil horizon (5\u201310 cm), as well\
    \ as between NDVI and the hardness of the soil layers: 5-10 cm (r = \u20130.43)\
    \ and 25\u201330 cm (r = \u20130.52). With a certain degree of conditionality,\
    \ this connection can be explained by the transition to direct sowing in modern\
    \ agricultural technologies and the legacy of deep tillage in retrospect, which\
    \ created a compacted soil layer in these horizons."
