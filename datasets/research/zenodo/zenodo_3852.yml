  title: STUDIES ON MICROBIAL PRODUCTION OF INDOLE ACETIC ACID FROM SOIL MICRO FLORA
    OF RAIGAD DISTRICT
  abstract: Indole acetic acid (IAA) production is a major property of rhizosphere
    bacteria that stimulate and facilitate plant growth. The present work deals with
    isolation, characterization and identification of Indole acetic acid producing
    bacteria from the rhizospheric soil from Raigad district. Out of ten isolates
    four isolate were selected as efficient Indole acetic acid producers. Optimization
    of Indole acetic acid production was carried out at different cultural conditions
    of pH and temperature with varying media components such as carbon and nitrogen
    source, tryptophan concentration. Partial purification of IAA was done and purity
    was confirmed with thin layer chromatography. Subsequently, effect on plant growth
    was tested by measuring root and shoot length. In conclusion the study suggests
    the IAA producing bacteria can be used to promote plant growth.
