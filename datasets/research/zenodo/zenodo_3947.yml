  title: Yield, Yield Components, Soil Minerals And Aroma Of Kdml 105 Rice In Tungkularonghai,
    Roi-Et,Thailand
  abstract: 'Pearson-s correlation coefficient and sequential path

    analysis has been used for determining the interrelationship among

    yield, yield components, soil minerals and aroma of Khao Dawk Mali

    (KDML) 105 rice grown in the area of Tungkularonghai in Roi-Et

    province, located in the northeast of Thailand. Pearson-s correlation

    coefficient in this study showed that the number of panicles was the

    only factor that had positive significant (0.790**) effect on grain

    yield. Sequential path analysis revealed that the number of panicles

    followed by the number of fertile spikelets and 100-grain weight

    were the first-order factors which had positive direct effects on grain

    yield. Whereas, other factors analyzed had indirect effects

    influencing grain yield. This study also indicated that no significant

    relationship was found between the aroma level and any of the

    factors analyzed.'
