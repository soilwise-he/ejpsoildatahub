  title: Influence Of Agricultural Lime On Soil Properties And Wheat (Triticum Aestivum
    L.) Yield On Acidic Soils Of Uasin Gishu County, Kenya
  abstract: "A study was carried out to investigate the influence of agricultural\
    \ lime (21% CaO) from Koru, Kisumu on soil properties and wheat yield on acidic\
    \ soils of Uasin Gishu county. Field trials were conducted at Chepkoilel University\
    \ College farm and in Kipsangui area of Uasin Gishu county. Soils were analyzed\
    \ to determine their pH, available P and other nutrient levels before treatment\
    \ application. The experiment was a split plot arrangement with two wheat varieties\
    \ as the main plots and the lime treatments as the subplots. The two varieties\
    \ compared were \u2018Njoro BW 2\u2019 and \u2018KS Mwamba\u2019 characterized\
    \ as tolerant and moderate tolerant to soil acidity, respectively. Phosphorus\
    \ and nitrogen were applied as a blanket treatment at the rates of 40 kg P205\
    \ /ha and 46 kg N/ha respectively. Lime was applied at the rates of 0.0, 0.5,\
    \ 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 t/ha. Soils from the two sites were acidic with low to moderate\
    \ available P for Chepkoilel and Kipsangui sites respectively. Soil pH and soil\
    \ available P increased with the increase in the rate of lime addition. Wheat\
    \ grain yield increased significantly (p=0.05) due to soil acidity amendment above\
    \ the control. There was a high positive correlation between wheat yields and\
    \ soil available P at both sites at harvest. High cost of inorganic inputs, low\
    \ wheat grain prices and the effects of the erratic rains made the majority of\
    \ the treatments economically unviable for adaptation by farmers. However, the\
    \ most profitable treatment was 2 t/ha of lime in Njoro BW 2 at Kipsangui site.\
    \ There was no viable treatment at Chepkoilel site. Higher wheat yields may probably\
    \ be achieved from rates of lime above 2 t/ha."
