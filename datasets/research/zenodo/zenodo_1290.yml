  title: MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTIC OF FERRO LATERITE SOIL WITH CEMENT STABILIZATION
    AS BASE MATERIAL
  abstract: 'This study aimed to determine and evaluated the mechanical characteristic
    of the potential ferro laterite soil with cement stabilization to be used as base
    material. Ferro laterite soil obtained from three different sites at the East
    Halmahera Regency. The sampling was process by conventional excavation on the
    surface, soil sampling was inserted into the sample bag and labeling as LH1 for
    first location, LH2 for the second location, and LH3 for a third location. Furthermore,
    soil is prepared for physical properties test. The sampling results were tested
    for physical properties of the soil according to ASTM and SNI standardization,
    the testing includes: moisture content, particle size distribution, specific gravity,
    and the Atterberg limits, as well as compaction test. Making of the soil test
    specimen is done by mixing the ferro laterite soil with the addition of cement
    in a composition of 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% on the initial condition of maximum density
    and optimum moisture content gained from standard Proctor test. Cylindrical test
    specimen with dimensions H = 2D, then cured for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before being
    tested for soil compressive strength with UCS testing. The test results showed
    that the ferro laterite soil stabilization with cement increases the compressive
    strength for the three types of ferro laterite soil that is significantly until
    the curing time of 28 days (73-357 kPa, 79-588 kPa, 62-450 kPa, respectively for
    LH1, LH2 and LH3). Based on these test results, the ferro laterite soil has the
    potential to be used as road base material and construction material, but it is
    necessary to test in detail the physical model (prototype) prior to implementation
    in the field.'
