  title: Monitoring and Evaluation of Microbial Load and Physicochemical Characterization
    of Soil from Selected Dumpsites in Port-Harcourt
  abstract: 'The high incidence of heavy metals in the environment originating from
    innumerable anthropogenic activities has recently gained attention. The indiscriminate
    and untreated waste disposal system in a landfill seems like a major pathway in
    which these metals are found predominantly in the biosphere. This study examined
    the soil''s physical, chemical, and biological characteristics from solid waste
    dumpsites in Port Harcourt. This research was conducted at dumpsites located on
    Latitude 4.9046<sup>o</sup>N, Longitude 6.9630<sup>o</sup>E and 4.9046<sup>o</sup>N
    and Longitude 6.9630<sup>o</sup>E for dormant and active dumpsites respectively,
    while the control site was sampled 200m away from the various dumpsites on Latitude:
    4.9044<sup>o</sup>N and Longitude: 6.9628<sup>o</sup>E. The systematic sampling
    technique was adopted. The soil sample was collected at a depth of 0-15m using
    a soil auger and analysis was done using standard methods. The highest increment
    in mean soil Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and P was found in control site
    soils. Mean soil K, N and S was high in the active site soils and the concentration
    of N was low in the dormant site soils while pH and conductivity were highest
    in the active dumpsite soils. Concentration of 28.9kg/mg and 9.89 mg/kg of Pb
    and Cd respectively were reported at active dumpsite soils while 18mg/kg of Pb
    and 2.8 mg/kg of Cd were found at the dormant (inactive) dumpsite soils. Soil
    physical properties showed a remarkable variation among the sampled areas. The
    highest bulk and particle density was reported at active dumpsite soils while
    soil texture was loamy sandy soil for both dumpsites. Microbial growth and diversity
    were predisposed; THBC, TFC, HUBC and HUFC were reported highest in dormant (inactive)
    soil. Therefore indiscriminate waste disposal system modifies soil physicochemical
    properties and microbial activity. In conclusion, monitoring and evaluation system
    should be put in place to ensure proper segregation of waste from collection points,
    this will help decrease the amount of metal-prone materials from reaching the
    dumpsite while liquid waste should be properly treated before being discharged
    to avoid polluting ground and surface water through leaching and erosion.'
