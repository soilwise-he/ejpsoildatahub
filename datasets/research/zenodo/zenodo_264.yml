  title: Soil Carbon Status of SRUC Platforms
  abstract: The work package of M8/M9 includes assessing the soil carbon storage and
    stability of samples collected from agricultural research platforms across Scotland.
    In conjunction with C2, the unique network of experimental platform research sites
    within SRUC were sampled and these will be used to baseline the soil carbon status
    of these soils. The same fields in these platforms will be sampled in five years
    to estimate the effect of management on carbon soil carbon status.
