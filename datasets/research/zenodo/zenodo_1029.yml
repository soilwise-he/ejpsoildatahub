  title: Sand content (sandtotal) soil maps of the Upper Colorado River Basin
  abstract: 'The data here were originally posted to facilitate timely and transparent
    peer review. The final public data release with formal metadata is now available
    from at the following location: Nauman, T.W., and Duniway, M.C., 2020, Predictive
    soil property maps with prediction uncertainty at 30 meter resolution for the
    Colorado River Basin above Lake Mead: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9SK0DO2.
    Associated publication: Nauman, T. W., and Duniway, M. C., 2020, A hybrid approach
    for predictive soil property mapping using conventional soil survey data: Soil
    Science Society of America Journal, v. 84, no. 4, p. 1170-1194. https://doi.org/10.1002/saj2.20080.
    Repository includes maps of sand content (sandtotal) as defined by United States
    soil survey program. Sand content is estimated by percent weight of the &lt;2mm
    portion of the soil. These data are preliminary or provisional and are subject
    to revision. They are being provided to meet the need for timely best science.
    The data have not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
    and are provided on the condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S. Government
    shall be held liable for any damages resulting from the authorized or unauthorized
    use of the data. This data should be used in combination with a soil depth or
    depth to restriction layer map (both layers that will be released soon as part
    of this project) to eliminate areas mapped at deeper depths than the soil actually
    goes. This is a limitation of this data which will hopefully be updated in future
    updates. The creation and interpretation of this data is documented in the following
    article. Please note this article has not been reviewed yet and this citation
    will be updated as the peer review process proceeds. Nauman, T. W., Duniway, M.

    File Name Details: ACCURACY!! Please see manuscript and Github repository (https://github.com/naumi421/SoilReconProps)
    for full details on accuracy. We do provide cross validation (CV) accuracy plots
    in this repository for both the overall sample (NRCS field pedons plus NRCS laboratory
    pedons; file ending _CV_plots.tif) and for just the CV results at laboratory pedons
    (file ending _CV_SCD_plots.tif). These plots compare CV predictions with observed
    values relative to a 1:1 line. Values plotted near the 1:1 line are more accurate.
    Note that values are plotted in hex-bin density scatter plots because of the large
    number of observations (most are &gt;3000). Elements are separated by underscore
    (_) in the following sequence: property_r_depth_cm_geometry_model_additional_elements.extension
    Example: sandtotal_r_0_cm_2D_QRF.tif Indicates sand content (sandtotal) at 0 cm
    depth using a 2D model (separate model for each depth) employing a quantile regression
    forest. This file is the raster prediction map for this model. There may be additional
    GIS files associated with this file (e.g. pyramids) that have the same file name,
    but different extensions. The following elements may also exist on the end of
    filenames indicating other spatial files that characterize a given model''s uncertainty
    (see below). _95PI_h: Indicates the layer is the upper 95% prediction interval
    value. _95PI_l: Indicates the layer is the lower 95% prediction interval value.
    _95PI_relwidth: Indicates the layer is the 95% relative prediction interval (RPI).
    The RPI is a standardization of the prediction interval that indicates that model
    is constraining uncertainty relative to the original sample. RPI values less than
    one represent uncertainty is being improved by the model relative to the original
    sample, and values less than 0.5 indicate low uncertainty in predictions. See
    paper listed above and also Nauman and Duniway (In revision) for more details
    on RPI. References Nauman, T. W., and Duniway, M. C., In Revision, Relative prediction
