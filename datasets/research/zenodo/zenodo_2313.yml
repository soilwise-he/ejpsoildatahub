  title: A Review on Variety and Variability of Soil-less media for Maximizing Yield
    of Greenhouse Horticultural Crops
  abstract: "<em>Soil based agriculture have now a dare challenge for us in these\
    \ upcoming days due to lack of land availability, massive acceleration in the\
    \ field of industrialization and urbanization.The present review deals with the\
    \ alternative soil-less media for Growing plants. Soil-less media is mainly demands\
    \ the best nutritional supplement for healthier growth and development. Soil-less\
    \ culture is an artificial means of providing plants artificial substrates for\
    \ efficient and effective use of water, fertilizers, less chemicals for eradication\
    \ of pest and disease control. Substrates used in soil less culture must be lost\
    \ cost, disease free, easily available and should be able to provide sufficient\
    \ nutrients to crop plants grown in it. Substrate composition should be chosen\
    \ depending on the kind of plant, growth stage, target quality of the product,\
    \ etc. if there is slightly variation in nutritional management there will be\
    \ great impact on plant life span. Substrates are grouped into three categories\
    \ of materials 1) inorganic \u2013 Sand, gravel, pebbles, perlite, rock wool,\
    \ vermiculite, tuff, pumice. 2) Organic \u2013 rice hulls, peat, saw dust, straw,\
    \ coconut coir, paper, cardboard materials. 3) Synthetic -foam ship, sponges,\
    \ moisture absorbent plastic fiber. The soil-less media can be (i) Liquid hydroponics,\
    \ (ii) Solid media culture and (iii) Aeroponics. Growing media also maintain the\
    \ ionic balance and water content for developing plant roots.</em>"
