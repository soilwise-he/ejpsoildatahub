  title: A Study on the Effect of Permeation Grouting With Cement and Lime in Sandy
    Soil
  abstract: Permeation grouting is an effective way to improve the engineering properties
    of the sandy soil. In this technique the grout is injected into the ground without
    disturbing the soil structure. In this investigation an attempt is made to study
    the comparison of permeation grouting with cement and lime grout. The cement grout
    and lime grout are injected into the soil specimen by changing weight of cement
    and lime which will be at 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, &amp; 10% by the soil weight. Grouting
    is conducted in a tank of size 30 x 30 x 30cm. The grouted samples are tested
    in triaxial test after 1, 7, &amp; 14 days of curing period. The permeability
    test also conducted on the grouted samples. The test results revealed that the
    shear strength properties are improved for grouted soil, where as the permeability
    is reduced.
