  title: "Plant\u2013soil feedbacks: a meta\u2010analytical review"
  abstract: Recent studies suggest that plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may provide mechanisms
    for plant diversity, succession, and invasion.  To determine whether there is
    general support for these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of PSF experiments,
    determining effect sizes among plant types, ecosystems, and experimental approaches.  Overall,
    PSFs had a medium negative effect size, indicating that most plants create soils
    that decrease growth of conspecifics.  PSFs were very large and negative for annual
    and early-successional species, supporting the hypothesis that PSFs maintain diversity
    by accelerating species replacement (e.g., succession).  Across all studies, non-native
    plants did not benefit from PSFs; however, in studies that measured non-native
    and native PSFs in the same study system, non-natives did benefit from PSFs.  In
    a comparison of life-forms, grasses demonstrated more negative PSFs than forbs,
    shrubs, and trees.  A review of PSF methodologies showed that experiments using
    sterilized/inoculated soils, greenhouse conditions, and manipulative experiments
    to cultivate soils exaggerated PSFs compared to experiments that used whole field
    soils, field conditions, and natural experiments to cultivate soils, respectively.  Our
    findings provide broad support for the role of PSFs in plant community assembly,
    but also underscore the need for expanded testing under field conditions.
