  title: Isolation and Identification of Soil-Derived Pseudomonas Species with Potential
    Plant Growth Promoting Traits
  abstract: Microbial biofertilizers have proven to be a<br> better substitute to
    the chemical fertilizers. Pseudomonas<br> is a beneficial bacterium in enhancing
    growth of the<br> plants. In this study, attempt was made to collect soil<br>
    sample and isolate the pseudomonas strains, study their<br> morphological, cultural
    characteristics. These isolates<br> were subjected to various biochemical tests
    such as Indole<br> Acetic Acid (IAA) Test, Triple-Sugar-Iron Test, etc., and<br>
    out of nine isolates namely PF1,PF2,PF9 , PF2, PF7 and<br> PF8 have yield maximum
    results and have shown a<br> potential for their use as biofertilizers.
