  title: CNN-Based Soil-Seed Recommender
  abstract: "Abstract\u2014 India is the land of agriculture and is among the top\
    \ three global producers of many seeds. The Indian farmer lies at the heart of\
    \ the agricultural sector yet most Indian farmers remain at the bottom of the\
    \ social strata. In addition, farmers find it difficult to decide which seed is\
    \ best suitable and profitable for their soil, in spite of the few technological\
    \ solutions that exist today, due to the variation in soil types across geographical\
    \ regions. This paper proposes a seed recommendation system that uses a Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network (CNN), MobileNetV2 Architecture to predict the optimal seed to\
    \ be grown by analyzing various parameters.\n\_"
