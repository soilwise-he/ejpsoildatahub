  title: Evaluation Of The Mechanical Behavior Of A Retaining Wall Structure On A
    Weathered Soil Through Probabilistic Methods
  abstract: "Retaining slope structures are increasingly considered in geotechnical\
    \ engineering projects due to extensive urban cities growth. These kinds of engineering\
    \ constructions may present instabilities over the time and may require reinforcement\
    \ or even rebuilding of the structure. In this context, statistical analysis is\
    \ an important tool for decision making regarding retaining structures. This study\
    \ approaches the failure probability of the construction of a retaining wall over\
    \ the debris of an old and collapsed one. The new solution\u2019s extension length\
    \ will be of approximately 350 m and will be located over the margins of the Lake\
    \ Parano\xE1, Brasilia, in the capital of Brazil. The building process must also\
    \ account for the utilization of the ruins as a caisson. A series of <em>in situ</em>\
    \ and laboratory experiments defined local soil strength parameters. A Standard\
    \ Penetration Test (SPT) defined the <em>in situ</em> soil stratigraphy. Also,\
    \ the parameters obtained were verified using soil data from a collection of masters\
    \ and doctoral works from the University of Bras\xEDlia, which is similar to the\
    \ local soil. Initial studies show that the concrete wall is the proper solution\
    \ for this case, taking into account the technical, economic and deterministic\
    \ analysis. On the other hand, in order to better analyze the statistical significance\
    \ of the factor-of-safety factors obtained, a Monte Carlo analysis was performed\
    \ for the concrete wall and two more initial solutions. A comparison between the\
    \ statistical and risk results generated for the different solutions indicated\
    \ that a Gabion solution would better fit the financial and technical feasibility\
    \ of the project."
