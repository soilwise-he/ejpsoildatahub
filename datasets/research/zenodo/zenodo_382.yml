  title: Rainfall Induced Saline Soil Management through Leaching
  abstract: "<em>This study was conducted in the experimental farm of Bangladesh Agricultural\
    \ University (BAU) to evaluate rainfall-induced leaching of salt in the field\
    \ soil over time. There were five treatments </em><em>-</em><em> I<sub>1</sub>:\
    \ soil irrigated with fresh water, I<sub>2</sub>: soil irrigated with saline water\
    \ of electrical conductivity (EC) = 4 dS/m, I<sub>3</sub>: soil irrigated with\
    \ saline water of EC = 7 dS/m, I<sub>4</sub>: soil irrigated with saline water\
    \ of EC = 10 dS/m, and I<sub>5</sub>: soil irrigated with saline water of EC =\
    \ 13 dS/m. The treatments were replicated thrice. Soil samples were collected\
    \ from each plot at 0</em><em>-</em><em>20, 20</em><em>-</em><em>40, 40</em><em>-</em><em>60\
    \ cm soil profiles at, usually, 15 days interval. By determining the electrical\
    \ conductivity of the samples salt leaching pattern in the treatments at different\
    \ depths was evaluated. Variation of soul pH was also evaluated. At the end of\
    \ the rainy season, the salt accumulated due to irrigation completely leached\
    \ out of the top 0</em><em>-</em><em>20 cm soil profile in all treatments. The\
    \ salt from the upper soil profile (0</em><em>-</em><em>20 cm) leached down and\
    \ increased the salinity of the lower soil profiles. At the end of the rainy season,\
    \ the salinity in the lower soil profile did not reduce to its initial value,\
    \ implying that the rainfall was not enough to wash out the imposed salinity from\
    \ the entire root zone soil. At the early period of rainy season, the rainfall\
    \ was relatively little, but the rate of EC reduction was high, especially in\
    \ the soil with high salinity (treatments I<sub>4</sub> and I<sub>5</sub>). At\
    \ the later period, on the other hand, the EC reduction rate was relatively low\
    \ although rainfall was high. It is concluded that, irrigation with high saline\
    \ water (EC \u22657 dS/m) caused accumulation of salt in excess of that washed\
    \ out by monsoon rainfall.</em>"
