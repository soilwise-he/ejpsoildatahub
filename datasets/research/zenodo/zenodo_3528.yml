  title: Development of soil moisture measurement with wireless sensor web-based concept
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Measurement of soil moisture commonly by applying the soil moisture
    sensors is to measure the condition of the ground around which is relatively not
    wide. Therefore if applied for the large-scale, repeated measurements are required
    in accordance with the determined point. As a result it takes time to get the
    whole results. With the existence of wireless sensor technology then this problem
    can be overcome. This wireless sensor system will create a network consisting
    of nodes and server. In this study the server part is a server computer that requires
    a web server application together with its script to display and store data, while
    the node part is the data reader system. In the data system reader module, the
    sensor device is required as the input that is SEN0114, the processor is a microcontroller,
    while the wireless uses Wi-Fi module that is ESP8266. Wi-Fi topology used later
    is infrastructure (using access points). In this research, it begins by testing
    the sensor and then testing the data validation between the node and the server.
    SEN0114 sensor has different value from the American Standard Method (ASM) that
    is 0.922%. While the data validation test of the measurement result is Wi-Fi ESP8266
    module which has a maximum distance of 14 meters toward the access points.&lt;/p&gt;'
