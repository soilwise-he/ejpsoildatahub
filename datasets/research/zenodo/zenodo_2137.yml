    \ Abstract The article studies the leading factors of influence on draining meliorations\
    \ in the Bahna Valley, such as soil cover and climatic conditions. The main types\
    \ of soils are determined: Gleysols Umbric, Gleysols podzolic; Gleysols ferrum\
    \ (rusty) podzolic; Podzoluvisols Stagnic; Phaeozems, slightly podzolic and sandy;\
    \ Gleysols Umbric and Fluvisols Umbric and peat; Gleysols podzolic surface-bogged.\
    \ It is established that the distribution of precipitation, which accounted for\
    \ the warm season (70-80% of the annual norm), was a key factor among the climatic\
    \ conditions in the region. It has been found that the valley may have a relative\
    \ humidity of more than 90% within 100 days of a year and a relative humidity\
    \ of 30% only within 20 days. The influence of Ukrainian Carpathians and adjoining\
    \ flat territories results in specific conditions of humidification. It has been\
    \ discovered that a great amount of precipitation (750-800 mm) and moderate annual\
    \ temperatures contributed to the accumulation of excessive moisture that led\
    \ to the boggy pedogenesis. The latter causes the formation of different swamped\
    \ and boggy soils. The prevalence of the oversaturated soils in Bahna valley determined\
    \ the need for drainage reclamation in the region. Key words: Bahna valley; drainage\
    \ reclamation; soil and climate conditions."
