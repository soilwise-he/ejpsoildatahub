  title: Phyto-Assessment Of Soil Heavy Metal Accumulation In Tropical Grasses
  abstract: 'Tropical grasses are fast growing and often used for phytoremediation.
    Three different types of tropical grasses: Vetiver (V. zizanoides), Imperata (I.
    cylindrical) and Pennisetum (P. purpureum) tested in different growth media of
    spiked heavy metal contents under the glasshouse environment of RimbaIlmu for
    60-day. The growth performance, metals tolerance and phyto-assessment of cadmium
    (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in shoots and roots were assessed using
    flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS).Tolerance index (TI), translocation
    factor (TF), biological accumulation coefficient (BAC), biological concentration
    factor (BCF), and uptake efficacy was applied to evaluate the metal translocation
    ability among all three grasses. All three grasses showed significantly higher
    (pPb&gt; Cd &gt;Cu. The results of study suggested that both Imperata and Pennisetum
    are commendable and potential phytoextractors for Zn as well as phytostabilizers
    for Cd, Pb and Cu, respectively'
