  title: Soil fertility analysis for rice production in the lowland areas of Diplahan,
    Zamboanga Sibugay, Mindanao, Philippines | IJAAR
  abstract: "The most important practice that contributes to rice production is nutrient\
    \ management. However, if the nutrient plant required is insufficient, low production\
    \ is unavoidable. Thus, this study was carried out to determine the soil fertility\
    \ status of lowland areas in the municipality of Diplahan. Soil samples from each\
    \ sampling site were collected in rice farms using a composite random soil sampling\
    \ moving in a zigzag pattern. A depth of 0- 15cm soil samples were collected from\
    \ 15 \u2013 30 different places in 1-5 hectares. An air-drying procedure was done\
    \ before it was carried to the laboratory for final testing. Soil samples were\
    \ analyzed for pH, organic carbon, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorous, and\
    \ potassium following the BSWM (Bureau of Soils and Water Management) procedures.\
    \ Furthermore, a soil fertility map was outlined through ArcGIS software by plotting\
    \ local coordinates in Google Map. Results showed that the areas in 10 selected\
    \ barangays in the municipality have moderate soil acidity, with a pH level that\
    \ falls below the desirable range of 5.5 \u2013 7.0 but no lower than 4.5. According\
    \ to the results of the soil organic carbon analysis, all barangays have insufficient\
    \ SOC. Only four barangays have the optimal soil organic matter content for lowland\
    \ rice production. The study also revealed that only two (2) barangays receive\
    \ an adequate amount of nitrogen, while the rest are considered deficient. Phosphorous-rich\
    \ soils were found in two (2) barangays; the five (5) barangays have a medium\
    \ content; and the remaining three (3) barangays have a low content. Lastly, no\
    \ barangay in the municipality obtains an adequate amount of exchangeable potassium\
    \ ranging from 82-246 ppm. Problem of insufficient nutrient requirements for rice\
    \ crop production is widespread in the municipality. Published by the <strong>International\
