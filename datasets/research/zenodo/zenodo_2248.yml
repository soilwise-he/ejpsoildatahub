  title: 'Alteration potential of Propylene microplastic on soil toxicity: impact
    of organic matter and aging of microplastics'
  abstract: 'Plastics occupy a large place in our daily life products and have also
    brought various environmental problems with their widespread use. Polypropylene
    (PP) is the dominant plastics that is used in the products. Cadmium and nickel
    occur in agricultural lands like microplastics and pose risk. The application
    of biosolids as organic fertilizers can lead to microplastics and heavy metals
    reaching agricultural lands. While microplastics are toxic on their own, due to
    their small size, high surface area, and hydrophobicity; they become more toxic
    to the environment as they are combined with metals that contribute to the bioaccessibility
    of the heavy metal. Also, aging causes the modification of surface characteristics
    and results a change in physicochemical properties and ecotoxicological effect
    of microplastics. This is the first study examining the ecotoxic effects of Cd
    and Ni metals on E. crypticus in the presence of PP microplastic, UV-aged PP microplastic,
    and biosolid application. The results show that the presence of aged PP microplastics
    in Ni EC50 is found 52 mg/L, and reproductive toxicity is found 75 mg/L of virgin
    PP and Ni together. Also, the combined toxicity of virgin PP + Cd is 139 mg/L
    and EC50 value of aged PP+Cd is found 122 mg/L. Also, it is proven that biosolid
    addition decreases toxicity for Cd and Ni sets together with PP microplastic.
    It has been suggested that the size of the microplastics may be appropriate for
    ingestion by the organism that increased toxicity with aged PP MPs and heavy metals
    together. The surface area of microplastic increases with aging, and this rough
    surface area also contributes to the increase in the adsorption capacity. The
    results of this study can support the rewarding strategies to accelerate the studies
    to understand possible ecotoxic effects of aged MPs with heavy metals in different
    ecosystems. Also see: https://micro2022.sciencesconf.org/426990/document'
