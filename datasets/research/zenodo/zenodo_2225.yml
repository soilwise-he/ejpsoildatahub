  title: Coupling Novel Soil Moisture-Suction Sensors and UAV Photogrammetry Technology
    to the Performance of Highway Embankments
  abstract: The movement of water plays a critical role in the mechanical performance
    and service life of transportation infrastructure, especially for pavement subgrades
    and highway embankments consisting of high-plasticity, expansive soils that saturate
    and ultimately lead to infrastructure distress. Shallow slides along highway embankments
    are ubiquitous across Region 6 because long-term wetting and drying cycles considerably
    weaken these compacted soils. In the aftermath of heavy rains, pore-water pressures
    increase to a critical threshold such that a failure occurs. The implications
    of embankment failures range from repeated maintenance repairs to long-term road
    closures. A comprehensive approach to model highway embankments comprising of
    laboratory testing, setup, and field data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles
    has been proposed in this study.
