  title: Open Soil Atlas - Citizen Science Project for Testing and Measuring Soil
    Fertility in Berlin
  abstract: In this paper, we analyzed the result from 77 datasets were collected
    by citizen scientists. In a final analysis, it was concluded that mostly all sites
    that are not being actively regenerated show a certain amount of soil degradation.
    As soil samples were taken only at specific points, they are still not representative
    of the overall state of soils of Berlin. Further testing is needed and the possibility
    for scaling up the results achieved in this 6-months accelerator is promising.
