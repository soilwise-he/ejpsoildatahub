  title: Effect of Soil Algae on Maize Crop of Sangola Tahasil
  abstract: "Abstracts:The present study shows algal studies in maize field of Sangola\
    \ \_tahsil that to sustain the agriculture efficiency, it becomes authoritative\
    \ to take care of soil health and environment. Sustainable crop production is\
    \ imaginable when the natural resource on which the production activity depends\
    \ is not eroded or harmed in any manner, which will damage it or jeopardize production\
    \ and progress at any time in future. Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) are microscopic\
    \ single-celled organisms that grow naturally in soil, fresh and salt waters the\
    \ results obtained. It can be concluded that the application of BGA treatment\
    \ was more effective in increasing the growth and productivity without any detrimental\
    \ effect on maize crop.\_"
