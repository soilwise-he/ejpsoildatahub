  title: "Podzolisation, Peat Development And Dopplerite \u2013Soil Characteristics\
    \ Of A Challenging Profile At The Ramskapelle Polder (West Flanders-Belgium)."
  abstract: The soils characteristics of a complex soil profile along a Belgian gas-pipeline
    are presented in this paper. The thorough field observations, the mesomorphological
    and micromorphological studies and the soil analyses permitted to reconstruct
    important changes in the studied landscape and to unravel the fingerprints of
    the significant see-level rise which followed the deglaciation. Among the studied
    features the presence and the environmental significance of the dopplerite is
    also considered in this paper.
