  title: Effect of the Soil Amendments on the Mechanical Harvest of Potato Crop Grown
    under Centre Pivot Irrigation System
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A field trial was conducted at TADCO to evaluate the mechanical
    harvest of autumn potato crop under different soil amendments: sand, gypsum, cow
    manure, and granular sulfur. The application of the sand amendment to the soil
    of the pivot showed easier mechanical and semi-mechanical harvest. The potato
    yield under the mechanical harvest was less than semi-mechanical harvest by 15.48%
    at the different soil amendments. More bruises were observed on the potato tubers
    harvested by mechanical harvest which ranged 9.34-16.33%, while bruises at semi-mechanical
    harvest ranged 4.28-4.75%. The final yield of stored potato was less than harvested
    yield by 10.68, 7.78%, 14.85, 11.08 for the sand, gypsum, cow manure, and sulfur
    amendments respectively. The stored yield of the different treatments was significantly
    less than the yield of the test harvest by around 24.03-32.24% at J34 and by 29.64
    -56.27% at F18 and this was due to harvest method, cleaning out the damaged potato
    and moisture loss. The results of this trial highlighted the importance of selecting
    pivots for growing potato to be with less clay and more sand; also, it highlighted
    the importance of leaving the wheat straw to decompose in the soil instead of
    burning to improve the soil structure to be suitable for mechanical harvest. The
    sand amendment was not suitable for TADCO crop production as it is difficult to
    apply, need more time to execute besides less productivity. Due to one-month delay
    in planting potato, the average yield of stored potato from the trial pivots reached
    20.2 M.T. /Ha which is significantly less than the yield of stored potato from
    the other pivots at TADCO of the same season with a range of 27-43 M.T. /Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
