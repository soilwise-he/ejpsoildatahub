  title: The Relationship between Several Biological and Chemical Soil Properties
    to Maize Productivity in Kecamatan Cibugel, Kabupaten Sumedang
  abstract: '&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Maize was a crucial staple crop and played a pivotal role in the food
    security. However, the productivity of maize remained insufficient to saturate
    the market demands. Improving maize productivity can be achieved on the available
    land by considering the soil characteristic. One of the impediments encountered
    in the challenges of maize productivity was the lack of information regarding
    the interaction of biological and chemical soil parameters that influenced maize
    productivity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the biological
    and chemical characteristics of the soil to maize productivity. The method in
    this study was descriptive and comparative. The methods in this study were descriptive
    and comparative. This study was conducted at 18 points located in Cibugel, Sumedang.
    The land used was a land unit sampling based on slope, elevation, climate, and
    maize production area. The parameters carried out in this study consist of&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Azotobacter&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;sp.,
    fungi, soil organic C, total N, and C/N ratio. Soil samples were collected using
    composite sampling and analyzed in the laboratory. Statistical analysis was conducted
    by correlation analysis using Smartstat XL and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Excel
    2019&lt;/em&gt;.&nbsp;The result showed that there were correlations among various
    soil chemical and biological properties. Specifically, there were relationships
    between fungal populations with soil organic C and C/N ratio, and soil pH with
    total N.&lt;/p&gt;
