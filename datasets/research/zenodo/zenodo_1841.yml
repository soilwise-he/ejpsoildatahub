  title: Comparative Performance of Spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) as Affected by Growing
    Media Hydroponics Vs. Soil
  abstract: Shrinking land resources, increasing residual toxicity load and depleting
    levels of safe water for drinking and agriculture have made it really challenging
    to ensure availability of safe food to ever growing population. Maintaining production
    and productivity through traditional agriculture system have become tough. Globally,
    one technology has been accepted as sustainable technology to tackle all these
    issues is Hydroponics (soil-less cultivation) which not only offers safe food
    but also ensures vertical utilization of space with higher water utilization efficiency
    and also mitigate environmental issues associated with crop productions. Results
    of present experiment have revealed that crop productivity under hydroponics system
    was more than 2 to 3 times over soil with better quality produce. Ascorbic acid
    and total chlorophyll content were the highest in the hydroponically grown spinach
    respectively (26.05mg/100g and 2.05mg/ gFW).Spinach crop under hydroponics system
    developed profuse root system with average root length more than 15.40 cm almost
    60 per cent superior over soil grown system. This paper deals with comparative
    performance of spinach under various growing systems.
