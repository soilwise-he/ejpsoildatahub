  title: Isolation and identification of a bacterial strain from soil for bioremediation
    of phenol for pollution control

    \ <em>E-mail</em>: sunitapramanik@gmail.com <em>Manuscript received online 21\
    \ December 2019, accepted 23 March 2020</em> Phenol is one of the most widely\
    \ distributed environmental pollutant found in industrial wastewater capable of\
    \ causing harm to flora and fauna. These hazardous compounds can be removed from\
    \ the nature by various ways but one of the most efficient methods is bioremediation.\
    \ In order to isolate most potent bacterial strain from soil sample, was collected\
    \ from the hospital area and enriched regularly with 500 ppm phenol for 10 days.\
    \ After serial dilution isolated colonies were transferred to slant. Screening\
    \ was done to isolate most potent strain. Residual phenol concentration was estimated\
    \ spectrophotometrically. The strain marked as P108 was found having almost 98.08%\
    \ of phenol removal efficiency in 24 h at 37\xBAC temperature and pH 6.8. Morphological,\
    \ Biochemical, 16S rDNA Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis was conducted to characterize\
    \ and identify the strain. It was found that the isolated Pseudomonas sp. P108\
    \ strain have a significant similarity with Pseudomonas <em>otitidis</em> strain\
    \ MCC10330. The isolated strain was acclimatized in minimal salt media (MSM) for\
    \ about 2 months in 700 ppm phenol concentration for better efficiency."
