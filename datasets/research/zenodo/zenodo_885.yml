  title: Sentinel-2 Recognition of Uncovered and Plastic Covered Agricultural Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Medium resolution satellite data, such as Sentinel-2 of the
    Copernicus programme, offer&lt;br&gt;

    great new opportunities for the agricultural sector, and provide insights on soil
    surface characteristics&lt;br&gt;

    and their management. Soil monitoring requires a high-quality dataset of uncovered
    and plastic&lt;br&gt;

    covered agricultural soil. We developed a methodology to identify uncovered soil
    pixels in agricultural&lt;br&gt;

    parcels during seedbed preparation and considered the impacts of clouds and shadows,&lt;br&gt;

    vegetation cover, and artificial covers, such as those of greenhouses and plastic
    mulch films. We&lt;br&gt;

    preserved the spatial and temporal integrity of parcels in the process and analysed
    spectral anomalies&lt;br&gt;

    and their sources. The approach is based on freely available tools, namely Google
    Earth Engine&lt;br&gt;

    and R Programming packages. We tested the methodology on the northern region of
    Belgium,&lt;br&gt;

    which is characterised by small, fragmented parcels. We selected a period between
    mid-April to&lt;br&gt;

    end-May, when active agricultural management practices leave the soil bare in
    preparation for the&lt;br&gt;

    main cropping season. The spectral angle mapper was used to identify soil covered
    by non-plastic&lt;br&gt;

    greenhouses or temporary soil covers, such as plastic mulch films. The effect
    of underlying soil on&lt;br&gt;

    temporary covers was considered. The retrogressive plastic greenhouse index was
    used for detecting&lt;br&gt;

    plastic greenhouses. The result was a high quality dataset of potential bare uncovered
    agricultural&lt;br&gt;

    soil that allows further soil surface characterisation. This offered an improved
    understanding of the&lt;br&gt;

    use of artificial covers, their spatial distribution, and their corresponding
    crops during the considered&lt;br&gt;

    period. Artificial covers occurred most frequently in maize parcels. The approach
    resulted in&lt;br&gt;

    precision values exceeding 0.9 for the detection of temporary covers and non-plastic
    greenhouses&lt;br&gt;

    and a sensitivity value exceeding 0.95 for non-plastic and plastic greenhouses.&lt;/p&gt;'
