  title: Priorities in soil health management for sustained ecosystem services in
    terms of crop protection
  abstract: Soil biota includes Micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi, etc.), Micro-fauna
    (protozoa, nematodes, etc.), Meso-fauna (acari, springtails, etc.) and Macrofauna
    (insects, earthworms, etc.). It also includes the roots that grow in the soil
    and interact with other species above and below ground. Soil communities are so
    diverse in both size and numbers of species, yet they are still extremely poorly
    understood and in dire need of further assessment. Research has been limited by
    their immense diversity and by technical problems. Groups such as viruses, algae,
    yeasts, myxomycetes, cyanobacteria, rotifers, aphids, gastropods, tardigrades,
    turbellarians and others, have been little studied and in generally restricted
    environments.
