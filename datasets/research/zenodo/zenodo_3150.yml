  title: Successful introduction of the decorative species from the collection of
    short-growing and soil-covering redivives in Donetsk Botanical Garden of the NAS
    of Ukraine
  abstract: "The range of tolerance to the thermal mode, contrast mode, ombromode\
    \ and cryomode for the species from the collection of short-growing and soil-covering\
    \ redivives of Donetsk Botanical Garden of the NAS of Ukraine has been determined.\
    \ It has been found that in terms of the thermal mode submesotherms, mesotherms\
    \ and macrotherms, whose area involves Western Europe, the Caucasus, Asia Minor,\
    \ the Balkans, the Crimea, the Mediterranian, Iran and the European part of the\
    \ former USSR, are best adapted to natural climatic conditions of the southeast\
    \ of Ukraine; in terms of continentality the best species are hemioceanists, subcontinentalists\
    \ and hemicontinentalists; in terms of the ombromode \u2013 subaridophytes, mesoaridophytes\
    \ and semiaridophytes; in terms of cryomode \u2013 hemicryophytes. It has been\
    \ suggested that suboceanists and oceanists are less well adapted to the conditions\
    \ of the southeast of Ukraine as opposed to hemioceanists, hemicontinentals and\
    \ subcontinentals. It follows that it is possible to anticipate successful introduction\
    \ of redivives whose area refers to the regions of the globe with the thermal\
    \ mode of 45 to 55 kcal\xB7cm<sup>-2</sup>\xB7year<sup>-1</sup>, the ombromode\
    \ of \u20131600\u2026\u2013200 mm of precipitation, the cryomode of +6 to \u2013\
    6 \xB0\u0421."
