  title: Static Axial Reciprocal Load Test of Soil-Cement Mixing Pile Applying as
    Permanent Pile
  abstract: The soil-cement mixing wall has previously been used as an earth retaining
    wall during excavations, and was treated<br> as a temporary structure. At present,
    a method has not been established for evaluating its assumed vertical bearing<br>
    capacity and tensile resistance when bearing a building body load or something
    similar. In recent years, rationalization<br> of the foundation structure, reduction
    of the environmental burden, and other needs have been rising, studies have been<br>
    proceeding into the application of soil-cement mixing walls as permanent piles.
    In addition, with the previously<br> temporary soil-cement mixing wall now being
    used as a permanent pile, it can be expected that eliminating the need<br> for
    new work and reduce construction expenses. This study aimed for the application
    of the embedded portion of soilcement<br> mixing wall as a permanent pile, and
    evaluated the magnitude of the bearing capacity and the tensile resistance<br>
    for assuming the failure between ground and pile in the static axial reciprocal
    load test for single soil-cement mixing<br> pile.
