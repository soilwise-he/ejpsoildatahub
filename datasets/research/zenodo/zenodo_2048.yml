  title: Appraisal of discrepancies of soil salinity between the southeastern and
    southwestern coastal regions of Bangladesh
  abstract: Bangladesh is a miniature country having an area of about 148,460 km2
    where the coastal area covers about 20% of the country and 30% of the net tillable
    area. The coast of Bangladesh is broadly divided into the deltaic eastern, deltaic
    central, and stable deltaic western regions respectively. The principal motive
    of this paper is to assimilate the soil salinity level between the eastern and
    western coastal regions and also between two divisions of the western coastal
    region and to detect and also exhibit the reason why the western coastal region
    has a larger scale salinity level than the eastern coastal region. Datasets have
    been collected from the Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI), Department
    of Environment (DOE), Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO), Bangladesh
    Water Development Board (BWDB), and MS Excel and ArcGIS techniques have been used
    to accomplish necessary calculations and datasets. According to the Soil Resource
    Development Institute (SRDI), Soil Salinity report of 2010, an analogy between
    the soil salinity class of diverse Upazilas of the western coastal region (mainly
    most of Khulna and Barisal Division) and eastern coastal region (mainly several
    districts of Chittagong Division) can be detected according to Sodium Absorption
    Ratio (SAR) values. Soil salinity can be mainly divided into five categories like
    very slightly saline (S1), slightly saline (S2), moderate saline (S3), high saline
    (S4), and extremely high saline (S5) soils. Barisal region comprises the highest
    S1 and S2 soil salinity category with an area of 166510 ha and 112540 ha respectively
    and the Khulna region contains the highest S3, S4, and S5 salinity class with
    an area of 94650 ha, 85210 ha, and 68390 ha respectively. According to the Soil
    Resource Development Institute (SRDI) report of 2010, an analogy of soil salinity
    between 1973, 2000, and 2010 in the coastal area can be unearthed and from the
    attained data it can be uttered that Barisal and Khulna region contains the highest
    S1 and S2 soil salinity category. S1 soil salinity area has incremented for Khulna
    (from 48.70 ha in 1973 to 110.38 ha in 2009) but has decremented for Chittagong
    (from 44.4 ha in 1973 to 40.41 ha in 2000) and Barisal Region (from 194.47ha in
    1973 to 138.4 ha in 2000) from 1973 to 2000. According to Soil Resource Development
    Institute (SRDI) Annual Report 2017-2018, some graphical datasets comprising electrical
    conductivity depending upon months from 2014- 2018 can be found for the Khulna
    region, and also datasets containing electrical conductivity from 2017-2018 can
    be found for Chittagong region. From these data, it can be detected that various
    Upazilas of the Khulna region like Batiaghata (Krishnanagar), Dumuria, Batiaghata
    (Fultala), and Mongla contain the highest electrical conductivity of 9.7 ds/m
    (April 2014), 10 ds/m (May 2017), 10 ds/m (May 2017), 22.5 ds/m (April 2016) respectively,
    where various districts of Chittagong region contain the highest electrical conductivity
    much lesser than the Khulna region like Shitakunda and Bashkhali have the highest
    electrical conductivity of 15.9 ds/m (March 2018) and 9.4 ds/m (March 2018) respectively
    but these values are much lesser than the electrical conductivity of Mongla region.
    And also, it can be found from the available data that peak electrical conductivity
    of soil in the Khulna region can be found mostly in April/May but in the Chittagong
    region it can be found mostly in February/March. In this paper, different processes
    have been demonstrated to mitigate soil salinity, and also some conceptual descriptions
    have been given about salinity-resistant crops.
