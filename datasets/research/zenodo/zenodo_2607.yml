  title: Two New Records of Aspergillus (A. penicilloides &amp; A. uvarum) From Rhizospheric
    Soil of Potato Crops of Chichawatni, Pakistan
  abstract: In this study two species of <em>Aspergillus</em> (<em>A. penicilloides</em>
    &amp; <em>A. </em>uvarum) belonging to family Trichocomaceae of filamentous fungi
    have been isolated from rhizosphere soil of potato crops of Chichawatni. For isolation
    of fungi, culturing methods including direct plate method and dilution plate method
    on PDA medium have been used. After obtaining fungal cultures, species have been
    characterized, described, illustrated and identified on morphological basis. Morphological
    study included macroscopic and macroscopic characterization of fungal taxa which
    are presented here as new records for Pakistan. Light micrographs of microscopic
    details of these taxa have also been provided.
