  title: EFFECTS OF TILLAGE METHODS ON SOIL INFILTRATION RATE IN UYO, NIGERIA
  abstract: "This study evaluated the effect of tillage methods on the infiltration\
    \ rate of a sandy loam soil in Uyo, Nigeria. Tillage treatments adopted include\
    \ zero \u2013tillage, crude tillage, plough alone and plough harrow tillage. The\
    \ result of the study revealed that the basic infiltration rates under zero crude,\
    \ plough and plough harrow tillage in a sandy loam soil in Uyo were 18mm/hr, 20mm/hr,\
    \ 21mm/hr and 24mm/hr respectively. A 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used\
    \ to test the significance difference between the average infiltration rates under\
    \ the different tillage treatments. The study showed that there is a significant\
    \ effect of tillage method on soil infiltration rate and soil infiltration rate\
    \ under different tillage treatment followed the order plough + harrow &gt; Plough\
    \ alone &gt; Crude tillage &gt; Zero tillage. The study recommends that farmers\
    \ in Uyo should endeavour to till their farm before planting at least with crude\
    \ tillage implement as it will help to pulverize the soil surface and make it\
    \ easier for irrigation and root penetration as well as root development."
