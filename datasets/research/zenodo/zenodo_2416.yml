  title: Effects of Land-use Types on Some Soil Properties in Tsinipanbe, Chunku,
    Wukari L.G.A, Taraba State, Nigeria
  abstract: 'This study aims to assess the effects of land use type on the properties
    of soil in this area. This study also aims to investigate the effects of long
    term cultivation on soil properties in the area. Design/methodology/approach:
    This study uses the soil samples from the study area, which were subjected to
    laboratory analysis to obtain the data of the physical, morphological and chemical
    properties of the soil in the area. The obtained data was processed through analysis
    of variance. Findings: The results of this study indicate that the soil morphology
    of the internal content of the land used generally appears to be very clear. It
    was also observed that sand dominated the soil in both the cultivated and fallowed
    land area of the studied pedons. The percentage base saturation mean indicates
    that the cultivated and fallowed land use is high and a bit acidic and the soil
    taxonomy shows that the soil in the area is Typic Kandiuustalfs of the order of
    Afisols'
