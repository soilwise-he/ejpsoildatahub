  title: Wetting-Drying Cycles Effect On Piles Embedded In A Very High Expansive Soil
  abstract: The behavior of model piles embedded in a very high expansive soil was
    investigated, a specially manufactured saturation-drying tank was used to apply
    three cycles of wetting and drying to the expansive soil surrounding the model
    straight shaft and under reamed piles, the relative movement of the piles with
    respect to the soil surface was recorded with time, also the exerted uplift pressure
    of the piles due to soil swelling was recorded. The behavior of unloaded straight
    shaft and under reamed piles was investigated. Two design charts were presented
    for straight shaft and under reamed piles one for the required pile depth for
    zero upward movement due to soil swelling, while the other for the required pile
    depth to exert zero uplift pressure when the soil swells. Under reamed piles showed
    a decrease in upward movement of 20% to 30%, and an uplift pressure decrease of
    10% to 30%.
