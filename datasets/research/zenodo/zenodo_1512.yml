  title: Modulus based Approach of Lateritic Subgrade Soil Strength Evaluation Using
    Light Weight Deflectometer
  abstract: Since density based approach of pavement evaluation have its own limitations,
    quality control procedures of compacted pavement layers across the globe is slowly
    shifting from density based to stiffness/strength based criteria. The stiffness
    based measurements are easy to measure and more reliable than the density based
    quality measurements. The light weight deflectometer (LWD), one of many cutting-edge
    methods for determining how stiff compacted layers are, is employed in this study
    as a quality control tool to evaluate the standard of compacted pavement layers.
    LWD was created to assess the soil's compacted surface stiffness. LWD gives in
    situ measurements of soil densification through deformation/deflection modulus.
    In this study influence of moisture variations on the strength of subgrade layer
    are studied with the help of LWD. For this purpose an earthen shoulder along the
    road section inside the RIT College campus was excavated to the subgrade depth.
    At the subgrade level, soil samples nearly of 15 grams were collected for finding
    out the moisture content at that particular instant. LWD test was done from which
    the resilient modulus of the surface under test can be estimated. LWD resilient
    modulus is influenced by several soil parameters such as grain size distribution,
    maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC).Variation of LWD
    modulus with dry density studied at different test locations. A regression model
    was developed between LWD modulus and the factors influencing LWD modulus such
    as fineness modulus and moisture content for various combinations of lateritic
    and silty soil blend.
