  title: 'Plant And Soil Biota: Crucial For Mitigating Climate Change In Forests'
  abstract: Interest in forestation is rising with increasing recognition that global
    changes can negatively affect plant diversity and ecosystem function. It is known
    that forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes
    and ecohydrology need substantially more research. Functional interactions among
    vegetation, soils, and hydrologic processes permit the trees to maintain their
    symbioses in the soil. However, global change affects forests and soil health,
    influencing the population, diversity and activities of soil microbes, including
    symbiotic fungal populations. Although plants are sessile organisms, selected
    agroforestry tree species (mycorrhizal dependent plants) can be employed in forestation
    to encompass environmental stresses increased by global changes. This review was
    done to explore current information on forest for mitigating climate change, with
    respect to the research results on soil microbiota and its hydrologic impacts.
    Thus, relevant findings related to the benefits of soil health are emphasized.
    Accordingly, I discuss interdisciplinary knowledge required to understand the
    potential of forest to mitigate climate change.
