  title: Invasive plant benefits a native plant through plant-soil feedback but remains
    the superior competitor
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Plant soil feedback (PSF) occurs when a plant modifies soil
    biotic properties and those changes in turn influence plant growth, survival or
    reproduction. These feedback effects are not well understood as mechanisms for
    invasive plant species. Eragrostis lehmanniana is an invasive species that has
    extensively colonized the southwest US. To address how PSFs may affect E. lehmanniana
    invasion and native Bouteloua gracilis growth, soil inoculant from four sites
    of known invasion age at the Appleton-Whittell Audubon Research Ranch in Sonoita,
    AZ were used in a PSF greenhouse study, incorporating a replacement series design.
    The purpose of this research was to evaluate PSF conspecific and heterospecific
    effects and competition outcomes between the invasive E. lehmanniana and a native
    forage grass, Bouteloua gracilis. Eragrostis lehmanniana PSFs were beneficial
    to B. gracilis if developed in previously invaded soil. Plant-soil feedback contributed
    to competitive suppression of B. gracilis only in the highest ratio of E. lehmanniana
    to B. gracilis. Plant-soil feedback did not provide an advantage to E. lehmanniana
    in competitive interactions with B. gracilis at low competition levels but were
    advantageous to E. lehmanniana at the highest competition ratio, indicating a
    possible density-dependent effect. Despite being beneficial to B. gracilis under
    many conditions, E. lehmanniana was the superior competitor.&lt;/p&gt;'
