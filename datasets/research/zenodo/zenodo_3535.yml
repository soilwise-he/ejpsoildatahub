  title: Comparative Analysis of TPH Degradation Rate Kinetics in Amended Polluted
    Soil
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nThe rate of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation\
    \ in soil amended with mash food wastes (MFW) and fish wastes (FW) was investigated\
    \ in this study. Experimental analysis was performed for a period of 56 days,\
    \ while samples were collected weekly for analysis. The first and second order\
    \ kinetic models were applied to study the TPH degradation rate. The result revealed\
    \ that the rate of TPH removed from the control sample was low compared to samples\
    \ amended by MFW and FW. Over 90% of TPH was removed from the amended samples,\
    \ while only about 48% was removed from sample under natural attenuation. Analysis\
    \ of the 1st and 2nd order kinetic models showed high correlation coefficient,\
    \ but the rate of TPH degradation was better interpreted by the second order kinetics.\
    \ The 1st order degradation rate constant\_ were recorded as 0.0422day-1 and 0.0430day-1\
    \ for soil amended by MFW and FW respectively, while in the 2nd order, the degradation\
    \ rate constant were as 1.0 x 10-5 kg.mg-1.day-1. The rate of TPH degradation\
    \ increased rapidly within the first 14 days to 237.961mg.kg-1.day-1 and 292.486mg.kg-1.day-1\
    \ in soil amended by MFW, while in soil amended by FW, it increased to 225.386mg.kg-1.day-1\
    \ and 262.390mg.kg-1.day-1 for the 1st and 2nd order models respectively. However,\
    \ the rate of TPH also decreased sharply after attaining maximum rate. Conclusively,\
    \ food and fish wastes are recommended for treatment of hydrocarbon polluted soil\
    \ as they increase TPH degradation rate. Also, the models could be useful, especially\
    \ during the design stage of a bioremediation process to predict the rate of TPH\
    \ degradation and time to achieve the bioremediation."
