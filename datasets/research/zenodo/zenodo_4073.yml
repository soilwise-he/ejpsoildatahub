  title: Effects Of Tillage And Oil Palm Bunch Ash Plus Poultry Manure On Soil Chemical
    Properties, Growth And Ginger Yield
  abstract: "Field experiments were carried out at Owo, southwest Nigeria to evaluate\
    \ the effect of different tillage practices (zero tillage with mulch (ZTM), row\
    \ tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT), and with or without oil palm bunch\
    \ ash plus poultry manure (OBA+PM) on soil chemical properties, growth and yield\
    \ of ginger. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete plot design\
    \ with three replications. Soil chemical properties, growth and fresh rhizome\
    \ yield reduced with frequency/intensity of tillage imposed while application\
    \ of OBA+PM increased them. Among the tillage practices, the highest fresh rhizome\
    \ yield (15.0t ha-1) was produced by ZTM which was significantly different from\
    \ other tillage practices. Among the tillage \u2013 OBA+PM combinations, the \
    \ most satisfactorily yield (20.1t ha-1) was produced by ZTM+OBA+PM while the\
    \ lowest yield (15.7t ha-1) was in CT+OBA+PM."
