  title: Artificial Intelligence Techniques Applied To Radarmeteorology And Soil Erosion
    Research
  abstract: Rainfall erosivity is a crucial parameter for soil erosion assessment.
    It can trigger topsoil removal, leading to loss of agricultural potential and
    land degradation. This paper describes a new approach to derive the value for
    rainfall erosivity from weather radar data by using distributed cellular agents.
    Rainfall energy is used in standard erosion formulas such as the Universal Soil
    Loss Equation (USLE) and its regional variants as a means to measure rainfall
    erosivity. To calculate erosivity values, rainfall data need to be recorded. In
    cases where the entire area of interest cannot be covered, interpolation from
    the available data becomes necessary. When convective rainfall events are to be
    analysed, both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution is advisable.
