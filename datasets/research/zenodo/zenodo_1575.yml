  title: Effect Of Treated Wastewater Irrigation On Heavy Metals Distribution In A
    Tunisian Soil
  abstract: "Treated wastewater (TWW) may contain toxic chemical constituents that\
    \ pose negative environmental and health impacts. In this study, soil samples\
    \ under treated wastewater irrigation were studied. For this purpose, six plots\
    \ were made in an irrigated area in north of Tunisia and treated with two water\
    \ qualities: fresh water (FW) and treated wastewater (TWW). Five soil depths were\
    \ used: 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-120 and 120-150 cm. The TWW irrigation increased\
    \ significantly (P\u22640.05) the soils\u2019 EC, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SAR, Cu,\
    \ Cd and Ni and had no significant (P \u22640.05) effect on the soils\u2019 pH,\
    \ Zn, Co and Pb contents. EC, Na, Cl, SAR, Zn and Co increased significantly with\
    \ soil depth. The results for K, Ca, Mg, Cd, Pb and Ni exhibited similar repartition\
    \ in different layers of soil. It was also shown that the amount of different\
    \ elements in soil irrigated with fresh water (FW) were less compared with the\
    \ control soil."
