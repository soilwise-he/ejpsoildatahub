  title: Method for predicting the dissemination of hazardous substances in the soil
    during long-term storage of galvanic waste
  abstract: "The problem of production waste storage in open areas of an enterprise\
    \ with a galvanic shop for the production of chips and microchips has been investigated.\
    \ The composition of the sludge obtained after sewage treatment of the production\
    \ of the copper line was investigated.\n\n\nThe aim of the article is to develop\
    \ a mathematical model for predicting the distribution of compounds with heavy\
    \ metals in the soil during long-term storage of galvanic sludge in open areas.\
    \ Modeling the process of movement of salts from the earth's surface into the\
    \ lower layers of the aeration zone occurs according to the laws of molecular\
    \ diffusion. The method is developed on the basis of a mathematical model that\
    \ makes it possible to estimate the spread over the depth of the ground and level\
    \ of soil salinity over time using initial information about soil structure and\
    \ its characteristics (molecular diffusion coefficient, volume humidity), annual\
    \ volumes and conditions of sludge storage in the enterprise. Restrictions are\
    \ set: the presence of harmful substances on the soil surface with a concentration\
    \ that exceeds the permissible level; inadmissibility of harmful substances to\
    \ aquifers.\n\n\nThe practical use of the method made it possible to identify\
    \ the main dangers during long-term storage of galvanic waste in open areas. The\
    \ dynamics of soil salinity levels and the depth of penetration of heavy metals\
    \ increase over twenty years of conservation has been determined, as well as the\
    \ possibility of hazardous compounds entering groundwater has been assessed.\n\
    \n\nPolyvinyl chloride packaging has a maximum life span of 15\_years. Waste should\
    \ not be stored in packages and in closed areas for more than 10\_years. According\
    \ to the prediction results, it can be stated that storage in landfills of galvanic\
    \ waste for more than 15\_years leads to significant salinization of the soil\
    \ and creates conditions for an emergency situation, which is caused by harmful\
    \ substances entering the water horizons.\n\n\nRecommendations for improving storage\
    \ conditions are given and the need for recycling of industrial waste is substantiated"
