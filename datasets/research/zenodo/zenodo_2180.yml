  title: Organic amendment treatments for antimicrobial resistance and mobile element
    genes risk reduction in soil-crop systems
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;Agricultural fertilization with organic amendments of animal origin
    often leads to antibiotic resistance dissemination. In this study, we evaluated
    the effect of different treatments (anaerobic digestion, biochar application,
    ozonation, zerovalent iron nanoparticle application, and spent mushroom substrate
    addition) on the resistome in dairy cow manure-derived amendments (slurry, manure,
    and compost). Anaerobic digestion and biochar application resulted in the highest
    reduction in antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE)
    gene abundance. These two treatments were applied to cow manure compost, which
    was then used to fertilize the soil for lettuce growth. After crop harvest, ARG
    and MGE gene absolute and relative abundances in the soil and lettuce samples
    were determined by droplet digital PCR and high-throughput qPCR, respectively.
    Prokaryotic diversity in cow manure-amended soils was determined using 16S rRNA
    metabarcoding. Compared to untreated compost, anaerobic digestion led to a 38%
    and 83% reduction in sul2 and intl1 absolute abundances in the soil, respectively,
    while biochar led to a 60% reduction in intl1 absolute abundance. No differences
    in lettuce gene abundances were observed among treatments. We conclude that amendment
    treatments can minimize the risk of antibiotic resistance in agroecosystems. &copy;
