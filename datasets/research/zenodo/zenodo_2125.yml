  title: Comparative Study of Soil Index Properties of Gudu Sokoto State And Oworoshoki
    Area Lagos State, Nigeria.
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The comparative study of the soils sample collected from Gudu
    and Oworoshoki area, Sokoto state and Lagos State&lt;br&gt;

    was carried out to compare the index properties of soil at shallow soil deposit.
    The Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to&lt;br&gt;

    locate the coordinates of the site. Shallow soil samples (disturbed and undisturbed)
    at different depths (1m, 2m and 3m) were&lt;br&gt;

    collected from both study areas (Gudu and Oworoshoki). The disturbed samples were
    collected using hand trowel, digger, hoe&lt;br&gt;

    and polythene bags while the undisturbed samples were collected using short pipes
    (samplers) by stroking each pipe into the&lt;br&gt;

    ground completely with a hammer at each depth. Disturbed and undisturbed soils
    collected at different shallow depths (1m, 2m&lt;br&gt;

    and 3m) were taken to the laboratory for natural moisture content, specific gravity,
    sieve analysis, Atterberg limits and unit weight&lt;br&gt;

    test. Empirical equations were used for analyzing the soil samples and AASTHO
    System of classification was used for classifying&lt;br&gt;

    the soil samples. The results of the test on Gudu soil samples has shown that
    the soil sample collected at depth 1.0m and 2.0m&lt;br&gt;

    are nonplastic materials and were classified according to AASHTO standard as A-3
    and sample at depth 3.0m as A-4 which is silty&lt;br&gt;

    soil while Oworoshoki soil samples has shown that Soils from depth 1.0m, 2.0m
    and 3.0m are nonplastic (NP) because the Plastic&lt;br&gt;

    Index (PI = 0) is zero and the soil samples are classified as A &ndash; 3 according
    to AASHTO standard.&lt;br&gt;

    &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;'
