  title: Upscaling for unsaturated flow including connectivity of the soil structure
  abstract: "Modelling of flow processes in the unsaturated zone on a large scale\
    \ requires often \nupscaling of the flow problem. The soil parameter distribution\
    \ is mostly not known, \nso that the upscaled problem is based on a characterization\
    \ of the soil \nheterogeneity, which is obtained from local measurements. Effective\
    \ flow parameters \nare therefore often derived in a stochastic framework, where\
    \ the heterogeneity of a \nfield is quantified by its second order stochastic\
    \ properties (the mean, variance \nand a two-point covariance model with an integral\
    \ scale and anisotropy parameters). \nA field has to be Gaussian to be quantified\
    \ completely by these parameters. However, \nsoil structure resembles rarely Gaussian\
    \ fields. It has connected and isolated \nstructures of different material types.\
    \ The connectedness of material has a large \ninfluence on the upscaled models,\
    \ yet these properties can in general not be derived \nfrom second order stochastic\
    \ field parameters. Therefore upscaling methods are \nneeded which take connectivity\
    \ into account.\n\nIn this contribution we first discuss how soil connectivity\
    \ can be quantified from \nlocal data in a reasonable way. We then discuss how\
    \ the information about \nconnectivity can be taken into account into the upscaled\
    \ models. This is done here \nby applying different effective medium approaches\
    \ to derive unsaturated effective \npermeability. The methods are all derived\
    \ assuming capillary equilibrium on the \nsmall scale. Effective parameters are\
    \ obtained using the self-consistent approach, \nthe Maxwell approach, the differential\
    \ effective medium approach and a generalized \npercolation approach. We compare\
    \ the methods and discuss their advantages and \nlimits. The results obtained\
    \ for different test fields are compared to the exact \nsolution for the effective\
    \ parameters, derived by homogenization theory."
