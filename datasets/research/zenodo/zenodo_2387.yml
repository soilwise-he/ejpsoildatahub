  title: Primary Screening Of Cellulase Producing Microorganisms From Soil Of Banana
    Cultivated Cropland For Saccharification Of The Agrowaste
  abstract: A total of forty microbial cultures having ability to utilize agro-waste
    of banana were isolated and screened for cellulase activity. The banana agro-waste
    is rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and minerals. These nutrients can
    be used for production of value-added products only after its bioconversion. To
    bring about this bioconversion, in present work, an attempt has been made to isolate
    cellulase producing microorganisms from the soil of banana plantation area of
    Nanded district (Maharashtra). Out of 40 isolates; three bacterial, five actinomycetes
    and two fungal isolates were found efficient for cellulase activity. Similarly,
    all these microbial isolates were screened for hemicellulase activity. The isolates
    efficient in cellulase production were also found efficient in hemicellulase production.
