  title: Transcriptomic responses of a simplified soil microcosm to a plant pathogen
    and its biocontrol agent reveal a complex reaction to harsh habitat
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Soil microorganisms\
    \ are key determinants of soil fertility and plant health. Soil phytopathogenic\
    \ fungi are one of the most important causes of crop losses worldwide. Microbial\
    \ biocontrol agents have been extensively studied as alternatives for controlling\
    \ phytopathogenic soil microorganisms, but molecular interactions between them\
    \ have mainly been characterised in dual cultures, without taking into account\
    \ the soil microbial community. We used an RNA sequencing approach to elucidate\
    \ the molecular interplay of a soil microbial community in response to a plant\
    \ pathogen and its biocontrol agent, in order to examine the molecular patterns\
    \ activated by the microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;A\
    \ simplified soil microcosm containing 11 soil microorganisms was incubated with\
    \ a plant root pathogen (&lt;i&gt;Armillaria mellea&lt;/i&gt;) and its biocontrol\
    \ agent (&lt;i&gt;Trichoderma atroviride&lt;/i&gt;) for 24\_h under controlled\
    \ conditions. More than 46 million paired-end reads were obtained for each replicate\
    \ and 28,309 differentially expressed genes were identified in total. Pathway\
    \ analysis revealed complex adaptations of soil microorganisms to the harsh conditions\
    \ of the soil matrix and to reciprocal microbial competition/cooperation relationships.\
    \ Both the phytopathogen and its biocontrol agent were specifically recognised\
    \ by the simplified soil microcosm: defence reaction mechanisms and neutral adaptation\
    \ processes were activated in response to competitive (&lt;i&gt;T. atroviride&lt;/i&gt;)\
    \ or non-competitive (&lt;i&gt;A. mellea&lt;/i&gt;) microorganisms, respectively.\
    \ Moreover, activation of resistance mechanisms dominated in the simplified soil\
    \ microcosm in the presence of both &lt;i&gt;A. mellea&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T.\
    \ atroviride&lt;/i&gt;. Biocontrol processes of &lt;i&gt;T. atroviride&lt;/i&gt;\
    \ were already activated during incubation in the simplified soil microcosm, possibly\
    \ to occupy niches in a competitive ecosystem, and they were not further enhanced\
    \ by the introduction of &lt;i&gt;A. mellea&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:\
    \ &lt;/strong&gt;This work represents an additional step towards understanding\
    \ molecular interactions between plant pathogens and biocontrol agents within\
    \ a soil ecosystem. Global transcriptional analysis of the simplified soil microcosm\
    \ revealed complex metabolic adaptation in the soil environment and specific responses\
    \ to antagonistic or neutral intruders.&lt;/p&gt;"
