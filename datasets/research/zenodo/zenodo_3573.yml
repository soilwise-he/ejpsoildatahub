  title: ESTIMATION OF SOIL ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY USING MLP, RBF, ANFIS AND SVM APPROACHES.
  abstract: The knowledge of soil electrical resistivity proves essential for a better
    earthing in order to ensure the protection of telecommunications and electrical
    energy networks. This study aims to estimate the value of the electrical resistivity
    of a site\\\\\\\'s soil from soil humidity and ambient temperature. The data used
    were measured at sites in the city of Lome and its surroundings. We developed
    models using Artificial Neural Network (precisely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    and Radial Basis Function (RBF)), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) errors
    obtained are 0.0011761% for the MLP model, 0.0719309% for the RBF model, 0.00105%
    for the ANFIS model and 2.89466% for the SVM model. We can say that the results
    are satisfactory for all models but the ANFIS model is better, given these performances
    compared to other models. The latter is then retained for the prediction of soil
    electrical resistivity.
