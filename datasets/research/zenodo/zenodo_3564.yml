  title: Utilization of Coir Pith for the Stabilization of Black Cotton Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Expansive soil deposits mostly appear in arid and semi-arid
    areas of the world and they pose severe difficulties to engineering constructions
    as they possess higher tendency to heave in the course of moist season and shrink
    at summer season. Construction in such highly expansive strata can be done by
    adopting ground modification techniques like soil stabilization, Vertical drains,
    inducing reinforcement in to soil etc., On the other hand with rapid industrial
    growth more quantity of industrial waste will be generated which will trigger
    several environmental issues when it is dumped in to environment. Utilization
    of industrial waste in construction industry without compromising in strength
    criteria is the best possible option for the engineers as the waste is used as
    construction material there will be no need for dumping yards, biodiversities
    can be protected, strength properties of the soil can be enhanced and hydraulic
    properties can also be modified by treating soil with industrial wastes. As the
    river sand can be partially replaced by some of the industrial wastes requirement
    for natural sand can be reduced which will not only economise the construction
    cost but also preserves the natural resources. The present study was carried out
    to assess the behaviour of coir pith treated black cotton soils. Due to increase
    in the natural fibres in many industries the waste produced from the coir industry
    is increasing, if proper care is not taken these waste may create severe effects
    on environment .To avoid disposal of this waste directly into environment it is
    better to use the waste in construction industry is a better option. But before
    adopting such practices proper studies are to be done to check whether these materials
    are suitable for treating the soils are not .In the present study by adding various
    proportions of coir pith Swell, strength characteristics of soil where compared
    for obtaining the optimum Replacement percentage.&lt;/p&gt;'
