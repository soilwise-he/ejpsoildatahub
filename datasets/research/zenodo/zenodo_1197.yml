  title: Analysis of Soil Stabilization by Utilizing Iron Mineral by Products Steel
    Slag
  abstract: 'The huge measure of modern waste as expanded step by step and transfer
    turns into an intense issue. it is important to use the steel slag waste. Steel
    slag is a result gotten from steel industry. It is created as a buildup during
    the generation of steel. Due to the high transfer cost as a waste material and
    the general positive highlights of steel slag, it has been pronounced a valuable
    development material. The measure of age is around 24 lacs mt for every year from
    various steel ventures in the india. The growing needs for fully furnished highways
    in the developed countries has led engineers to search for the durable cost effective
    measure for roadway construction. The basic necessity for suitable base course
    for roads is an important aspect in construction. The paper aims at utilizing
    the common waste materials for the improvement of roads. One such material that
    was analyzed in the paper for the execution of road work is the steel slag which
    is furnished in tones in the steel factories across the country. The use of the
    material is found to have improved the sub grade properties of soil to a good
    extent. Nitesh | Sumesh Jain "Analysis of Soil Stabilization by Utilizing Iron
