  title: 'Messor barbarus ants as soil bioturbators: Implications for granulometry,
    mineralogical composition and fossil remains extraction in Somosaguas site (Madrid
    basin, Spain)'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Few studies have inquired about the relationship between myrmecological\
    \ activity and the&nbsp;granulometry&nbsp;and&nbsp;mineralogy&nbsp;of sediments\
    \ of a palaeontological site. The objectives of this article are to determine\
    \ the sedimentological or mineralogical distinctions produced by ants of the species&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Messor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;barbarus&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;when\
    \ excavating their nests and extracting grains and vertebrate&nbsp;fossil&nbsp;remains\
    \ from the&nbsp;Miocene&nbsp;palaeontological site of Somosaguas (Madrid, Spain),\
    \ to evaluate the degree of taphonomic influence this myrmecological activity\
    \ has on the fossil remains, and to decide whether or not it can be used as a\
    \ tool for palaeontological prospection. Results show that&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Messor\
    \ barbarus&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;does not alter fossil remains when examined under a\
    \ 10&times; binocular magnifying glass. Ants preferentially extract from the&nbsp;ant\
    \ nest&nbsp;grains of medium sizes (0.25&ndash;2\u202Fmm) compared to the non-ant-modified\
    \ soils, and also extract a higher quantity of feldspars. These significant granulometric\
    \ and mineralogical modifications should be considered when carrying out compositional,\
    \ sedimentological or stratigraphical studies, since these can become biased and\
    \ alter geological interpretations as provenance or palaeoclimatic signal. Grain\
    \ size selection could be due to&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Messor barbarus&lt;/em&gt;' physical\
    \ capacities or the use of clay particles as cementing elements in nests. Mineralogical\
    \ distinction may be related to feldspars' embayments and pits filled with finer\
    \ material (mainly smectites), making transportation and pheromone impregnation\
    \ easier.&nbsp;Results show that the ant mounds had increasing concentrations\
    \ of fossil remains the nearer they were from the main excavation area, therefore\
    \ the study of ant mounds in potentially fossiliferous zones can indeed be used\
    \ as a new method of palaeontological prospection.&lt;/p&gt;"
