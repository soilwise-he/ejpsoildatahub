  title: SOIL FERTILITY REGENERATION USING SOME FALLOW LEGUMES
  abstract: "A field experiment was conducted at the Eastern farm of Michael Okpara\
    \ University of Agriculture, Umudike. The aim to determine the effects of some\
    \ Centrosema species: Centrosema brasilianum, Centresoma pascuorum, Centrosema\
    \ pubescens and natural fallow (as control) on available soil organic carbon,\
    \ organic matter, total nitrogen and available phosphorus. The experiment was\
    \ laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications and terminated\
    \ 14 weeks after planting. Results indicate that the Centrosema species showed\
    \ significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher percentage increase in organic carbon and organic\
    \ matter compared to the natural fallow. However, Centresoma pascuorum gave highest\
    \ significant values of organic carbon (0.98\xB10.01%), organic matter (1.69\xB1\
    0.01%), total nitrogen (0.11\xB10.00%) and phosphorus (11.60\xB10.31mg/kg). Plant\
    \ total nitrogen varied among species with Centrosema brasilianum giving highest\
    \ significant value of (2.82%). This study indicates that among the legumes studied,\
    \ Centresoma pascuorum was superior and should be used to enhance soil fertility."
