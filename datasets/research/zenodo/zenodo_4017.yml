  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Effects of soil chemical property on the hematology of Oreochromis
    niloticus in earthen ponds were investigated between March and August 2016. Three
    soil profile pits were dug side-by-side three existing earthen ponds in three
    different geomorphological locations of Imo state at Umuagwo, Ulakwo, and Uboma.
    Three homogenous soil horizons (0&ndash;20, 20&ndash;50, and 60&ndash;150 cm)
    were identified and evaluated for soil moisture, texture, and chemical composition
    using standard methods (USDA, 1971, Singer and Mum, 1996). 10 adults of O. niloticus
    of 250.0 &plusmn; 5.4 g average weight were randomly selected from each of the
    associated earthen ponds and chemically analyzed for nutrient composition in accordance
    with AOAC (2005). Soil texture was sandy at Umuagwo (sand: 798%, silt: 11.7%,
    and clay: 10.0%), sandy loam at Ulakwo (sand: 68.7%, silt: 16.0%, and clay: 15.3%),
    and clay loam at Uboma (sand: 32.8%, silt: 21.5%, and clay: 50.0%). The soil pH
    (4.0&ndash;4.5), organic carbon (0.4&ndash;0.6%), total nitrogen (0.04&ndash;0.08%),
    and exchangeable bases (Ca: 1.35&ndash;1.45, Mg: 0.05&ndash;1.60, and Na: 0.003&ndash;0.05
    m/100 g) recorded for the clay soil at Uboma were significantly higher (P &lt;
    0.05) than in other test soils. Hematological parameters of fish from the sandy
    soil (PCV 39.5 &plusmn; 3.0%, red blood cell [RBC] [2.78 &plusmn; 0.5 &times;
    106 cells/mm3], white blood cell [WBC] [45.7 &plusmn; 0.2 &times; 103 cells/mm2],
    and Hb [7.8 &plusmn; 0.8 g/dl]) did not significantly differ (P &gt; 0.05) from
    those of sandy loam (PCV [43.6 &plusmn; 3.6%], RBC [2.70 &plusmn; 0.6 &times;
    106 cells/mm3], WBC [45.0 &plusmn; 2.7 &times; 103 cells/mm3], and Hb [8.13 &plusmn;
    0.6 g/dl]) and clay loam soils (PCV was 43.2 &plusmn; 2.1%, RBC [2.80 &plusmn;
    0.01 &times; 106 cells/mm3], and Hb [8.13 + 0.6g/dl]). There was thus no discernible
    impact (P &gt; 0.05) in the blood of O. niloticus attributable to differences
    in soil chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;'
