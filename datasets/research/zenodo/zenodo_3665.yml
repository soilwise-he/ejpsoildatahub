  title: Examination of the Water and Nutrient Utilization of Maize Hybrids on Chernozem
    Soil
  abstract: "The research was set up on chernozem soil at the L\xE1t\xF3k\xE9p AGTC\
    \ M\xC9K research area of the University of Debrecen in Hungary. We examined the\
    \ yield, the yield production per 1kg NPK fertilizer and the water and nutrient\
    \ utilization of hybrid PR37N01 and PR37M81 in 2013. We found that PR37N01 produced\
    \ the most yield at the level of N120+P (17,476kg ha-1) while PR37M81 reached\
    \ the highest yield at level N150+PK (16,754kg ha-1). Studies related to yield\
    \ production per 1kg NPK indicated that the best results were achieved at level\
    \ N30+PK compared to the control treatment. Yield production per 1kg NPK was17.6kg\
    \ kg-1 by P37N01 and 44.2kg kg-1 by PR37M81. By comparing the water utilization\
    \ of hybrids we found that the worst water utilization results were reached in\
    \ the control treatment (PR37N01: 26.2kg mm-1, PR37M81: 19.5kg mm-1). The best\
    \ water utilization values were produced at level N120+PK in the case of hybrid\
    \ PR37N01 (32.1kg mm-1) and at N150+PK in the case of hybrid PR37M81 (30.8kg mm-1).\
    \ We established the values of the nutrient reaction and the fertilizer optimum\
    \ of hybrids. We discovered a strong relationship between the amount of fertilizer\
    \ applied and the yield produced (r2= 0.8228\u20130.9515). The best nutrient response\
    \ was induced by hybrid PR37N01, while the weakest results were reached by hybrid\
    \ PR37M81."
