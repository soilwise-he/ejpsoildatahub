  title: The Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Soil Fertility and Crop
    Production - A Review
  abstract: "Now a days, with the present rate of population growth and the scarcity\
    \ of food, it is imperative to boost soil fertility and agricultural output. For\
    \ crop plants to sustain their normal physiological processes, they need nitrogen,\
    \ phosphorus, and potassium. Fertilizers include all the components needed to\
    \ grow plants while enhancing the soil's chemical, physical, and biological qualities.\
    \ The organic fertilizers were highly effective, cost-effective, and easy to carry\
    \ around in large quantities. Similarly, inorganic fertilizers were known for\
    \ their high cost and negative environmental impact if improperly managed. The\
    \ impacts of both organic and inorganic fertilizers on crop productivity and soil\
    \ fertility were reviewed in the current study. Combining organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers builds soil health, increases the effectiveness of recommended inorganic\
    \ fertilizer use, and minimizes the cost of the latter type of fertilizer. Continuous\
    \ research and field trials are necessary to refine our understanding and practices,\
    \ ensuring the development of effective, environmentally friendly, and economically\
    \ viable fertilization strategies for sustainable agriculture\_"
