  title: Growth, Yield and Elemental Status of Lycopersicum esculantum L. Grown in
    Fly ash with Azosprillum amended Soil
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Fly ash (FA) from NALCO, Odisha (India) was used for amending
    soil at levels equivalent to 0, 5, 10, 20 40 and 80 T/H in which, tomato was grown
    and elemental residues of amended soil and plant were enumerated. In the present
    experiment Azosprillum mixed with graded levels of FA (5, 10, 20 40 and 80 T/H)
    to observe the role of Azosprillum in improving soil quality and reducing metal
    toxicity. FA amendments caused significant improvement in soil quality and germination
    percentage of tomato plants. Growth (seedling height, Shoot length, leaf number)
    and yield (number of fruits, fruit weight and fruits per plant) of tomato increased
    with an increase in FA amendments. In the present study fly ash neutralize the
    pH imbalance, increased EC, CEC, OC, P and some essential and nonessential micro
    elements i.e. Fe, Mn, Pb, Co and K. Further Azosprillum supplementations caused
    invariably increments in each growth parameters. The levels of 20 and 40 T/H FA
    were ideal for fruit yield. FA+ Azosprillum reduced heavy metal concentrations
    in both soil and plant. Hence, addition of bacterial species to FA may help in
    reducing the possible heavy metal toxicity of crop plants and can be used for
    solid waste management in Agro ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;'
