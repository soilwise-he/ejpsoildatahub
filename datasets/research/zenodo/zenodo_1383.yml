  title: The Comparison Of Simulation Methods For Backfill Soil Pressure  On Filled
    Shell Structures
  abstract: The article presents a comparative analysis of two computational methods
    modelling soil backing of large diameter shells with infill that are installed
    on the compressible base. The structure under consideration is a thin metal or
    reinforced concrete shell (usually cylindrical one) filled with soil of coarse
    fraction. Thin shells with infill are widely used in hydraulic, industrial, civil,
    and transport engineering. They are also used in various climatic conditions when
    constructing quays, piers, jetties, breakwaters, retaining walls, bridge foundations,
    and other facilities. At present, the possibility of their use in the reconstruction
    and development of structures of the Arctic ports is being considered. Of the
    two simulation methods of backfill soil as a part of numerical modelling of thin
    shell with infill, the principal one is that of modelling backfill soil as elasto-plastic
    medium. The Mohr-Coulomb model was chosen as the analytical one to describe the
    processes ongoing in the depth of soil. The simplified method of constructing
    assumes the simulation of backfill soil as a distributed load over the shell surface,
    whose value is determined by normative documents. The comparison of the calculation
    results has made it possible to estimate potential errors when using simplified
    methods of modelling loads.
