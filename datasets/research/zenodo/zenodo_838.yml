  title: Three new species of soil-inhabiting Trichoderma from southwest China
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;\n          Fungi in the genus Trichoderma are widely distributed\
    \ in China, including in Yunnan province. In this study, we report three new soil-inhabiting\
    \ species in Trichoderma, named as T. kunmingense, T. speciosum and T. zeloharzianum.\
    \ Their colony and mycelial morphology, including features of asexual states,\
    \ were described. For each species, their DNA sequences were obtained from three\
    \ loci, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the ribosomal DNA, the\
    \ translation elongation factor 1-\u03B1 encoding gene (tef1) and the gene encoding\
    \ the second largest nuclear RNA polymerase subunit (rpb2). Our analyses indicated\
    \ that the three new species showed consistent divergence amongst each other and\
    \ from other known and closely related species. Amongst the three, T. speciosum\
    \ and T. kunmingense belong to the Viride Clade. Specifically, T. speciosum is\
    \ related to three species \u2013 T. hispanicum, T. samuelsii and T. junci and\
    \ is characterised by tree-like conidiophores, generally paired branches, curved\
    \ terminal branches, spindly to fusiform phialides and subglobose to globose conidia.\
    \ In contrast, T. kunmingense morphologically resembles T. asperellum and T. yunnanense\
    \ and is distinguished by its pyramidal conidiophores, ampulliform to tapered\
    \ phialides, discrete branches and ovoidal, occasionally ellipsoid, smooth-walled\
    \ conidia. The third new species, T. zeloharzianum, is a new member of the Harzianum\
    \ Clade and is closely associated with T. harzianum, T. lixii and T. simmonsii\
    \ but distinguished from them by having smaller, subglobose to globose, thin-walled\
    \ conidia.&lt;/p&gt;"
