  title: Catalytic Degradation of Pentachlorophenol Contaminated Soil using Nano Zero-Valent
    Iron Catalyst
  abstract: "ABSTRACT\n\nPentachlorophenol (PCP) was widely applied in the industrial\
    \ or agricultural sector in the early days. After long-term abusive use of PCP,\
    \ the soil became contaminated. PCP is considered an \u201Cenvironmental hormone\u201D\
    \ in terms of toxicity identification; alkali-chlorine plants in Southern Taiwan\
    \ are those most polluted by PCP. This study first discussed the results of functional\
    \ group identification using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) performed\
    \ on three test soils. Next, it used the self-synthesized nano zero-valent iron\
    \ to observe its particle size distribution with a field emission scanning electron\
    \ microscope (FM-SEM). Furthermore, it conducted catalytic degradation reaction\
    \ on three test soils contaminated by PCP, to which different percentages of the\
    \ zero-valent iron by weight (wt%) were added, in order to explore the degradation\
    \ efficiency of the zero-valent iron over PCP.\n\nRegarding the degradation efficiency\
    \ of four different percentages of the zero-valent iron by weight (wt%) over PCP\
    \ in soil, the experimental results suggest that there are slight differences\
    \ in the degradation efficiency of different percentages of the zero-valent iron\
    \ by weight over soil contaminated by PCP at room temperature; the reaction rate\
    \ and degradation efficiency of the zero-valent iron over PCP in soil increase\
    \ as the amount of added zero-valent iron increases. This is largely because the\
    \ oxidation reaction between the zero-valent iron and PCP in soil is more significant,\
    \ while more electrons are released, when the content of the zero-valent iron\
    \ increases and the zero-valent iron reacts with the pollutant. Meanwhile, electrons\
    \ received by test soils relatively increase the reaction between these soils\
    \ and PCP in soil; they also replace the original ligands in soil, which enables\
    \ the effective degradation of concentrations of PCP in soil. Currently, the zero-valent\
    \ iron has been extensively applied to environmental pollution remediation, which\
    \ is especially effective for remediation of soil and groundwater pollution control\
    \ sites and restoration work."
