  title: Geosynthetics Stabilizers and Fly Ash for Soil Subgrade Improvement A State
    of the Art Review
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soft soil having a low bearing capacity is found in many parts
    of the world and construction on soft soil is a challenge. To overcome the situation,
    the soil needs to be stabilized with some external material like geosynthetic,
    fly ash and rice husk. Geosynthetics materials are tremendous materials used to
    solve many civil engineering problems. Fly ash is a byproduct produced by burning
    of coal and is available in various thermal power plant as a waste material. Disposal
    of fly ash is also a problem but in one area where it can be used is soil stabilization.
    A comprehensive review of published literature on the use of geosynthetic and
    fly ash to stabilize and enhance the strength of soil was carried out. The effect
    of using geosynthetic material and fly ash was investigated on the properties
    of soil like Optimum Moisture Content, Maximum Dry Density, California bearing
    ratio, unconfined compressive strength and compaction behavior of the soft soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
