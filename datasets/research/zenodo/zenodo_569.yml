  title: RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOIL RESIDUES AND THE COLLECTION SYSTEM
  abstract: The preservation and improvement of soil fertility is an urgent task today.
    To do this, it is necessary to plant intermediate and secondary crops between
    and after the main crops. This allows a large amount of organic residue to remain
    in the soil after harvest. As a result of their decay, the amount of soil humus,
    total and mobile nutrients increase.
