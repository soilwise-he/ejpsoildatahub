  title: Impact of different doses of deltamethrine on soil microbial density and
    crop growth
  abstract: The effects of agrochemicals pollution on soil nutrients, soil microbes
    as well as plants cultivated on the soil were studied. Insecticide and herbicide
    were used to impact on the soil samples across concentration gradients. Bean and
    maize seeds were planted in separate experiments to monitor the effects of the
    agrochemicals on the plants. The microbial diversity and the physicochemical characteristics
    of the soil before and after pollution were determined using standard methods.
    Chlorophyll contents of the leaves were also determined after planting. Results
    indicated that bacterial isolates such as <em>Enterococcus sp</em> 54(40%), <em>Staphylococcus</em>
    sp 8(13%), <em>Bacillus sp</em> 46(34%) and <em>Micrococcus sp</em> 15(11%) and
    fungal isolates such as <em>Penicillium sp</em> 41(34%), <em>Saccharomyces sp</em>
    67(56%), Yeast sp 4(3%), <em>Geotrichum sp</em> 6 (5%) and <em>Aspergillus sp</em>
    1(1.8%) were recovered from treated and untreated soil with the percentages representing
    after planting. From the results, the herbicide treated soils indicated that the
    Total Heterotrophic Bacterial Count (THBC) increased after cultivation while the
    Total Heterotrophic Fungal Count (THFC) decreased after cultivation. On the other
    hand, the insecticides treated soils recorded a general decrease in THFC and THBC
    after cultivation. The total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP) had no
    significant differences before and after planting while the exchangeable potassium
    (EP) had significant increase recorded after planting. Plants generally had poor
    growth characteristics recorded by stem girth and length, as well as chlorophyll
    content.
