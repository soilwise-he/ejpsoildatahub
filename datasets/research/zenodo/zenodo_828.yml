  title: Reserves of nutrients and soil organic components of Haplic Chernozems
  abstract: "The focus of this investigation is to present the reserves, soil nutrients\
    \ and organic matter components along the profile depth of Haplic Chernozems near\
    \ village Krupen, Kavarna municipality, South Dobrudzha region. The data confirm\
    \ our previous investigations that they are one of the most fertility soils in\
    \ Bulgaria. The profile is also marked by a variation of nutrients reserves according\
    \ to the genetic horizon. All investigated reserves gradually decreased which\
    \ is typical for the group of izohumic soils. The N<sub>total</sub> reserves varied\
    \ from 66.37% in \u0410<sub>horizon</sub> to 8.86% in \u0421<sub>horizon</sub>\
    \ of the total stocks counting to 3.247 kg/ha. The reserves of total phosphorus\
    \ in \u0410<sub>0-84 cm </sub>add up to 1.723 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which is 45.94%\
    \ from the total reserves of through profile, while in soil formation material\
    \ horizon (\u0421<sub>horizon</sub>) they reached to 0.782 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.85%).\
    \ The C<sub>org</sub> reserves in the study profile (0-195 cm) are 326.131 kg/m<sup>2\
    \ </sup>and 67.50% of the stocks are concentrated in the humus accumulative horizon.\
    \ In transition horizon (\u0412<sub>84-152</sub>) all nutrient reserves gradually\
    \ decreased and reached lowest values in soil formation material horizon (\u0421\
    <sub>152-195</sub>). These two genetic horizons have a higher degree of enrichment\
    \ of humus with nitrogen compared to the humus-accumulative horizon. Throughout\
    \ the depth of the profile, the degree of enrichment of humus with nitrogen is\
    \ defined as \"average\". We established essential correlations between the investigated\
    \ indices as follows: Reserves of C-total are in a strong correlation with reserves\
    \ of N-total (0.993**); Cres. (0.982**); C-<sub>THS</sub> (0.949**); Mineralization\
    \ ability after 56 days incubation (0.665**) and exchable potassium."
