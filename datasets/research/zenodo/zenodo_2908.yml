  title: 'A comparative study of thermally and chemically treated dairy waste: Impacts
    on soil phosphorus turnover and availability using 33P isotope dilution'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Dairy processing sludge (DPS) and DPS-derived secondary products
    such as struvite, biochar, hydrochar and ash (collectively known as SRUBIAS) are
    emerging as alternatives to fertilizers produced from mined rock phosphate. However,
    little is known about how these products affect soil P availability and daily
    P turnover rates.. A lack of such information prevents precision nutrient management
    planning using these products out on farms. This study used a novel isotope dilution
    technique (IPD) with&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P as a tracer to compare P
    turnover in soils amended with chemically (alum-treated DPS and struvite) and
    thermally (biochar, hydrochar, ash) treated DPS. Results showed that thermally
    treated products exhibited poor agronomic performance as P fertilizers, potentially
    inhibiting P availability when applied to soils. For example, a P deficient soil
    amended with hydrochar treatment at the highest application rates did not record
    a build-up of available P to agronomic target values. In ash and biochar treated
    P deficient soils, available P increased but only with very high application rates
    of 150 and 80&nbsp;mg&nbsp;P kg&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The application
    of these products as fertilizers could have negative implications for both environmental
    and agronomic goals. Conversely, chemically treated fertilisers demonstrated better
    agronomic performance. The same agronomic target value was reached with application
    rates of only 20&nbsp;mg&nbsp;P kg&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;soil
    for DPS and 50&nbsp;mg&nbsp;P kg&nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;soil
    for struvite. However, the techniques deployed revealed that these products exhibited
    slower rates of available and exchangeable P build-up when compared with chemical
    fertilisers. This suggests that these bio-based alternatives require higher application
    rates or earlier application times compared to conventional chemical fertilizers.
    Regulations providing advice on P use in agricultural soils need to account for
    slower P turnover in soils receiving recycled fertilizers. The IPD technique is
    transferrable to all wastes to examine their performance as fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;'
