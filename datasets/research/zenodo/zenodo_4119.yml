  title: Assessment of Soil Properties under Shifting Cultivation System of Farming
    in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;An assessment of soil properties under shifting cultivation
    system of farming in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Nigeria
    was carried out. The soil varied from sand, silt and clay in texture. The bulk
    density of the topsoil and subsoil was 0.95 and 1.231 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,
    0.1.78 and 1.2821 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.2431 and 1.388 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,
    respectively for the forest, fallow and cropping plots. The soil PH in the topsoil
    and subsoil was slightly acidicand tending towards neutrality (PH 6.0-6.88)forthe
    forest, fallow and cropping plots.Organic Carbon contentin the topsoil and subsoil
    ranged from 1.15-4.87%, Total Nitrogen content 0.074-0.246%, Available Phosphorus
    4.45-11.21 me/100g and Cation Exchange Capacity 3.95-10.69me/100g for the forest,
    fallow and cropping plots. Exchangeable Calcium, Sodium, Potassium and Magnesium
    ranged from 0.14-7.150 me/100g in the forest, fallow and cropping plots respectively.
    The soil properties are low in the fallow and cropping plots.&nbsp; Although,
    these soil properties are higher in the fallow plot than cropping plot. There
    is low inherent fertility in the cropping plot and would require improvement to
    support agricultural use. The study therefore recommends Organic matter input,
    mulching and crop residue management, as key to replenishing nutrient in the fallow
    and cropping plots.&lt;/p&gt;'
