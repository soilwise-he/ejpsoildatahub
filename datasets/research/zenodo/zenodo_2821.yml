  title: Differentiation of altitude-vegetation geosystems, taking into account the
    calculations of vegetation indices to improve the soil erosion monitoring system
  abstract: 'Vegetation cover is one of the main factors that cause soil erosion.
    The lack of permanent vegetation cover leads to extensive soil erosion. Since
    loose, dry, bare soil is the most susceptible to the erosion process. The article
    provides material on the possibilities of calculating the vegetation indices NDVI
    and SAVI using remote sensing images of the research object for 1990, 2000, 2010,
    2022. The results of the research made it possible to analyze the state of the
    flora distributed in the study area, as well as to develop measures aimed at protecting
    the flora. Based on the analysis of the vegetation cover, it can be concluded
    that for tree and shrub vegetation, the following were taken as the main features
    for assessing the soil-protective capacity: the crown density of the tree and
    shrub layer and the condition of the forest litter and ground cover.'
