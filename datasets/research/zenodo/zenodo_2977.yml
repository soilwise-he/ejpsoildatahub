  title: "Investigation on the performance of \u2018Fino\u2019 materials to stabilize\
    \ expansive soil: A case study in Yeka Sub-City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Expansive soil swells when it is wet, and it will shrink when
    it dries. Due to this behavior of the soil, the strength and other properties
    of soil are inferior. To improve its properties, it is necessary to stabilize
    the soil with different stabilizers. Soil stabilization is a process to treat
    the soil to maintain, alter, or improve expansive soil performance. In this study,
    the potential of &#39;Fino&#39; as stabilizing additive to expansive soil was
    investigated for the improving engineering properties of expansive soil to be
    used as subgrade material. The evaluation involved the determination of the Free
    Swell test, CBR test, Atterberg&#39;s limits, and the Proctor test of expansive
    soil in its natural state as well as when mixed with varying proportions of &#39;Fino.&#39;
    The practices were performed on six proportions 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30
    % with expansive soil. The research result indicated a considerable reduction
    in Swelling, and the Maximum dry Density of soil was improved. Optimum moisture
    content decreased in increasing &#39;Fino.&#39; At 30% of &#39;Fino,&#39; the
    CBR values of expansive soil increased from 1.06% to 5.94%, Liquid Limit decreased
    from 95.2% to 29.4%, plasticity index decreased from 57.24% to 17.82% and the
    degree of expansion of the natural subgrade soil has reduced from &quot;very high
    to medium.&quot; Hence, it is concluded that the &#39;Fino&#39; at 30% has shown
    significant improvement in the expansive soil&#39;s engineering properties meeting
    the ERA and AASHTO Standard specifications requirements for road subgrade material.&lt;/p&gt;'
