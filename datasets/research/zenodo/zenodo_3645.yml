  title: SOIL MAPPING OF BHEEMILI BEACH ROAD, VISAKHAPATNAM DISTRICT USING GEO-SPATIAL
    TECHNOLOGIES
  abstract: Soil survey is an integral part of an effective agricultural research
    and advisory program. It provides complete information about soils and is an inventory
    of the soil resource of the area. It gives the information needed for planning
    land use and soil management programs.The study area covers 236 sq.km with nine
    varieties of soilsin the area. These include the Black Clay Soil with high AWC,
    Brown Gravelly Clay Soil, Red Clay Soil,Red Clay Soil with high AWC, Red Clay
    Soil with Medium AWC, Red Coastal Clay, Red Gravelly Loam Soil, Red Gravelly Clay
    Soil and Red Loamy Soil.This study aims to use Remote Sensing and Geographic Information
    Systems (GIS) to produce the soil map and estimate the bearing values of different
    soils. All types of soils of the area have been considered in to GIS analysis.
