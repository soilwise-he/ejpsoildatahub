  title: Soil Fertility Indictors in Low-Input Agriculture in Communities of Southeastern
    Nigeria
  abstract: 'The study investigated the fertility of soils under <em>Caladium, Costus</em>,
    <em>Setaria</em> and <em>Imperata</em> in 10 locations of southeastern Nigeria.
    Soil samples were collected at random on soils formed over coastal plain sands
    of southeastern Nigeria. Soil samples were bulked, quartered and air-dried before
    laboratory analysis. Soil samples were sieved using a 2-mm sieve and analyzed
    for some soil fertility indices. Variation in soil fertility indices were computed
    using analysis of variance (ANOVA) while means were separated with least significant
    difference (LSD) at 5% level of probability. Calcium- magnesium ratios varied
    significantly (p=0.05) among plant species, and values ranged from 3.6 (<em>Caladium</em>).
    <em>Setaria</em> (1.9), <em>Costus</em> (1.7) and <em>Imperata</em> (0.8). Nitrate-nitrogen
    differed significantly (p=0.05) among plant species and distributed as follows:
    0.13 g/kg (<em>Caladium</em>), 0.12g/kg (<em>Setaria</em>), 0.11g/kg (<em>Costus</em>)
    and 0.08 g/kg (<em>Imperata</em>). Base saturation values decreased in the order
    of <em>Caladium</em> (56%), <em>Setaria</em>(49%), <em>Costus</em> (41%) and <em>Imperata</em>
    (21%). These soil parameters had significant (P&lt; 0.05) positive relationships
    with total carbon. It can be concluded that soils under <em>Caladium</em> can
    be used to infer greater soil fertility in farmland.'
