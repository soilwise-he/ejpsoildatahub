    Our society is very concerned about the rising levels of soil and ground water
    pollution brought on by anthropogenic percolation of heavy metals. Concentration
    of heavy metals are the major concern for the environment as they are toxic and
    non-biodegradable and having their high potential to pollute surface as well as
    underground water. Heavy Metals make the water unfit for plants and humans. It
    is discharged straight from zinc processing units, dyeing industries, galvanizing
    industries, and metal industries. etc. Different removal processes are applied
    to separate heavy metals from the effluents like phase separation, reverse osmosis,
    evaporation etc. However, these processes have some demerits, including a high
    reagent demand, erratic metal ion removal, the production of toxic sludge, etc.
    In this study, we have used adsorption process because it is easy to handle and
    simplicity and low cost. The research work is to determine the performance of
    laterite soil used as an adsorbent for removal of Zn &amp; Cu. To evaluate the
    adsorption capacity of soil, adsorption isotherms and kinetic studies were carried
    out at different starting concentrations of adsorbate (5, 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup>)
    at a constant pH of 8, with varied adsorbent doses (5, 10 g L<sup>-1</sup>), and
    an equilibrium contact period of 120 minutes. The adsorbent capacity of the adsorption
    process was determined using the linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich isotherm models.
    The Langmuir isotherm at a soil dose of 5.0 g L<sup>-1</sup> best matched the
    results of the Zn adsorption test, with R<sup>2</sup>=0.922 and RMSE=0.000962.
    Similar patterns were revealed by the results of a Cu adsorption test with adsorbent
    dose of 5 g L<sup>-1 </sup>having R<sup>2</sup>=0.989 and RMSE=0.000588.
