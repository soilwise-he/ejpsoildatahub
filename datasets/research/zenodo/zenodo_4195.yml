  title: Application Of A Modified Bcr Approach To Investigate The Mobility And Availability
    Of Trace Elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo,Ni, Pb, Zn, And Hg) From A Solid
    Residue Matrix Designed For Soil Amendment
  abstract: 'Trace element speciation of an integrated soil

    amendment matrix was studied with a modified BCR sequential

    extraction procedure. The analysis included pseudo-total

    concentration determinations according to USEPA 3051A and

    relevant physicochemical properties by standardized methods. Based

    on the results, the soil amendment matrix possessed neutralization

    capacity comparable to commercial fertilizers. Additionally, the

    pseudo-total concentrations of all trace elements included in the

    Finnish regulation for agricultural fertilizers were lower than the

    respective statutory limit values. According to chemical speciation,

    the lability of trace elements increased in the following order: Hg &lt;

    Cr &lt; Co &lt; Cu &lt; As &lt; Zn &lt; Ni &lt; Pb &lt; Cd &lt; V &lt; Mo &lt;
    Ba. The

    validity of the BCR approach as a tool for chemical speciation was

    confirmed by the additional acid digestion phase. Recovery of trace

    elements during the procedure assured the validity of the approach

    and indicated good quality of the analytical work.'
