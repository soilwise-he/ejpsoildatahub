  title: Temporal annual and seasonal NDVI variation of Sagarmatha national park,
    Nepal and its relationship with precipitation and soil moisture
  abstract: <em>The researches related to the national parks are important for detecting
    changes, managing and protecting resources in them. The vegetation change study
    is more vital as vegetation is the part of every ecosystems and functioning of
    the park. There had been limited study regarding vegetation changes and impact
    of climatic and environmental factor on greenery in Nepal. To fill this gap, our
    study applied satellite based NDVI, precipitation and soil moisture data to inspect
    changes in vegetation and their relation with climatic variables in Sagarmatha
    National Park (SNP). Our study revealed that the greenery contributors, forests,
    shrubs, grasslands and agricultural lands had increased during period of 2000-2018.
    These changes was due to reverse effect of both precipitation and soil moisture.
    In light of these findings, we assured that the greenery of the park was well
    preserved during these 18 years. Our research provided ecological and social implication
    for the SNP region as plan and polices regarding wellbeing of both vegetation
    and local dwellers could be formulated based on vegetation condition of park.
