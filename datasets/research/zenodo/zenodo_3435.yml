  title: Stabilisation of Clayey Soil with Shredded Tyre using Lime
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This research work has been done mainly on the compaction characteristic
    (OMC-MDD, UCS) and strength properties (CBR Values) of expensive soils such as
    clayey soil. The engineering strength properties of expensive soils (clayey soil)
    such as compaction characteristics and bearing capacity can be improved by stabilization
    process of the soil. These properties can be improved by controlled compaction
    using the mechanical equipment&rsquo;s or by addition of suitable admixtures like
    cement, fly ash, lime or by reinforcing the soil with shredded tyre, crumb rubber,
    plastic waste etc. But in recent years, tyre chips and lime are used very widely
    for stabilizing the soil, because these are economical than the other admixtures
    and are abundantly available in the market, so in this work lime treated shredded
    tyre has been used to improve the various strength properties of natural soil.
    Lime has been used as a binding material and also used for the treatment of the
    shredded tyre to make the tyre surface rougher. The objective of this work is
    to investigate the strength properties of natural clayey soil reinforced with
    different percentages of lime treated shredded tyre taken by the weight of natural
    soil and fixed percentage of lime as a binding material. A series of Standard
    Proctor Tests, Unconfined Compressive strength (UCS) tests and California Bearing
    Ratio (CBR) tests are being conducted on both the natural soil and reinforced
    soil with varying percentages of lime treated shredded Tyre (4%, 8%, 12% and 16%)
    by weight of natural soil and fixed percentage of Lime (10%).The value of MDD
    increases from 1.75g/cc to 1.93g/cc at 12% of tyre and 10% of lime , the value
    of UCS also increases from 3.35kg/cm2 to 5.63kg/cm2 at 12% of tyre and 10% of
    lime and the CBR value will also increase from 3.89% to 10.65% at 12% of shredded
    tyre and 10% of lime.&lt;/p&gt;'
