  title: Wood Ash in Canavalia ensiformis L. Cultivation on Highly Weathered Soil
    in Brazil
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The aim of study was to avaliate the productive and structural\
    \ features of &lt;em&gt;Canavalia ensiformis&lt;/em&gt; L. resulting from the\
    \ wood ash acting as a soil corrective and fertilizer in the Oxisol. The experiment\
    \ was performed in a greenhouse, from April to July 2012, in the Municipality\
    \ of Rondon\xF3polis, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The experiment, with Oxisol,\
    \ use as of six wood ash doses (0.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0 and 15.0 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;).\
    \ Harvesting of the &lt;em&gt;Canavalia ensiformis&lt;/em&gt; L. was done 60 days\
    \ post germination, in plastic pots of 4 dm&lt;sup&gt;-3 &lt;/sup&gt;capacity,\
    \ to which the wood ash doses had been administered 20 days prior to planting.\
    \ At the time of flowering, the following measurements were recorded, plant height,\
    \ indirect chlorophyll index of leaf, stem diameter, leaf number count, soil pH,\
    \ dry mass of shoot, dry mass of root, numbers and dry mass of the Rhizobia-rich\
    \ root nodules. The findings were then submitted to the analysis of variance and\
    \ regression test, up to &lt;em&gt;p=0&lt;/em&gt;.05 significance. The wood ash\
    \ acted as a corrective and induced a pH increase, enhancing the soil chemistry.\
    \ Influencing the number of leaves, dry mass of leaves and nodules. The other\
    \ variables analyzed, which were adjusted to the quadratic regression model, demonstrated\
    \ improved results when 9 to 12 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; of wood ash per\
    \ pot were added.&lt;/p&gt;"
