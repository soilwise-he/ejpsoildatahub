  title: Soil Organic Matter on Capillarity Control and Seepage Loss
  abstract: Department of Applied Chemistry, Calcutta University <em>Manuscript received
    2 September 1974; revised 4 April 1075; accepted 4 April 1975</em> Seepage causes
    water logging and the irrigable land becomes useless for cultivation specially
    in regions where there is chance of increase of son salinity, This may be minimised
    to some extent by application of humic acid, a son organic matter, which imparts
    water repellency to soil and exerts influence on capillarity.
