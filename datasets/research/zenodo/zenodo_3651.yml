  title: Physicochemistry Of Pozzolanic Stabilization Of A Class A-2-7 Lateritic Soil
  abstract: The paper examines the mechanism of pozzolan-soil reactions, using a recent
    study on the chemical stabilization of a Class A-2-7 (3) lateritic soil, with
    corn cob ash (CCA) as case study. The objectives are to establish a nexus between
    cation exchange capacity of the soil, the alkaline forming compounds in CCA and
    percentage CCA addition to soil beyond which no more improvement in strength properties
    can be achieved; and to propose feasible chemical reactions to explain the chemical
    stabilization of the lateritic soil with CCA alone. The lateritic soil, as well
    as CCA of pozzolanic quality Class C were separately analysed for their metallic
    oxide composition using the X-Ray Fluorescence technique. The cation exchange
    capacity (CEC) of the soil and the CCA were computed theoretically using the percentage
    composition of the base cations Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>
    and Na<sup>2+</sup> as 1.48 meq/100 g and 61.67 meq/100 g respectively, thus indicating
    a ratio of 0.024 or 2.4%. This figure, taken as the theoretical amount required
    to just fill up the exchangeable sites of the clay molecules, compares well with
    the laboratory observation of 1.5% for the optimum level of CCA addition to lateritic
    soil. The paper went on to present chemical reaction equations between the alkaline
    earth metals in the CCA and the silica in the lateritic soil to form silicates,
    thereby proposing an extension of the theory of mechanism of soil stabilization
    to cover chemical stabilization with pozzolanic ash only. The paper concluded
    by recommending further research on the molecular structure of soils stabilized
    with pozzolanic waste ash alone, with a view to confirming the chemical equations
    advanced in the study.
