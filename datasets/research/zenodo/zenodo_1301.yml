  title: Effect of Compaction and Leaching on Heat of Transport of Soil Water
  abstract: "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Bidhan Chandra\
    \ Krhhi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani-741 985<br> <em>Manuscript received 6 January\
    \ 1986, revised 17 December 1986, accepted 6 July 1987</em> Thermal diffusion\
    \ of water in an alluvial soil at various degrees of compaction and in a saline\
    \ soil, subjected to various degrees of leaching, has been studied. The heat of\
    \ transport was calculated by<em> </em>using a relation based on irreversible\
    \ thermodynamics. The results are interpreted in terms of the nature of interactions\
    \ of the diffusing soil \u2014water with the neighbouring soil particles."
