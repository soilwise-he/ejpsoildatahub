  title: Surface Runoff and Soil Organic Matter Availability in Bamboo-Based Agroforestry
    in Lombok Timur District
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Bamboo-based agroforestry is suitable for soils which are poor
    in nutrient. The characteristics of bamboo and the rapid closure of&nbsp; its
    canopy improve soil cover, soil nutrient availability and soil moisture&nbsp;
    content, &nbsp;and&nbsp; prevent &nbsp;erosion&nbsp; by reducing surface runoff.
    The &nbsp;research was aimed at determining the factors that influenced surface
    runoff and the availability of soil organic matter (SOM) in the bamboo-based agroforestry
    in East Lombok. Research was done from March 2010 to March 2011 in Lenek Daya
    village, Aikmel sub-district, East Lombok district. The research plots were located
    on slopes of 0-15o, 30-45o, and 45-65o; with bamboo canopy closures of 0-25%,
    25-50%, 50-75%, and over 75%. The research involving 12 plots, each in 4 x 12
    m size. Measurements included surface runoff, bamboo canopy closure, weeds and
    bamboo leaves litter weight, rainfall depth and duration, dissolved sediment,
    and soil physical and chemical properties as well as SOM. Correlation and multiple
    linear regression tests were used in data analysis. The results of the regression
    tests showed a change in surface runoff which was influenced by changes in bamboo
    canopy closure, rain duration, rain intensity and soil sand fraction, each by
    -0.019, 0.418, 0.049 and -0.065 respectively. Rain duration was the highest influencing
    variable, whereas bamboo canopy closure significantly decreased surface runoff.
    Bamboo canopy closure had no correlation with the increase of SOM. But, the increase
    of SOM had correlation with the increase of &nbsp;soil cation exchange capacity
    (CEC). The positive impact of &nbsp;bamboo canopy closure&nbsp; on &nbsp;Regosol
    soil fertility in &nbsp;bamboo-based &nbsp;agroforestry land &nbsp;was determined
    &nbsp;by &nbsp;land management intensity which could increase the availability
    of SOM and decrease phosphorus element loss due to leaching of nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;'
