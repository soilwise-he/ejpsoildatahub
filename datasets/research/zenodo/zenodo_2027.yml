  title: Calibration of the SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithm to reduce bias
    over the Amazon rainforest
  abstract: "Soil moisture (SM) is crucial for the Earth's ecosystem, impacting climate\
    \ and vegetation health. Obtaining in-situ observations of SM is labor-intensive\
    \ and complex, particularly in remote and densely vegetated regions like the Amazon\
    \ rainforest. NASA's Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission, utilizing\
    \ an L-band radiometer, aims to monitor global SM. While it has been validated\
    \ in areas with low Vegetation Water Content (VWC) (&lt; 5 kg/m\xB2), its efficiency\
    \ in the Amazon, which has dense canopies and high VWC (&gt; 10 kg/m\xB2), is\
    \ uncertain due to scarce in-situ measurements. This study validates and analyzes\
    \ SMAP data in the Amazon, employing the single-channel algorithm (SCA) and adjusting\
    \ vegetation optical depth (\u03C4) and single scattering albedo (\u03C9), two\
    \ key vegetation parameters. It incorporates in-situ SM observations from three\
    \ old-growth rainforest locations: Tambopata (Southwest Amazon), Manaus (Central\
    \ Amazon), and Caxiuana (Eastern Amazon). There were substantial discrepancies\
    \ between SMAP and in-situ data. However, using calibrated \u03C4 and \u03C9 values,\
    \ characterized by a lower \u03C4, results in better agreement with in situ measurements.\
    \ The study emphasizes the pressing need for innovative methodologies to accurately\
    \ assess SM in high VWC regions like the Amazon using SMAP data."
