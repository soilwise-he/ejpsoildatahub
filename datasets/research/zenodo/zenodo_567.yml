  title: Obscure soil microbes and where to find them
  abstract: Many soil bacteria and fungi remain unclassified at the highest taxonomic
    ranks (e.g. phyla level), which hampers our ability to assess the ecology and
    functional capabilities of these soil organisms in terrestrial ecosystems globally.
    The first logical step toward the classification of these unknown soil taxa is
    to identify potential locations on Earth where these unclassified bacteria and
    fungi are feasibly most prevalent. To do this, here I used data from a global
    soil survey across 235 locations, including amplicon sequencing information for
    fungal and bacterial communities, and generated global atlases highlighting those
    soils where the percentages of taxa of bacteria and fungi with an unknown phyla
    are expected to be more prevalent. Results indicate that soil samples with the
    largest percentage of fungal taxa with an unknown phyla can be found in dry forests
    and grasslands, while those with the largest percentage of bacterial taxa with
    an unknown phyla are found in boreal and tropical forests. This information can
    be used by taxonomists and microbiologists to target these potentially new soil
    taxa.
