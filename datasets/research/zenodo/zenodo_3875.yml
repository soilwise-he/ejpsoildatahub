  title: Isolation And Biochemical Characterization Of Chrome Resistant Bacteria From
    Soil Samples Of Muslim Bagh Mines
  abstract: In the biosphere, chromium is widespread heavy metal occurring in trivalent
    chromium (Cr3+) and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) forms. Trivalent chromium has been
    extensively used in different industries. Hexavalent chromium is an environmental
    pollutant, toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic metal whereas trivalent form is less
    soluble in water and even an essential nutrient. The distinctive capability of
    different isolated bacterial species, to reduce hexavalent chromium into trivalent
    form is going to be used in bioremediation. The present study was aimed to isolate
    and identify chromium resistant bacteria species from chromium mines. Random samples
    (n= 3) were taken and biochemical test were applied to identify chromium resistant
    bacterial species. Four bacterial species, belonged to genus Bacillus (iso-four,
    seven, eight, nine) were identified as B.pumilus, B.circulans, B.subtilis and
    B.sphaericus respectively. Isolates belonged to genus enterobacter (iso-one and
    iso-five) were identified as salmonella enteric and E.arogenes respectively. Isolate
    belonged to genus arthrobacter (Iso-three) was identified as A. creatinolyticus.
    Isolate belonged to genus pseudomonas (iso-two) was identified as p.fluorescene.
    Isolate belonged to genus staphylococcus; (iso-six) was identified as S.aureus,
    while iso-ten belonged to micrococcusluteus. All the isolates showed ability to
    tolerate chromium but iso-eight B.subtilis showed highest resistance against chromium.
    Furthermore, these bacterial species alter hexavalent Cr into trivalent Cr. This
    ability is being used on commercial scale to remove or minimize chromium pollutants.
