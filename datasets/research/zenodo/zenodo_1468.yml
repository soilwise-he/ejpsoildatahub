  title: HF-free microwave assisted dissolution of soil samples for quantitative assessment
    of potassium
  abstract: "Department of Environmental Science, University of Calcutta, 35, Ballygunge\
    \ Circular Road,<br> Kolkata-700 019, India<br> Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics,\
    \ 1/AF, Bidhannagar, Kolkata-700 064, India<br> <em>E-mail</em> : susanta.lahiri@saha.ac.in\
    \ HF-free microwave assisted soil dissolution method has been developed for potassium\
    \ analysis using HNO<sub>3</sub> and HClO<sub>4</sub>. The developed method will\
    \ be helpful for K analysis by AAS, ICP-OES or ICP-MS. Twelve soil samples were\
    \ subjected to digestion in microwave digester for extracting out potassium. Even\
    \ after vigorous digestion, about 20% residue was observed. It has been confirmed\
    \ by \u03D3-spectrometry with the help of highly shielded high-purity Germanium\
    \ (HPGe) detector that the residue does not contain any <sup>40</sup>K, which\
    \ in turn suggests that the total K has been transferred to the solution."
