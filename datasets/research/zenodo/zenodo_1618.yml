  title: The Effect of a Combination of Soil Improvers and N, P, K Fertilizers on
    P-Potential, P-Available, P Uptake, and Rice (Oryza Sativa L.) Yield in Inceptisols
    Soil from Jatinangor
  abstract: "Inceptisols are an order of soil that has great potential to be used\
    \ as productive land for rice cultivation because of its wide distribution in\
    \ Indonesia. However, this land order has low soil fertility so it is necessary\
    \ to fertilize to increase soil fertility. Balanced fertilization with soil improvers\
    \ and N, P, and K fertilizers can be applied to increase fertilization efficiency.\
    \ This experiment aims to obtain the dose of soil improver and N, P, K fertilizer\
    \ that has the best effect on P-potential, P-available, P-uptake, and rice yield.\
    \ The experiment was carried out from July to December 2023 at the Soil Chemistry\
    \ and Plant Nutrition Laboratory Experimental Garden, Faculty of Agriculture,\
    \ University of Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Sumedang. The experimental design used\
    \ was a Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) with seven treatments and four\
    \ replications consisting of control; N, P, K recommendations; soil improver;\
    \ \xBD soil + \xBE dose of N, P, K; \xBE soil improver + \xBE dose of N, P, K;\
    \ 1 soil improver + \xBE dose of N, P, K; 1 \xBD soil improver + \xBE dose of\
    \ N, P, K; 1 soil improver + 1 dose of N, P, K. One dose of soil improver is 8000\
    \ kg ha-1, while one dose of N, P, K fertilizer is 350 kg ha-1 Urea, 50 kg ha-1\
    \ SP-36, and 50 kg ha-1 KCl. The experimental results showed that the treatment\
    \ of 1 \xBD soil improver + \xBE dose of N, P, K was the best treatment for increasing\
    \ the weight of 100 grains."
