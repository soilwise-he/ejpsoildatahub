  title: Determine Elements Concentration In Soil Using Xrf
  abstract: "In this study, soil samples were taken from the state of AL-Gazeera-Sudan\
    \ to detect the concentration of minerals in it. The first sample was taken from\
    \ the surface and the second from a depth of 20 cm.\n\n \n\nThe samples were first\
    \ prepared by mixing with wax (3: 1). The mixture then crashed until it became\
    \ homogenous. The mixture then compressed into a piston and finally the sample\
    \ was tested using the XRF. The high-concentration elements in the sample were\
    \ identified by analysis and found to belong to clay minerals (geology) and found\
    \ high concentration metals such as silicon dioxide - iron oxide (3) - aluminum\
    \ oxide (2). Some of the elements are very small concentration and some are almost\
    \ non-concentrated and are associated with the existing samples (Cobalt 4 and\
    \ Chlorine). No significant concentration of minerals has been obtained and therefore\
    \ can be classified as agricultural, residential"
