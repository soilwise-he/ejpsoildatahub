  title: Origins of the Soil Survey of Scotland 50 cm threshold to define a Peat soil
  abstract: The technical note described the origins of the 50 cm threshold used in
    Scotland to define a peat soil. These soils are required to have more than 35%
    organic carbon in the layers from the soil surface to at least 50 cm depth and
    is unique in the definition of peat soils. The origin of this depth threshold
    arose from work in the 1940s and 1950s by the Scottish Peat Committee, a government
    body that evaluated peat deposits for commercial use and was adopted by the Scottish
    Peat Survey and later by the Soil Survey of Scotland in the late 1960s/early 1970s.
    This report was funded by the Rural &amp; Environment Science &amp; Analytical
    Services Division of the Scottish Government.
