  title: A Review on Biological Process for Improvement of Soil Properties in Geotechnical
    Engineering
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The biological processing of soil, also termed as the bio-mediated
    soil improvement method, is known to improve the engineering properties of soil
    and other construcation materials in terms of their environmental sustainability
    and performance. This paper reviews the soil microorganism process and other environmental
    factors that affect their metabolic activities and their geometric compatibility
    with the soil particle sizes. Two approaches are practiced in geotechnical engineering;
    biologically-induced and biologically-controlled mineralization. Environmental
    and other factors that may be encountered in situ during microbially induced calcite
    precipitation (MICP) and their influences on the process were identified and presented.
    Improvements in the engineering properties of soil such as strength/stiffness
    and permeability as evaluated in some studies were explored. Potential applications
    of the process in geotechnical engineering and the challenges of field application
    of the process were identified.&lt;/p&gt;'
