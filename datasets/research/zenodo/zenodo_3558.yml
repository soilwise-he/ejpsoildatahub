  title: 'Review : The Impact of Biochar Application in Remediation of Contaminated
    Soil'
  abstract: 'Biochar is the carbon rich co-product of pyrolysis or gasification of
    biomass. In order to remediate contaminated sites, bioremediation has often been
    employed successfully. The utilisation of biochar in such contaminated sites is
    suggested to be an important tool to enhance remediation by governing the mobility
    and fate of the pollutants as a soil amendment. When biochar is incorporated into
    soil can retain nutrients and other organic compounds. Positive impacts of biochar
    amendment on soils include: increasing soil capacity to sorb plant nutrients,
    consequently reducing leaching losses of nutrients; decreasing soil bulk density,
    leading to less-compacted soil conditions favorable for root growth and water
    permeability; increasing the soil cation exchange capacity; increasing soil microbial
    activity and diversity; increasing plant available water retention; and increasing
    crop yields.'
