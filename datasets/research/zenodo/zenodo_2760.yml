  title: Effect of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) Content on True Particle Density and
    other Physical Properties of Sudan Savannah Entisols
  abstract: The study aimed to determine the effect of long-term cultivation and soil
    organic matter (SOM) content on the particle density (Pd) and other physical properties
    of an Entisols in Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teachings and Research farm.. Soil
    samples were taken from six different spots (A, B, C, D, E, and F) at the depth
    of 0-15 and 15-30 cm. The field experiment was laid in RCB design and replicated
    three times each at a depth, totalling 36 samples. Purposive random sampling was
    used at 50 m intervals from one spot to another. The results show that interaction
    between sampling spots and sampling depths of the soil was significant (p&lt;0.05)
    in terms of total porosity (TP), SOM content, bulk density (Bd), and Pd. Averagely,
    there was a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm in
    terms of TP, Bd, and SOM content with the higher values of TP and OM observed
    in the 0-15 cm depth. The results show that spots near the shelterbelt (C and
    E) had higher OM, TP, and lower Bd and Pd. In terms of the textural class, differences
    were also observed among the sampling spots with C and E having sandy loam while
    the remaining spots had sand texture. Pd was higher in lower OM spots (A, B, D,
    F). The study revealed that whenever the standard Pd value (2.65 Mg m-3) was used
    to calculate TP of the soil, particularly spot C and E, it is being overestimated
    by 2-3%. It is therefore recommended that OM and crop residues should be incorporated
    and returned immediately after harvesting to help improve the soil properties.
    When soil is rich in OM, it is recommended that constant value (2.65 Mg m-3) should
    not be used to calculate its porosity, but rather the actual (measured) Pd of
    the soil.
