  title: 'Producing Chrysanthellum indicum DC. (1836) on organic amended soil in dry-season:
    crop coefficient Kc and growing stages determination'
  abstract: "<em>An important concern has risen about the over exploitation of both\
    \ timber and non-timber products in West African Soudano-Sahelian countries. This\
    \ study focused on the determination of the crop growing stages and coefficient\
    \ Kc allowing the irrigation of Chrysanthellum indicum, an herbaceous threatened\
    \ plant frequently used in herbal medicine against heart and kidney diseases.\
    \ To obtain the Kc, three steps were undertaken. First, a weather station provided\
    \ the variables needed to calculate the reference evapotranspiration ET0. Secondly,\
    \ to ascertain scientifically the results, the experiment runs nine lysimeters\
    \ to determine the crop maximum evapotranspiration ETM. A well-drained loam with\
    \ 8.1\xB11.6% of organic matter content was used within the replications. The\
    \ water-balance providing ETM used irrigation I and drainage D measured every\
    \ two days. Finally, the definition ETMloc = Kc\xB7ET0 was applied after the transformation\
    \ of ETM into local ETMloc. The results showed that the triplet {stage name; stage\
    \ duration (days); crop coefficient (Kc)} values are respectively {initial; 28;\
    \ 0.7\xB10.1}; {development; 17; 0.7-1.4\xB10.2}; {mid-season; 20; 1.4\xB10.2}\
    \ and {late-season; 14; 0.7\xB10.04}. The total growing period was found as 79\
    \ days. These results offer the possibility for a water-efficient production of\
    \ Chrysanthellum indicum in the dry season.</em>"
