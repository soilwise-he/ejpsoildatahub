  title: NOR-V SOIL BIOCARE SET
  abstract: "Due to soil problems, humans have invented fertilizers. Nowadays, using\
    \ chemical substances to improve<br> the efficiency of fertilizers has been a\
    \ choice instead of organic matter. However, the use of synthetic fertilizers\
    \ will<br> destroy soil organisms. As well as the nutrients, the soil organisms\
    \ are also essential for both soil and plant. When<br> the soil organisms have\
    \ been destroyed, the soil problems might reoccur. Contradicted to it, organic\
    \ fertilizers are<br> scientifically able to encourage the growth of soil organisms\
    \ thus fixing the soil problems. The study is conducted<br> to create a product\
    \ which is NOR-V SOIL BIOCARE SET that could increase living organisms in the\
    \ soil using<br> organic matters while improving soil fertility and plant health.\
    \ The effectiveness of the set has been tested on the<br> problematic soil samples.\
    \ The result showed that the properties of the soil such as pH, moisture, and\
    \ compaction have<br> improved to make them able to provide a good medium for\
    \ soil organisms\u2019 growth. The number of living organisms<br> in the soil\
    \ and the plant growth rate also increased rapidly after applying the product.\
    \ Overall, the product prioritizes<br> environmental sustainability and encourages\
    \ the public to reduce the use of harmful chemicals."
