  title: Design and Development of Soil Moisture Sensor
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Water is a very valuable and stimulating force for irrigation.
    The Optimum usage of water is an hourly requirement. Efficient irrigation helps
    to conserve water, increase plant yields, reduce fertilizer reliance, and improve
    the quality of crops. Various techniques are available to measure soil moisture
    content, both laboratory and field, including remote sensing, but the fastest
    and better one is with the use of soil moisture sensor electronic devices. The
    range of soil moisture sensors has its own benefits and drawbacks. The goal of
    this work is to design and develop a module for the measurement of soil moisture
    and temperature levels, as well as ambient temperature and humidity by using frequency
    concepts. The sensor is made of a corrosion resistant element and it is rugged,
    battery operated, low power and long range sensor using IoT. A &ldquo;GND BLE
    Mobile Application (gSense100)&rdquo; has been developed, which includes everything
    related to the BLE technology and soil moisture sensor, where the app uses BLE
    technology to transmit all sensor values to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;'
