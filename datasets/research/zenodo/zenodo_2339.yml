  title: A systematic review of biochar as a soil amendment and bioremediation tool
    in agricultural management | JBES 2020
  abstract: In arid and semi-arid regions limited water inputs, lower soil organic
    matter and carbon decreases the soil moisture retention which makes soils of these
    regions difficult to sustain healthy crop. Moreover, intensive agricultural practices
    are depleting the soil of its organic matter and nutrients which is reducing the
    soil fertility even further. Pakistan has high rainfall variability during different
    seasons. The regions which remain dry in all seasons due to low precipitation
    are greatly vulnerable to drought. Organic farming provides a solution to mitigate
    this problem to some extent but in this case the yield is less as compared to
    the conventional agriculture system. Biochar serves as a novel method for increasing
    soil carbon content due to its enhanced carbon stability. Biochar being highly
    porous material has large surface area and it causes significant changes in soil
    physical properties such as water holding capacity, porosity, drainage and bulk
    density. Adding the biochar in soil have many advantages from reduction of pollutants
    and heavy metals concentration in soil, increasing soil carbon sequestration as
    a strategy to mitigate climate change and increased soil microbial diversity due
    to substrate enhancement. The incorporation of biochar in soil has a great impact
    on the soil texture, density, particle size distribution, and soil density and
    can be used as fertilizer to increase the crop yield due to its ability to slow
    release of the nutrients in soil.
