  title: Analysis of Paddy field Soil Samples from Bramhapuri  Tehsil of Chandrapur
    District in Maharashtra for its Physico-chemical parameters
  abstract: "Abstract\nIn the present study physico-chemical parameter study of village\
    \ paddy field soil samples from Bramhapuri Tahsil, District Chandrapur, Maharashtra,\
    \ India has been studied for the period of 2 years from January 2020 to January\
    \ 2022. Bramhapuri Tahsil has more than 80% area under rice cultivation ,and\_\
    \ total crop area is 294.23Km2.\_ Soil samples were collected from Surbodi, Kurza,\
    \ Bondegaon ,Kahali\_ and Khandala villeges of Bramhapuri taluka\_ to study the\
    \ physico-chemical parameters. The colour of soil from five sites was black ,Texture\
    \ of soil\_was clay, clay loam and\_ loam\_, The value of soil pH found to be\
    \ 6.8 to 7.3 .Electrical conductivity was range from 0.061to\_ 0.158 dSm-1 ,Total\
    \ Organic carbon was found to be\_0.47to\_0.59 %,Bulk density was found to be\_\
    1.46 to 1.94 g/cm3, Porosity was found to be\_21.9 to 27.0 %,available nitrogen\
    \ (N) was found to be 267 to 299 Kg/ha .available phosphorus(P) was range between\
    \ 34.5 to 45.8Kg/ha, available potassium(K) was range between 168 to 335Kg/ha\
    \ ,cation exchange capacity was found to be\_17.53 to 23.51 meq/100gm."
