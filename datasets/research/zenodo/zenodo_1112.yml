  title: High-resolution and three-dimensional mapping of soil texture of China
  abstract: "The lack of detailed three-dimensional soil texture information largely\
    \ restricts many applications in agriculture, hydrology, climate, ecology and\
    \ environment. This study predicted 90 m resolution spatial variations of sand,\
    \ silt and clay contents at a national extent across China and at multiple depths\
    \ 0\u20135, 5\u201315, 15\u201330, 30\u201360, 60\u2013100 and 100\u2013200 cm.\
    \ We used 4579 soil profiles collected from a national soil series inventory conducted\
    \ recently and currently available environmental covariates. The covariates characterized\
    \ environmental factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation\
    \ and soil conditions. We constructed random forest models and employed a parallel\
    \ computing strategy for the predictions of soil texture fractions based on its\
    \ relationship with the environmental factors. Quantile regression forest was\
    \ used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions. Results showed that the\
    \ predicted maps were much more accurate and detailed than the conventional linkage\
    \ maps and the SoilGrids250m product, and could well represent spatial variation\
    \ of soil texture across China. The relative accuracy improvement was around 245\u2013\
    370% relative to the linkage maps and 83\u2013112% relative to the SoilGrids250m\
    \ product with regard to the R2, and it was around 24\u201326% and 14\u201319%\
    \ respectively with regard to the RMSE. The wide range between 5% lower and 95%\
    \ upper prediction limits may suggest that there was a substantial room to improve\
    \ current predictions. Besides, we found that climate and terrain factors are\
    \ major controllers for spatial patterns of soil texture in China. The heat and\
    \ water-driven physical and chemical weathering and wind-driven erosion processes\
    \ primarily shape the pattern of clay content. The terrain, wind and water-driven\
    \ deposition, erosion and transportation sorting processes of soil particles primarily\
    \ shape the pattern of silt. The findings provide clues for modeling future soil\
    \ evolution and for national soil security management under the background of\
    \ global and regional environmental changes."
