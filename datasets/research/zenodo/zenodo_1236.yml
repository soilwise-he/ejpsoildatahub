  title: Germination response of Amaranthus caudatus L. to soil types and environmental
    conditions
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Little attention is being paid to Amaranthus caudatus in the
    Eastern Cape Province and other parts of South Africa as a vegetable that has
    huge potentials in bridging nutritional gap between the rich and the poor. This
    work investigated germination response of the plant to environmental conditions
    and variation in its germination characteristics at various depths in different
    soil types with the intent of complementing limited data available on the general
    agronomy of the species. At the end of the study, the highest germination was
    recorded at 25 &deg;C and under continuous dark conditions, although the seeds
    germinated well under a wide range of temperatures and other photoperiods. The
    species germinated under all seeding depths considered, though late emergence
    was observed at depths below 2 cm. In addition, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) interaction
    in pattern of germination was observed in three out of the five soil types tested,
    whereas the control (unfractionated) soil showed a highly significant (P &lt;
    0.01) interaction with the silt clay loam and loam soil. This overlapping interaction
    further confirmed that the plant has wide surviving capabilities in various soils
    and environmental conditions, hence, for optimum seedling emergence, it is recommended
    that A. caudatus be planted in a loamy soil maintained at 25 &deg;C in a continuous
    dark environment.&lt;/p&gt;'
