  title: Contaminated Soil Remediation With Hydrogen Peroxide Oxidation
  abstract: 'The hydrogen peroxide treatment was able to

    remediate chlorophenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel

    and transformer oil contaminated soil. Chemical treatment of

    contaminants adsorbed in peat resulted in lower contaminants-

    removal and required higher addition of chemicals than the treatment

    of contaminants in sand. The hydrogen peroxide treatment was found

    to be feasible for soil remediation at natural soil pH. Contaminants in

    soil could degrade with the addition of hydrogen peroxide only

    indicating the ability of transition metals ions and minerals of these

    metals presented in soil to catalyse the reaction of hydrogen peroxide

    decomposition.'
