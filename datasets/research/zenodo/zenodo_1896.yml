  title: Characterization and role of pendimethalin catabolizing bacteria isolated
    from agricultural soil in Bauchi, Bauchi state
  abstract: "The characterization and role of pendimethalin catabolizing bacteria\
    \ isolated in three agricultural soils in Bauchi state. Analyses of physico-chemical\
    \ parameters were carried out to further understand the soil environmental conditions\
    \ of the sampling sites. Aerobic heterotrophic counts on the sampling sites for\
    \ six (6) weeks were conducted and revealed increase of bacterial counts across\
    \ the weeks; with the first week having low bacterial count of 104.333(\xD710<sup>5</sup>\
    \ cfu/g) while week six (6) had the highest bacterial counts of 202.5(\xD710<sup>5</sup>\
    \ cfu/g). Among the sampling sites: B1 and B2 had the lowest bacterial count compared\
    \ to B3. This is as a result of the effects of herbicides accumulation in the\
    \ soil. Bacterial abundance across the sampling sites showed high percentage of\
    \ occurrence of <em>Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Morganella sp.</em>at (14.25%)\
    \ each; when compared to <em>Streptococcus sp</em>. and <em>Proteus sp.</em>at\
    \ (4.29%). The isolation of pendimethalin utilizing bacteria was conducted by\
    \ enrichment cycle using mineral salt media containing pendimethalin (mg/ml) as\
    \ a sole carbon source. Utilization patterns of pendimethalin degrading potentials\
    \ of bacterial strains was determined via growth, utilization patterns and higher\
    \ performance liquid chromatography analysis. Growth and utilization was monitored\
    \ using spectrophotometer at 600 nm. <em>Bacillus sp. </em>and bacterial consortia\
    \ showed high level of wavelengths at 0.424 and 0.481 respectively. High performance\
    \ liquid chromatography analysis was conducted for 72 hours based on the peak\
    \ reduction of standard pendimethalin and observed was a decrease in the area\
    \ of the peak. <em>Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp</em>. revealed the highest rate\
    \ of pendimethalin metabolism after 72 hours. Based on this research, indigenous\
    \ microorganisms can be used for decontamination of agricultural soil. The Nigerian\
    \ government and farmers at large should be careful on the type herbicides used\
    \ for agricultural practices. For it affects soil microorganisms and crops."
