  title: Agroforestry and the EU Soil Strategy 2030
  abstract: Agroforestry, as a sustainable land management practice, has been shown
    to have an important role in improving soil quality and health based on at least
    four decades of data gathered from the world over. A large body of papers (summarised
    in Dollinger and Jose 2018 Mayer et al 2022) reaffirms that agroforestry can improve
    the major measurable soil metrics that define soil health, and show that agroforestry
    has the ability to (1) enrich soil organic carbon better than monocropping systems,
    (2) improve soil nutrient availability and soil fertility due to the presence
    of trees in the system, and (3) enhance soil microbial dynamics, which would positively
    influence soil health. It is imperative that agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional
    land-use strategy, should receive increased attention in our policy discussion
    for the future of soil and soil health.
