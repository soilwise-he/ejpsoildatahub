  title: Factors Forming Soil Combinations and Comparative Geographical Approaches
    to the Study of Soil Cover Structure
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The comparative geographical approach to the study of soils
    consists in the parallel study of soils and soil formation factors at various
    points and in the analysis of their relationships. Compilation of profiles can
    be carried out in the office (if there is sufficient cartographic material) or
    on the basis of special field studies. Often both of these methods are combined:
    profiles of smaller scales are compiled in the office, and larger scales &mdash;
    on the basis of special field studies. Soil formation factors were also applied
    to these profiles (first of all, the relief that determined the profile line),
    while usually only those factors were applied that had a decisive influence on
    the differentiation of the soil cover, caused the emergence of soil combinations.&lt;/p&gt;'
