  title: 'Evaluation Of Heavy Metal Toxicity On Radish: Comparison Between Soil And
    Floating Hydroponics Systems'
  abstract: Two plant growing methods, namely use of soil and a floating hydroponic
    system, were compared in order to determine whether the response of radish to
    Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn was affected by the cultural system. Seed germination, plant
    biomass (root, shoot, hypocotyl), and heavy metal accumulation in different parts
    of the radish plants were monitored. The presence of heavy metals in the germination
    medium had no effect on seed germination, while the biomass of plants grown in
    hydroponics was negatively affected by the presence of metals in the nutrient
    solution. In both cultural systems, the amount of metals in roots, hypocotyls
    and shoots increased significantly with the increasing metal concentration in
    the growth media; the highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in the
    roots. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) values
    for the four metals were found to be considerably different between both growing
    systems. The different responses of plants suggest that in contaminated soils
    the plants are in the presence of lower quantities of available metals than those
    found in the corresponding substrates of the hydroponic system.
