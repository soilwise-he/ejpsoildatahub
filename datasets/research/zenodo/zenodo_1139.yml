  title: Validation of a spectrophotometric method for soil adsorption study of thiophanate-methyl
  abstract: 'Department of Chemistry, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla-171 005,

    <em>Manuscript received online 04 January 2012, revised 05 February 2012. accepted
    07 February 2012</em> With a view to study the fate of thiophanate-methyl in soil
    and the extent of surface and ground water contamination, the soil-adsorption
    of the fungicide on four Indian soils of different soil characteristics has been
    studied by using a batch-equilibrium method. A spectrophotometric methodology
    based on the reaction of the fungicide with copper(n) acetate in aqueous DMF solution
    to form yellowish green solution showing maximum absorbance at 395 om has been
    validated for the purpose. The leaching behaviour of the fungicide in terms of
    ground ubiquity score (GUS) has the value below 1.8, classifying thiophanate-methyl
    as non-leaching pesticide and hence it does not represent hazard to ground water
    contamination.'
