  title: Movement of Cu, Co and Zn through an undisturbed soil column in a constant
    flow condition
  abstract: Department of Chemistry, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya-824 234, Bihar,
    India<br> <em>Manuscript received 20 August 2010, revised 01 February 2011, accepted
    25 February 2011</em> Transport of some heavy metals (Cu, Co and Zn) through soil
    of four different locations of West Bengal have been studied by a column experiment
    in a constant now condition. The solute or ion now through soil column along with
    the solvent is complicated by factors like gravitational forces, diffusibility
    and dispersibility besides adsorption. The now rate through soil column is controlled
    by the soil texture. The question of leaching causing downward migration of heavy
    metal cations enriching the sub-soil jones is a domain of pollution studies. A
    mobility parameter for ions has been defined and with its help relative rate of
    migration of the ions was sought to be defined. All the three ions do not possess
    the same penetration and mobility characteristics. Some further work is called
    for to increase the scope of this investigation.
