  title: EFFECT OF FLY ASH ADDITION IN WEST JAKARTA CENGKARENG AREA SOIL ON CBR VALUE
  abstract: Jalan Raya Daan Mogot KM.14, Cengkareng, West Jakarta, has a type of clay
    soil where the soil is very sensitive to changes in water content; in dry conditions,
    it has a high carrying capacity, while in a saturated state, it has a low carrying
    capacity. This is characterized by road damage that occurs at the location when
    the rainy season arrives. One way to improve the base soil of the site is through
    the soil stabilization method with the addition of chemicals, namely fly ash.
    This study used fly ash as a stabilization material, namely by adding fly ash
    with a mixture variation of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% to the weight of soil samples
    with a watering period of 1, 7, and 14 days. The result of the CBR value without
    soaking (unsoaked) of the original soil of 2.933% of the land belongs to the very
    poor group because the value of CBR ranges from 0% to 3%. Then, it is necessary
    to improve the original soil with soil stabilization with variations in the rate
    and period of expansion. The results of the study of CBR value without soaking
    (unsoaked) with the addition of fly ash can increase the value of native soil
    CBR along with the addition of fly ash mix variation; however, variations of 15%
    and 20% decreased from day 7 to day 14 days. The maximum value occurs at a mixed
    variable rate of 20% with a 7-day watering age and a CBR value without soaking
    of 17.835%.
