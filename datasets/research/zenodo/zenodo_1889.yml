  title: Electrochemical Behaviour of Natural Humic and Hymatomelanic Acids Isolated
    from Diverse Soil Types of India
  abstract: Humic and hymatomelanic acids isolated from five different soils of varying
    organic matter contents were subjected to electrometric titrations. The electrometric
    studies, namely, those of interaction of the different humus fractions with bases
    and neutral salts, are clearly indicative of the polyelectrolytic behaviour of
    these high molecular acidic components. The similarity of the behaviour of natural
    humic acids with hymatomelanic acids was clearly noticeable, suggesting the genetic
    similarity between them.
