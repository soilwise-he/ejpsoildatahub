  title: A Semi-Cylindrical Capacitive Sensor Used For Soil Moisture Measurement
  abstract: Differing from the structure of traditional parallel plate capacitive
    sensor a semi cylindrical capacitive sensor has been introduced in this present
    work to measure the soil moisture conveniently. Here, the numerical analysis method
    to evaluate the capacitance from the semi-cylindrical capacitive sensor is analyzed
    and discussed. The changes of capacitance with the variation of soil moisture
    obtained linear in the nano farad range (nF) and which converted into voltage
    variation by using proper signal conditioning circuit. Experimental results depict
    the satisfactory performance of the sensor for measurement of soil moisture in
    the range of 0 to 70%. We investigated the linearity of 4% of FSO and sensitivity
    of 70 mV/unit percentage changes in soil moisture level (DB).
