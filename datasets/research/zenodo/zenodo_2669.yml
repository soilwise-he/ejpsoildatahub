  title: Analysis of Phytoremediation Potential of Crop Plants in Industrial Heavy
    Metal Contaminated Soil in the Upper Mures River Basin
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In many types of researches and studies including those performed
    by the sciences&nbsp;of agriculture and plant sciences, large quantities of data
    are frequently obtained&lt;br&gt;that must be analyzed using different data mining
    techniques. Sometimes data mining&nbsp;involves the application of different methods
    of statistical data analysis. Exploratory&lt;br&gt;Factor Analysis (EFA) is frequently
    used as a technique for data reduction&nbsp;and structure detection in data mining.
    In our survey, we study the EFA applied to&lt;br&gt;data mining, focusing on the
    problem of establishing the optimal number of factors to be retained. The number
    of factors to retain is the most important decision&lt;br&gt;to take after the
    factor extraction in EFA. Many researchers discussed the criteria&nbsp;for choosing
    the optimal number of factors. Mistakes in factor extraction may consist&lt;br&gt;in
    extracting too few or too many factors. An inappropriate number of factors&nbsp;may
    lead to erroneous conclusions. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art&lt;br&gt;related
    to this subject was made. The main focus was on the most frequently&nbsp;applied
    factor selection methods, namely Kaiser Criterion, Cattell''s Scree test, and&lt;br&gt;Monte
    Carlo Parallel Analysis. We have highlighted the importance of the analysis in
    some research, based on the research specificity, of the total cumulative variance&lt;br&gt;explained
    by the selected optimal number of extracted factors. The extracted factors must
    explain at least a minimum threshold of cumulative variance.&lt;br&gt;The ExtrOptFact
    algorithm presents the steps that must be performed in EFA for the selection of
    the optimal number of factors. For validation purposes, a case study&lt;br&gt;was
    presented, performed on data obtained in an experimental study that we made on
    the Brassica napus plant. Applying the ExtrOptFact algorithm for Principal Component&nbsp;Analysis
    can be decided on the selection of three components that were&nbsp;called Qualitative,
    Generative, and Vegetative, which explained 92% of the total&nbsp;cumulative variance.&lt;/p&gt;'
