  title: 'Environmentally-Mediated Epigenetic Effects: Uncovering The Fertile Soil
    In The Development Of Pediatric Cancer'
  abstract: Environmentally-induced epigenetic changes of gene regulation could result
    from chronic, lifelong exposure, to low doses of environmental toxicants, such
    as chemicals including, tobacco smoking and endocrine disrupting compounds, or
    to other environmental factors such as nutritional changes, and lifestyle-related
    conditions. These environmentally-acquired epigenetic marks may influence the
    control of gene regulation through DNA methylation, histone modification, or through
    a large set of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These epigenetic effects might be passed
    on to the developing embryo and child as inheritable non-genetic marks, which
    recapitulate previous lifelong history of exposure to environmental influences
    that start from the stage of primordial germ cell, passing through the maturing
    germ cell, and ending by the zygote stage. This involves the  paternally transmitted
    information on the sperm that contribute to modulating embryogenesis functions
    and later childhood development, in concert with, the maternally transmitted information
    encountered by the exposure to a large milieu of environmental factors either
    periconceptionally or during lactation period. This record was migrated from the
    OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down.
