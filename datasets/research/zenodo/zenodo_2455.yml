  title: 'Application Of Soil Information In Nigerian Agriculture: A Case Study Of
    Some Horticultural Farms In Ibadan, Oyo State.'
  abstract: Soil information is a critical element in any agricultural venture. It
    often provides the missing link between assumptions and actuality in agricultural
    and non agricultural land use. A field study was carried out to assess the effects
    of poor application of soil information and the present level of soil information
    and utilization among small scale horticultural crop farmers in Ibadan, Oyo state.
    Six candidate citrus trees each were selected from two citrus orchards planted
    on suitable and marginally suitable soils based on available soil survey information
    which was monitored over two seasons, while structured questionnaires were administered
    to get empirical data on land use by the farmers. There was over 35% yield difference
    and this was significantly different (P &lt;0.05) with loss of some trees after
    15 years of establishment of the orchard on marginally suitable soils. Mean yield
    per tree was 50.43kg and 30.12kg for suitable and marginally suitable plots respectively.
    None of the respondents sought professional advice on land use or have knowledge
    of previous land use type while the farms were not surveyed before use. 56.27%
    of the farmers do not carry out soil test while less than 10% of the farmers apply
    fertilizers suggesting nutrient mining with an average land use period of 14years.
    The findings of this work show that soil information is not adequately utilized
    among horticultural crop farmers in Oyo state. Therefore, there is need to enlighten
    farmers on the need for accurate soil information and application for enhanced
    horticultural crop production.
