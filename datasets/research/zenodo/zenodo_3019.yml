  title: Effect of understory vegetation management through liming and sewage sludge
    fertilisation on soil fertility and Pinus radiata D. Don growth after reforestation
  abstract: "Tree\u2013understory competition is one of the most important aspects\
    \ that control tree growth after reforestation. The relationship between trees\
    \ and the understory can be modified by improving acidic soils with lime and by\
    \ fertilisation. This experiment aims to evaluate the effect of\nsoil improvements\
    \ on the pasture\u2013tree relationship by liming and fertilisation on different\
    \ dates in a Pinus radiata-reforested area. Both lime and sewage sludge improved\n\
    soil fertility by increasing Ca and reducing Al in the soil. Initially, tree development\
    \ was reduced by lime, which improved the establishment of competitive grasses.\
    \ Tree growth in limed treatments did not initially respond to sludge inputs,\
    \ likely because both tree and grass roots\nshared the same soil depth layer.\
    \ Three years after establishment, the use of high doses of sewage sludge in limed\
    \ plots caused a growth rate similar to the best treatments of unlimed plots,\
    \ which grew with a poorly sown grass establishment. After 2 years of the experiment,\
    \ the presence of Erica woody shrub diminished tree development. High doses of\
    \ sewage sludge with lime, as well as high doses of sewage sludge without lime,\
    \ applied in April and low doses of \n ewage sludge without lime added in early\
    \ February improved tree growth. From a practical point of view, lime and sewage\
    \ sludge dose close to 100 kg total N ha-1 should be \n ecommended if a silvopastoral\
    \ system is established, as it enhances pasture production and tree growth."
