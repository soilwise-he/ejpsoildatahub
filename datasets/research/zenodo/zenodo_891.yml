  title: Remediation of cadmium from soil by surfactant Triton X-100

    2008, revised 3 August 2009, accepted 18 December 2009</em> This study focuses
    on batch experiments conducted to evaluate the potential of surfactant Triton
    X-100 to remove heavy metals from artificially contaminated silt soil. Sorption
    experiments were carried out by varying concentration or cadmium and pH on soil
    samples. The soil samples selected for decontamination study were artificially
    contaminated with 500 mg L<sup>-1</sup> cadmium solutions at pH 4 and 7. Non-ionic
    surfactant Triton X-100 was used to decontaminate the soil at different time intervals.
    In sorption experiments variation of cadmium remaining with different time intervals
    was non-linear. It was found that maximum sorption of cadmium occurs at pH 7.
    Sorption continues till day 10. In desorption of 500 mg L<sup>-1</sup> cadmium
    contaminated soil, maximum desorption occurs at pH 4. The decontamination efficiency
    range or surfactant for soil contaminated with 500 mg L<sup> -1</sup> of cadmium
    was found to vary from 63.7% to 75.5% depending on pH.
