  title: Isolation and Characterization of a novel Streptomycetes, Streptomyces banglaensis
    from Bangladeshi Soil
  abstract: "With an aim to isolate novel actinomycetes having antimicrobial and cytotoxic\
    \ properties, five colonies of actinomycetes were isolated from the soils collected\
    \ from the different locations of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh and designated\
    \ as ANTS-1 to ANTS-5. Among them ANTS-1 and ANTS-5 were selected for taxonomic\
    \ characterization and identification due to their antagonistic activity against\
    \ a series of test organisms. The taxonomic positions of the actinomycetes, ANTS-1\
    \ and ANTS-5 were clarified using a polyphasic approach. The strains were assigned\
    \ to the genus<em> Streptomyces </em>based on their phenotypic and cultural characteristics.\
    \ A partial sequence of 16S rDNA of the strain ANTS-1 was determined and compared\
    \ with other <em>Streptomyces </em>species in the NCBI database. Phylogenetic\
    \ analysis based on partial 16S rDNA sequence indicated that strain ANTS-1 was\
    \ most closely related to <em>Streptomyces griseoplanus</em> NBRC 12779 (98.93%),\
    \ <em>Kitasatospora arboriphila </em>HKI 0189 (97.35%) and<em> Streptomyces paucisporeus\
    \ </em>1413 (97.35%). However, the phenotypic properties and the nature of secondary\
    \ metabolite produced by the strain ANTS- 1 differed from closely related species\
    \ of <em>Streptomyces</em>. Thus, the strain ANTS-1 is considered to represent\
    \ a novel species of the genus <em>Streptomyces</em>, for which the name <em>Streptomyces\
    \ banglaensis</em> (GenBank accession JF812169) sp. nov. is proposed. The strain\
    \ ANTS-5 (GenBank accession JF812170) was identified as <em>Streptomyces </em><em>coelicolor</em>\
    \ (100%) based on the BLAST search of its 16S rDNA sequence and DNA homology experiment\
    \ of the forward sequence. The crude ethyl acetate extract obtained from the yeast-extract\
    \ glucose agar (YEGA) medium showed strong activity against pathogenic bacteria\
    \ and moderate activity against fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\
    \ and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract against the\
    \ test bacteria were in the range of 1-2 \xB5g/ml and 4-8 \xB5g/ml, respectively.\
    \ The LC<sub>50</sub> value of the crude extract against brine-shrimp nauplii\
    \ was only 0.4\xB5g/ml indicating its potent cytotoxic activity. Further, potato\
    \ disc antitumor bioassay was carried out at concentrations 0.025mg and 0.0125mg\
    \ and no tumor growth was visible in these concentrations and consequently ensuring\
    \ its strong antitumor property. However, three active compounds AS-1, AS-2 and\
    \ AS-3 were isolated from the fermentation broth of the strain ANTS-1. But less\
    \ activity was observed from AS-1 and AS-2 than AS-3 which was later identified\
    \ as Actinomycin D based on comparison of its <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR\
    \ with a <sup>1</sup>H-NMR of authentic Actinomycin D. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum\
    \ of AS-1 and AS-2 could not be interpreted due to the existing impurities. This\
    \ study indicates that new strains of <em>Streptomyces</em> are available in the\
    \ soil of Bangladesh and extensive research in this field may discover novel <em>Streptomyces\
    \ </em>species producing pharmaceutically important bioactive compounds."
