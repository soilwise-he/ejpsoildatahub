  title: Particle Crushing Effect on The Geotechnical Properties of Soil
  abstract: Foundations are considered as the backbone of a structure. Most of the
    times, the foundation is laid on the soil. For the foundation design of any structure,
    we need to know beforehand the soil conditions such as shear strength and permeability.
    These parameters help us determine the bearing capacity of the soil. The soil
    conditions are determined by performing various laboratory tests such as shear
    box test or triaxial shear test. However, we cannot design the foundation considering
    these data as the ground conditions will change once the loads are applied to
    the soil as there are some soil particles with angularity or sharp edges will
    break. Once they will break, soil conditions will not remain the same as they
    were before since the gradation will change. This work is carried out in order
    to know the impact soil breakage brings to the soil (granular soil). For this
    purpose, actual ground conditions were simulated in the laboratory by applying
    one-dimensional compression to soil particles for about 45 minutes in a Universal
    Testing Machine (UTM). Different crushing loads to soil particles were applied
    and the change in the soil behavior was monitored. It was found that due to particle
    breakage of soil, the engineering properties of sand altered. This research work
    aims to analyze the effect of particle breakage only in the case of sand.
