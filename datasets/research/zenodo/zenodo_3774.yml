  title: Residual effect of Organic Waste Amendment on Soil Productivity and Crop
    Yield -- A Review
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Fallowing has been an efficient balance and sustainable crop
    production system for soil productivity especially for tropical soils. The sustainability
    of this soil management option in south east Nigeria has drastically reduced to
    almost zero, hence the use of external inputs in the form of organic waste has
    become imperative. Organic waste has been used as soil conditioner since ancient
    times and its benefits are yet to be fully realised in crop production activities.
    Organic wastes release nutrients slowly and steadily, improve soil nutrient status
    and recycling, activate soil microbes, soil physical attributes, crop yield and
    good fruits often reflected by consumers, public health and environmental harmony.
    This paper reviews various contributions of organic waste to soil productivity
    and crop yield and its possibility in sustaining crop production activities in
    tropical soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
