  title: Detection and management of soil-borne pathogens in citrus using non-inorganic
    control practices under greenhouse conditions
  abstract: "Citrus fruits are among the priority crops for Uganda. Government has\
    \ invested significant resources to boost citrus production due to their potential\
    \ to increase household income, nutritional security and national exports. However,\
    \ soil-borne pathogens are among several biotic-factors significantly constraining\
    \ production. Whereas inorganic chemicals have been applied in the past, they\
    \ have potential detrimental effects. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in\
    \ the greenhouse of National Forestry Resources Research Institute (NaFORRI) at\
    \ Kifu - Mukono in 2020-2021 to determine dominant soil and Citrus pathogens and\
    \ test efficacy of different non-inorganic citrus pathogen control practices.\
    \ A randomized complete block design with five treatments replicated thrice was\
    \ used. The treatments included; hot water, heated wet-soil, fumigated soil, solarized\
    \ wet-soil, and untreated control. A total of 30 Citrus seeds per variety were\
    \ treated with sodium-hypochlorite-solution (1:7) before being sown. Soils from\
    \ above treatments were cultured on Potato and Sabouraud-Dextrose Agar (PDA and\
    \ SDA) and de\_Man, Rogosa and Sharp\_(MRS) agar. Results indicated that\_Aspergillus\
    \ niger\_was the dominant soil-borne pathogen identified in pure cultures. Others\
    \ included\_A. flavus,\_A. fumigatus,\_A. viridinutans, Penicillium chrysogenum\_\
    and\_Fusarium oxysporum.\_Ranking based on scores in: cost-effectiveness, leaf-health,\
    \ chlorophyll-intensity and general-health of seedlings revealed solarization\
    \ (35) as most effective technique for managing soil-borne pathogens, followed\
    \ by boiling (33), heating (31), untreated control (27) and lastly fumigation\
    \ (26). Identified pathogens induce aflatoxins in Citrus and lead to great losses\
    \ during post-harvest handling; they also cause root and fruit-rots. Solarization\
    \ creates solar-radiation in a miniature greenhouse that kills pathogens. There\
    \ is a need to study non-inorganic control practices of citrus pathogens under\
    \ field conditions for improved yields in Uganda."
