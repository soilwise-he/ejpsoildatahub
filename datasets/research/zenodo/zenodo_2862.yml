  title: Study of the efficiency of sweet potato growing in the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine
    by different methods of soil mulching
  abstract: "Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a new crop for soil and climatic\
    \ conditions of Ukraine, the active implementation of which is hindered by the\
    \ lack of recommendations on technological aspects of cultivation. One of the\
    \ important technological measures for growing sweet potatoes is the use of soil\
    \ mulching, which improves the water regime and regulates the thermal regime of\
    \ the soil; prevention of weed growth and growth of sweet potato shoots to the\
    \ soil. Thus, the aim of the research is to determine the efficiency of growing\
    \ sweet potatoes in the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine by different methods of soil\
    \ mulching.\n\n\nField research was carried out on typical low-humus light loamy\
    \ chernozem on loess loam.\n\n\nIt was noted, that when growing sweet potatoes\
    \ on ridges, the introduction of mulching the soil with black polyethylene film\
    \ provides more active growth of the vegetative mass throughout the growing season\
    \ (5.33\_shoots/plant with a total length of 252.1\_cm), while growing without\
    \ ridges has a positive effect on plants growth due to the general absence of\
    \ mulch (2.53\_shoots/plant with a total length of 107.8\_cm).\n\n\nThe use of\
    \ ridges and mulching the soil with black polyethylene film causes the yield of\
    \ sweet potato tubers at 34.8\_t/ha, while the mulching of the soil with straw,\
    \ the yield was 18.3\u201321.9\_t/ha, without mulching \u2013 13.0\u201317, 1\_\
    t/ha. Mulching with black polyethylene film ensures the accumulation of vitamin\
    \ C and starch in sweet potato tubers. When growing the culture on ridges by this\
    \ method of mulching, the maximum level of vitamin C according to the experiment\
    \ (4.78\_mg/100\_g) and starch (11.73\_%) was noted.\n\n\nThe introduction of\
    \ mulching and ridge formation involves additional material and labor costs, but\
    \ helps to reduce weed control and tuber digging costs. When growing sweet potatoes\
    \ on ridges with mulching with black polyethylene film, the minimum additional\
    \ labor costs for the formation of a unit of yield (1.95 man-minutes/kg of tubers)\
    \ were noted, while without mulching and without ridges this figure was 6.76 man-minute/kg"
