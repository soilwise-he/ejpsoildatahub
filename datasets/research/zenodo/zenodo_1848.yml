  title: Analyses of Some Engineering Properties of Ado-Ekiti to Ilawe-Ekiti Road
    Soil, Southwestern Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;This study sought to analyze the Engineering properties of Ado
    Ekiti to Ilawe Ekiti road soil. Soil samples were taken from three locations within
    the study area to laboratory for Atterberg Limits, Particle Size Distribution
    and Permeability tests. Results showed that the Liquid Limit LL , Plasticity Index
    PI , Shrinkage Limit SL and Permeability values varied from 28.48 to 32.50 , 12.03
    to 23.60 , 0.6 to 0.72 and 5.14 x 10 5&nbsp; to 1.08 x 10 3 mm s respectively
    for all the soil samples. Their clay or silt, sand and gravel also ranged from
    15.3 to 34.1 , 48.1 - 77.2 and 3.8 - 13.6 respectively. The soil samples were
    generally and grouply classified as granular and A 2 6 materials with mainly silty
    or clayey gravel and sand constituent materials. All the soil samples were good
    as subgrade, subbase and base materials. However, they have low permeability,
    which showed the reason for road failure in their locations. It is recommended
    that further study should be carried out. Samuel O. Akinlolu | Adeyemi E. Adetoro
