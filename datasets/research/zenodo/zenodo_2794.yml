  title: 'Impacts of the sowing delay on summer corn in a Mediterranean sandy soil:
    Biomass production, nutrients uptake and nutritive value'
  abstract: Corn is a major forage in intensive dairy systems. In northern Morocco,
    the production of summer corn after spring corn became a common practice. The
    aim of this study was to assess the impact of sowing delay on productivity, nutrient
    uptake, and forage quality of summer corn. An experiment was conducted during
    the summer of 2019. Four sowing dates (July 14, July 24, August 3, and August
    13) were tested in a randomized complete block design with five replications.
    All the sowing dates were supplied with the same amount of nutrients. At harvest,
    the sowing delay induced a significant decline in biomass production for August
    13 (-46%) compared to July 24. In addition, the highest stem height and stem diameter
    were recorded for the July 14 and July 24 sowing dates. The plant nutrients contents
    were similar for all the sowing dates. However, N, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn uptake
    were significantly affected by the sowing dates. The lowest amount of N, K, Mg,
    Fe, Mn, and Zn uptake were recorded for the August 13 sowing date. Late summer
    sown corn appeared to use N and K less efficiently than earlier summer corn. This
    study can help producers to determine the appropriate sowing window for summer
    silage corn in the southern Mediterranean region, especially in Loukkos region
    of Morocco.
