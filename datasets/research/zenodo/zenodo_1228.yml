  title: Apraisal Of Demolished Concrete Coarse And Fines For Stabilization Of Clayey
    Soil
  abstract: "Road pavements or structure on loose soil needs stabilization. Soil stabilization\
    \ is mainly done for modifying soil engineering properties to improve the bearing\
    \ capacity and durability property of weak soil. At the same time the waste material\
    \ disposal is possessing a lot of problem for disposal. The aim of the study is\
    \ to appraise the waste material with a review on stabilization of clayey soil\
    \ using demolished concrete structural fines. Various methods are available for\
    \ stabilizing clayey soil. These methods include stabilization with chemical additives,\
    \ soil replacement, compaction control, moisture control and thermal methods.\
    \ Based on literature reviews and use of demolished waste issues, fines obtained\
    \ from demolished waste is a low cost and effective soil stabilization method.\
    \ This dissertation presents the results of a study that investigated the use\
    \ of demolished concrete in the stabilization of expansive clayey soil.\n\n \n\
    \nThe demolished waste is crushed into fines and coarse materials and grading\
    \ of fines is done to know the properties of demolished fines and there suitability\
    \ as a stabilization material. The soil has been stabilized with 0.5%, 10% and\
    \ 25% of demolished concrete fines and coarse. The final mixtures were tested:\
    \ Moisture Content Atterberglimits, Compactionand California Bearing Ratio Unconfined\
    \ Triaxial test. Results indicates that demolished concrete content increases,\
    \ maximum dry density decrease while CBR values tend to increase. Thus, demolished\
    \ concrete could potentially act similar to lime or cement in improving the properties\
    \ of clayey soils. Finally it is concluded that the specific gravity increases\
    \ with increase in amount of stabilizer. Plasticity index of soil decrease with\
    \ increase in amount of stabilizer. The maximum dry density increases, and the\
    \ optimum moisture content decreases with increasing the concrete content in the\
    \ mixture.\n\n \n\nThe CBR values of the mixtures increases with increasing the\
    \ recycled concrete content in the mixture. Using C&amp;D waste in soil stabilization\
    \ helps to reduce the hazardous environmental impacts of the waste and improves\
    \ the engineering properties of soil which ultimately reduces the cost of construction\
    \ and increases the life of the structure built on stabilized soil."
