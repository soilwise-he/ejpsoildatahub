  title: Comparative analysis of soil organic carbon storage under different land
    use and land cover in Achanakmar, Chhattisgarh
  abstract: "In context to the India\u2019s climate pledge and the goal of limiting\
    \ global warming below 2\uF0B0C to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by\
    \ 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level and to create an additional carbon\
    \ sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and\
    \ tree cover by 2030. Forest vegetation and forest soils represent a significant\
    \ sink for atmospheric CO2, soil biota functioning, reduction of greenhouse gases,\
    \ modification of pollutants and maintenance of soil quality. The great importance\
    \ of carbon sequestration emphasizes the need to understand the role of soil carbon\
    \ dynamics and quantitative changes as affected by different land use pattern\
    \ and vegetation cover management. However, knowledge on the impact of different\
    \ land use and vegetation cover on soil carbon dynamics in India is very limited.\
    \ To address this problem the present study was undertaken in Achanakmar, Chhattisgarh\
    \ to estimate soil carbon sequestration potential of four land uses (forestland,\
    \ grassland, agricultural land and wasteland) and five land covers (sal, teak,\
    \ bamboo, mixed, open and scrub). The highest soil carbon storage potential was\
    \ found in forestland (118.14 t ha-1) followed by grassland (95.54 t ha-1), agricultural\
    \ land (75.70 t ha-1) and least was found in the wasteland (57.05 t ha-1). Among\
    \ the different land covers, maximum soil carbon storage potential was found in\
    \ the soils under mixed land cover (118.18 t ha-1) followed by teak (76.64 t ha-1),\
    \ bamboo (67.21 t ha-1), sal (64.28 t ha-1) and least under soils of open and\
    \ scrub (48.72 t ha-1) land cover.\n\n<strong><em>Journal of Biodiversity and\
    \ Environmental Sciences-JBES</em></strong> is an open-access scholarly research\
