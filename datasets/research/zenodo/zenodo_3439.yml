  title: Effects of Drought on Microbial Activity in Rhizosphere, Soil Hydrophobicity
    and Leaching of Mineral Nitrogen from Arable Soil Depending on Method of Fertilization
  abstract: 'This work presents the first results from the long-term laboratory experiment
    dealing with impact of drought on soil properties. Three groups of the treatment
    (A, B and C) with different regime of irrigation were prepared. The soil water
    content was maintained at 70 % of soil water holding capacity in group A, at 40
    % in group B. In group C, soil water regime was maintained in the range of wilting
    point. Each group of the experiment was divided into three variants (A1 = B1,
    C1; A2 = B2, C2 etc.) with three repetitions: Variants A1 (B1, C1) were controls
    without addition of another fertilizer. Variants A2 (B2, C2) were fertilized with
    mineral nitrogen fertilizer DAM 390 (0.140 Mg of N per ha) and variants A3 (B3,
    C3) contained 45 g of Cp per a pot. The significant differences (ANOVA, P&lt;0.05)
    in the leaching of mineral nitrogen and values of saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (Ksat) were found. The highest values of Ksat were found in variants (within each
    group) with addition of compost (A3, B3, C3). Conversely, the lowest values of
    Ksat were found in variants with addition of mineral nitrogen. Low values of Ksat
    indicate an increased level of hydrophobicity in individual groups of the experiment.
    Moreover, all variants with compost addition showed lower amount of mineral nitrogen
    leaching and high level of microbial activity than variants without. This decrease
    of mineral nitrogen leaching was about 200 % in comparison with the control variant
    and about 300 % with variant, where mineral nitrogen was added. Based on these
    results, we can conclude that changes of soil water content directly have impact
    on microbial activity, soil hydrophobicity and loss of mineral nitrogen from the
    soil.'
