  title: Bioremediation Of Phenanthrene By Monocultures And Mixed Culture Bacteria
    Isolated From Contaminated Soil
  abstract: Three different bacteria capable of degrading phenanthrene were isolated
    from hydrocarbon contaminated site. In this study, the phenanthrene-degrading
    activity by defined monoculture was determined and mixed culture was identified
    as <em>Acinetobacter</em> sp. P3d, <em>Bacillus </em>sp. P4a and <em>Pseudomonas</em>
    sp. P6. All bacteria were able to grow in a minimal salt medium saturated with
    phenanthrene as the sole source of carbon and energy. Phenanthrene degradation
    efficiencies by different combinations (consortia) of these bacteria were investigated
    and their phenanthrene degradation was evaluated by gas chromatography. Among
    the monocultures,<em> Pseudomonas</em> sp. P6 exhibited 58.71% activity compared
    to <em>Acinetobacter</em> sp. P3d and <em>Bacillus</em> sp. P4a which were 56.97%
    and 53.05%, respectively after 28 days of cultivation. All consortia showed high
    phenanthrene elimination which were 95.64, 79.37, 87.19, 79.21% for Consortia
    A, B, C and D, respectively. The results indicate that all of the bacteria isolated
    may effectively degrade target chemical and have a promising application in bioremediation
    of hydrocarbon contaminated soil purposes.
