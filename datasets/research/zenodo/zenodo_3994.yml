  title: PREDICTION OF SOIL EROSION RATES IN A SUGAR PALM AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM IN THE
    JOMPI WATERSHED, MUNA, INDONESIA
  abstract: A study of soil erosion rates in a sugar palm agroforestry system was
    conducted. The study was carried out in the Jompi watershed, Muna, Southeast Sulawesi,
    Indonesia, geographically located between 4049'53" - 4053'16" S and 122039'53'
    - 122040'5" E. The objective of the study was to predict the rates of soil erosion
    in a sugar palm agroforestry system in the Jompi watershed. Twelve purposively
    sampled land units were assessed and their erosion rates were predicted based
    on the USLE method. The weighted erosion rate in the Jompi watershed sugar palm
    agroforestry system was 62.18 tons ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>, which fell
    into category moderate of the erosion hazard index. The level of soil cover had
    a significant effect on erosion rate. The average erosion events on the three
    levels of soil cover (low, moderate, high), however, did not show any significant
    effect.
