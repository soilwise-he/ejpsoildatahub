    \ was to determine the effect of organic and bio fertilization to the growth performance\
    \ of corn planted on Rasau series soil. A factorial experiment of 5 x 2 Randomised\
    \ Complete Block Design replicated 4 times was conducted at the glasshouse of\
    \ Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. The factors include organic manure at 5 levels\
    \ OM1 (control), OM2 (chicken manure), OM3 (cattle manure), OM4 (horse manure)\
    \ and OM5 (biochar) and arbuscular mycorrhizal Fungi at 2 levels M1 (with) and\
    \ M2 (without), the variables measured were plant height, stem girth, leaf height,\
    \ leaf number, leaf length, leaf width and leaf area at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after\
    \ planting (WAP). The data collected were analysed using Analysis of Variance\
    \ (ANOVA) with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and means separated using Duncan\u2019\
    s Multiple Range Test at p&lt;0.05. The growth performance of the test crop (sweet\
    \ corn) in this experiment was significant in the measured parameters with chicken\
    \ manure (OM2) under mycorrhizal inoculation (M1). The result of this study showed\
    \ chicken manure when inoculated with AMF can boost sweet corn production on Rasau\
    \ series soil\n\n<strong><em>International Journal of Agronomy and Agricultural\
