  title: Influence Of Botanicals On Soil Fertility Potentials, Seed Germination And
    Performance Of Maize (Zea Mays) Varieties Under Low Fertile Continuously-Cropped
    Soil Conditions
  abstract: "It is not unreasonable to state that, even before the introduction of\
    \ organic agriculture, African local farmers have numerous of undocumented environment-friendly,\
    \ nature-inclined indigenous techniques for boosting soil fertility and enhancing\
    \ crop yield. However, despite the versatility of indigenous knowledge, setback\
    \ is always experienced from western science, which tags such knowledge as being\
    \ non-scientific and not worthy of scholarly engagements. A field experiment was\
    \ carried out in the year 2013, at the Teaching and Research Farms, Ladoke Akintola\
    \ University of Technology, Ogbomoso, to assess the soil fertility and yield promoting\
    \ potentials of some indigenous plant species\u2019 botanicals used as pre-planting\
    \ treatments on different maize varieties. It was a 3 by 5 factorial experiment.\
    \ The treatments introduced were: Three (3) maize varieties (V1 = ACR-DMR-SR-Y,\
    \ V2 = Local EM-W and V3 = Suwan Solo Yellow and five (5) other treatments (comprising\
    \ pre-sowing botanical treatments of: Kigelia africana only, Glyphea brevis only,\
    \ combination of Kigelia africana and Glyphea brevis only, NPK fertilizer application\
    \ (as a reference) and the control (treated with ordinary water only). The trial\
    \ was laid out in Split Plot in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), replicated\
    \ three times. Data were collected on growth and yield parameters, and the data\
    \ collected were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Means were compared\
    \ using Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). All the botanical treatments significantly\
    \ influenced germination, growth, yield and nutrient uptakes of maize, compared\
    \ to the control. Either of the botanicals tested (with ordinary basal manure\
    \ application of the pre-existing plant residues on the field), competed effectively\
    \ with NPK fertilized plants. Hence, since maize responded better to sole treatments\
    \ of either Kigelia africana or Glyphea brevis extracts, irrespective of varieties\
    \ than the combined treatment of the two botanicals, any of the maize varieties\
    \ is therefore recommended as being suitably compatible with either of the sole\
    \ botanical treatments, in the study area. Thus, this research is reasonable,\
    \ particularly in the aspects of fertilizer economy, environment-friendliness,\
    \ organic farming and more profitable crop production in the tropics, where soils\
    \ are continuously cropped and marginal."
