  title: FIELD TESTING OF PILES FOR HORIZONTAL LOAD, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SOAKING
    OF THE SOIL
  abstract: <strong>Abstract</strong> In recent years, the Orkhon-Selengsky region,
    especially the city of Darkhan, in whose territories loess-like subsiding soils
    are widespread, are actively being built and it is planned to build an ASG and
    imperial structures to regulate the problems of overpopulation and smoke in the
    city of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. In connection with these, the tasks
    of an experimental-theoretical study of the work of piles for various combinations
    of loads, taking into account the soaking of subsiding foundation soils, are acutely
    posed. This report discusses the results of field tests and numerical solutions
    of 2 bored piles with a length of 8.0 m and a diameter of 0.6 m for a horizontal
    load under conditions of preliminary soaking of subsiding soil in order to determine
    the values of the ultimate load and the magnitude of the horizontal displacement.
