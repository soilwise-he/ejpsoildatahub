    A study on the adsorption of fluoride was conducted using Zr-treated laterite
    soil as adsorbent. X-Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared
    Spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the treated laterite soil as adsorbent.
    Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to investigate the effect of different
    operating parameters namely, adsorbent dose, initial concentrations of fluoride
    and contact time on the uptake of fluoride from aqueous solution. A two level
    three factor (2<sup>3</sup> ) central composite design (CCD) was used for determining
    the optimum experimental conditions and interactions of process variables. The
    optimum adsorbent dose, initial concentrations of fluoride and contact time were
    found to be 2.93 g/L, 40 mg/L and 88.5 min respectively. Fluoride removal was
    96.32% at the optimum combination of process parameters. This adsorbent can hence
    be suggested as an appropriate material for the removal of fluoride.'
