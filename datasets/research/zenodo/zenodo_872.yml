  title: Rice Yield Responses in a Saline Soil in Sri Lanka
  abstract: This article 'Rice Yield Responses in a Saline Soil in Sri Lanka' appeared
    in the International Rice Research Newsletter series, created by the International
    Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication was
    to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development of improved
    technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems. This publication will
    report what scientists are doing to increase the production of rice in as much
    as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce nations in the world.
