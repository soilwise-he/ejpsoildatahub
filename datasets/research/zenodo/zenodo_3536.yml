  title: Prediction of Soil Liquefaction by Using  UBC3D-PLM Model in PLAXIS
  abstract: Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a
    soil is reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid cyclic loading. Liquefaction
    and related phenomena have been responsible for huge amounts of damage in historical
    earthquakes around the world. Modelling of soil behaviour is the main step in
    soil liquefaction prediction process. Nowadays, several constitutive models for
    sand have been presented. Nevertheless, only some of them can satisfy this mechanism.
    One of the most useful models in this term is UBCSAND model. In this research,
    the capability of this model is considered by using PLAXIS software. The real
    data of superstition hills earthquake 1987 in the Imperial Valley was used. The
    results of the simulation have shown resembling trend of the UBC3D-PLM model.
