  title: Experimental Simulation Of Soil Boundary Condition For Dynamic Studies
  abstract: This paper studies the free-field response by adopting a flexible membrane
    container as soil boundary for experimental shaking table tests. The influence
    of the soil container boundary on the soil behaviour and the dynamic soil properties
    under seismic effect were examined. A flexible container with 1/50 scale factor
    was adopted in the experimental tests, including construction, instrumentation,
    and determination of the results of dynamic tests on a shaking table. Horizontal
    face displacements and accelerations were analysed to determine the influence
    of the container boundary on the performance of the soil. The outputs results
    show that the flexible boundary container allows more displacement and larger
    accelerations. The soil in a rigid wall container cannot deform as similar as
    the soil in the real field does. Therefore, the response of flexible container
    tested is believed to be more reliable for soil boundary than that in the rigid
    container.
