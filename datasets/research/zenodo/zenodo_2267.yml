  title: Analysis and Modeling of Shear Stress Generated Over Wheel and Rim Material
    during Interaction with Soil
  abstract: <em>This paper represents the findings of its original paper where the
    center point between wheel and soil is used as a point of reference to study about
    the generated stress and other mechanical factors. Generally light weight vehicles
    are used for this study purpose. The traction force which is generated between
    wheels is responsible for further generation of shear stress. Sand can be studied
    in two types like dry sand and wet send. Other electronic components can be used
    to witness the performance of wheel and sand joining lines. Shear stress can be
    defined as ratio of parallel force to area. </em>
