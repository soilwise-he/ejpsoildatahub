  title: Metagenomic Analysis of Soil Bacterial Community and Level of Genes Responsible
    for Biodegradation of Aromatic Hydrocarbons
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The aim of the studies was to compare the composition of soil
    bacterial metabiomes originating from urbanized areas and areas con&shy;taminated
    with hydrocarbons with those from agricultural soil and forest soil obtained from
    a protected wild-life park area. It should be noted that hydrocarbons are everywhere
    therefore bacteria capable of their utilization are present in every soil type.
    In the hydrocarbon-contaminated soil and in the soil of anthropogenic origin,
    the bacteria belonging to Gammaproteobacteria were dominant (28.4&ndash;36.6%),
    whereas in the case of agricultural soil and protected wild-life park soil their
    ratios decreased (22.8&ndash;23.0%) and were similar to that of Alphaproteobacteria.
    No statistically significant changes were observed in terms of the Operational
    Taxonomic Unit identified in the studies soils, however, based on the determined
    alpha-diversity it can be established that contaminated soils were characterized
    by lower biodiversity indices compared to agricultural and forest soils. Furthermore,
    the dioxygenase level was also evaluated in the studied soils, which are genes
    encoding crucial enzymes for the decomposition of mono- and polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons during the biodegradation of diesel oil (PAHRHD&alpha;GN, PAHRHD&alpha;GP,
    xylE, Cat 2,3, ndoB). It was concluded that both the population structure of the
    soil metabiome and the number of genes crucial for biodegradation processes differed
    significantly between the soils. The level of analysed genes showed a similar
    trend, as their highest number in relations to genes encoding 16S RNA was determined
    in urban and hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.&lt;/p&gt;'
