  title: 'The Impact of Soil-Improving Cropping Practices on Erosion Rates: A Stakeholder-Oriented
    Field Experiment Assessment'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The risk of erosion is particularly high in Mediterranean areas,
    especially in areas that are subject to a not so effective agricultural management&ndash;or
    with some omissions&ndash;, land abandonment or wildfires. Soils on Crete are
    under imminent threat of desertification, characterized by loss of vegetation,
    water erosion, and subsequently, loss of soil. Several large-scale studies have
    estimated average soil erosion on the island between 6 and 8 Mg/ha/year, but more
    localized investigations assess soil losses one order of magnitude higher. An
    experiment initiated in 2017, under the framework of the SoilCare H2020 EU project,
    aimed to evaluate the effect of different management practices on the soil erosion.
    The experiment was set up in control versus treatment experimental design including
    different sets of treatments, targeting the most important cultivations on Crete
    (olive orchards, vineyards, fruit orchards). The minimum-to-no tillage practice
    was adopted as an erosion mitigation practice for the olive orchard study site,
    while for the vineyard site, the cover crop practice was used. For the fruit orchard
    field, the crop-type change procedure (orange to avocado) was used. The experiment
    demonstrated that soil-improving cropping techniques have an important impact
    on soil erosion, and as a result, on soil water conservation that is of primary
    importance, especially for the Mediterranean dry regions. The demonstration of
    the findings is of practical use to most stakeholders, especially those that live
    and work with the local land.&lt;/p&gt;'
