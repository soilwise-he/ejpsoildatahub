  title: International Union of Geological Sciences Manual of Standard Geochemical
    Methods for the Global Black Soil Project
  abstract: "<strong>Source web page:</strong> http://www.globalgeochemicalbaselines.eu/content/162/black-soil-project-manual-/\
    \ <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong> The aims of the International Union of Geological\
    \ Sciences <em>Commission on Global Geochemical Baselines</em> are: \u2022 To\
    \ provide high-quality geochemical baseline data for the terrestrial part of our\
    \ home planet Earth; \u2022 To establish a Geochemical Reference Network for levelling\
    \ data sets of existing regional geochemical projects, and \u2022 To provide reference\
    \ samples and sites for future monitoring of the chemical state of the World\u2019\
    s terrestrial surface. Hence, the generated geochemical data must be of high quality,\
    \ integrity and consistency. Sampling of Black Soil (chernozems), <em>sensu stricto</em>,\
    \ is not included in the programme of the International Union of Geological Sciences\
    \ (IUGS) Commission on Global Geochemical Baselines, because it is an agricultural\
    \ soil impacted by human activities. However, it is an important agricultural\
    \ soil, and as is considered to be among some of the most productive soil types\
    \ in the World, it should quite rightly be studied separately from other agricultural\
    \ soil types. The aim of the Global Black Soil Critical Zone Geo-ecological Survey\
    \ (BASGES) is to study, in a holistic approach, the serious degradation problems\
    \ that Black Soil types are facing all over the world because of several decades\
    \ of intensive cultivation. Their present chemical state shall be studied by following\
    \ the principles of the IUGS Commission on Global Geochemical Baselines for producing\
    \ an internally consistent high-quality geochemical database. The requirements\
    \ are to use standardised sampling and sample preparation methods, and all samples\
    \ must be analysed in the same laboratory for the same suite of determinands/parameters,\
    \ following a strict quality control protocol. The present manual contains comprehensive\
    \ instructions for sample site selection, sample collection and preparation, recommendations\
    \ for the preparation of project reference samples, laboratory analysis, quality\
    \ control procedures that should be implemented, checking the quality of analytical\
    \ data, required supporting information for interpretation of geochemical data,\
    \ and need for the establishment of site-specific guideline values for Black Soil\
    \ in the different regions of its occurrence. <strong>The URL of the pdf file\

    \ <strong>IUGS APPROVAL FOR PUBLICATION </strong> The Executive Committee of the\
    \ <em>International Union of Geological Sciences</em> approved the publication\
    \ of the \u201C<em>International Union of Geological Sciences Manual of Standard\
    \ Geochemical Methods for the Global Black Soil Project</em>\u201D at its 74<sup>th</sup>\
    \ meeting in Busan of South Korea on the 17<sup>th</sup> of January 2020. The\
    \ Executive Committee members Qiuming Cheng (President), Kristine Asch (Vice President),\
    \ William Cavazza (Vice President), Stanley C. Finney (Secretary-General), Hiroshi\
    \ Kitazato (Treasurer), Roland Oberh\xE4nsli (Past President), Ben Mapani (Councillor),\
    \ Edmund Nickless (Councillor), Silvia Peppoloni (Councillor) and Claudia Mora\
    \ (Councillor) are thanked for approving the publication of this manual. <strong>Supplementary\
    \ material</strong> For planning the sampling campaign of the Global Black Soil\
    \ regions, according to the specifications of the IUGS Commission on Global Geochemical\
    \ Baselines, the following files should be downloaded: Google Earth kml and kmz\
