  title: The Influence Of Using Compost Leachate On Soil Reaction
  abstract: 'In the area where the high quality water is not

    available, unconventional water sources are used to irrigate.

    Household leachate is one of the sources which are used in dry and

    semi dry areas in order to water the barer trees and plants. It meets

    the plants needs and also has some effects on the soil, but at the same

    time it might cause some problems as well. This study in order to

    evaluate the effect of using Compost leachate on the density of soil

    iron in form of a statistical pattern called ''''Split Plot'''' by using two

    main treatments, one subsidiary treatment and three repetitions of the

    pattern in a three month period. The main N treatments include:

    irrigation using well water as a blank treatments and the main I

    treatments include: irrigation using leachate and well water

    concurrently. Some subsidiary treatments were DI (Drop Irrigation)

    and SDI (Sub Drop Irrigation). Then in the established plots, 36

    biannual pine and cypress shrubs were randomly grown. Two months

    later the treatment begins. The results revealed that there was a

    significant variation between the main treatment and the instance

    regarding pH decline in the soil which was related to the amount of

    leachate injected into the soil. After some time and using leachate the

    pH level fell, as much as 0.46 and also increased due to the great

    amounts of leachate. The underneath drop irrigation ends in better

    results than sub drop irrigation since it keeps the soil texture fixed.'
