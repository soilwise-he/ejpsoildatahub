  title: 3D Finite Element Analysis For Mechanics Of Soil-Tool Interaction
  abstract: 'This paper is part of a study to develop robots for

    farming. As such power requirement to operate equipment attach to

    such robots become an important factor. Soil-tool interaction plays

    major role in power consumption, thus predicting accurately the

    forces which act on the blade during the farming is very important for

    optimal designing of farm equipment. In this paper, a finite element

    investigation for tillage tools and soil interaction is described by

    using an inelastic constitutive material law for agriculture

    application. A 3-dimensional (3D) nonlinear finite element analysis

    (FEA) is developed to examine behavior of a blade with different

    rake angles moving in a block of soil, and to estimate the blade force.

    The soil model considered is an elastic-plastic with non-associated

    Drucker-Prager material model. Special use of contact elements are

    employed to consider connection between soil-blade and soil-soil

    surfaces. The FEA results are compared with experimental ones,

    which show good agreement in accurately predicting draft forces

    developed on the blade when it moves through the soil. Also a very

    good correlation was obtained between FEA results and analytical

    results from classical soil mechanics theories for straight blades.

    These comparisons verified the FEA model developed. For analyzing

    complicated soil-tool interactions and for optimum design of blades,

    this method will be useful.'
