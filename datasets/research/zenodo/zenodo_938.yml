  title: Protective Role of Native Rhizospheric Soil Microbiota Against the Exposure
    to Microcystins Introduced into Soil-Plant System via Contaminated Irrigation
    Water and Health Risk Assessment
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Microcystins (MCs) produced in eutrophic waters may decrease
    crop yield, enter food chains and threaten human and animal health. The main objective
    of this research was to highlight the role of rhizospheric soil microbiota to
    protect faba bean plants from MCs toxicity after chronic exposure. Faba bean seedlings
    were grown in pots containing agricultural soil, during 1 month under natural
    environmental conditions of Marrakech city in Morocco (March&ndash;April 2018)
    and exposed to cyanobacterial extracts containing up to 2.5 mg&middot;L&minus;1
    of total MCs. Three independent exposure experiments were performed (a) agricultural
    soil was maintained intact &ldquo;exposure experiment 1&rdquo;; (b) agricultural
    soil was sterilized &ldquo;exposure experiment 2&rdquo;; (c) agricultural soil
    was sterilized and inoculated with the rhizobia strain Rhizobium leguminosarum
    RhOF34 &ldquo;exposure experiment 3&rdquo;. Overall, data showed evidence of an
    increased sensitivity of faba bean plants, grown in sterilized soil, to MCs in
    comparison to those grown in intact and inoculated soils. The study revealed the
    growth inhibition of plant shoots in both exposure experiments 2 and 3 when treated
    with 2.5 mg&middot;L&minus;1 of MCs. The results also showed that the estimated
    daily intake (EDI) of MCs, in sterilized soil, exceeded 2.18 and 1.16 times the
    reference concentrations (0.04 and 0.45 &micro;g of microcysin-leucine arginine
    (MC-LR). Kg&minus;1 DW) established for humans and cattle respectively, which
    raises concerns about human food chain contamination.&lt;/p&gt;'
