  title: Carbon and nitrogen fixation differ between successional stages of biological
    soil crusts in the Colorado Plateau and Chihuahuan Desert
  abstract: "Biological soil crusts (cyanobacteria, mosses and lichens collectively)\
    \ perform essential ecosystem services, including carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)\
    \ fixation. Climate and land-use change are converting later successional soil\
    \ crusts to early successional soil crusts with lower C and N fixation rates.\
    \ To quantify the effect of such conversions on C and N dynamics in desert ecosystems\
    \ we seasonally measured diurnal fixation rates in different biological soil crusts.\
    \ We classified plots on the Colorado Plateau (Canyonlands) and Chihuahuan Desert\
    \ (Jornada) as early (Microcoleus) or later successional (Nostoc/Scytonema or\
    \ Placidium/Collema) and measured photosynthesis (Pn), nitrogenase activity (NA),\
    \ and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) on metabolically active (moist) soil crusts.\
    \ Later successional crusts typically had greater Pn, averaging 1.2\u20131.3-fold\
    \ higher daily C fixation in Canyonlands and 2.4\u20132.8-fold higher in the Jornada.\
    \ Later successional crusts also had greater NA, averaging 1.3\u20137.5-fold higher\
    \ daily N fixation in Canyonlands and 1.3\u201325.0-fold higher in the Jornada.\
    \ Mean daily Fv/Fm was also greater in later successional Canyonlands crusts during\
    \ winter, and Jornada crusts during all seasons except summer. Together these\
    \ findings indicate conversion of soil crusts back to early successional stages\
    \ results in large reductions of C and N inputs into these ecosystems."
