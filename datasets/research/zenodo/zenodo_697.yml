  title: Management Strategies for Soil Compaction in Mechanized Sugarcane Cultivation
  abstract: "<em>A field survey was carried out at Cuddalore and Villupuram districts\
    \ of Tamil Nadu State to assess the impact of continues mechanisation in sugarcane\
    \ cultivation on soil physical propertiesduring 2016 -17. Soil samples were taken\
    \ at different depths viz.,0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm\u2019s from mechanized sugarcane\
    \ harvested fields as well as nearby non mechanised fields as control. The results\
    \ showed that an increased bulk density, hydraulic conductivity and infiltration\
    \ ratein mechanized cultivation field soils particularly at deeper depths (20\
    \ \u2013 40 cm) and (40 \u2013 60 cm) implying mechanization induced soil compaction.\
    \ To develop a suitable management strategy, field experiments were conducted\
    \ at Sugarcane Research Station, Cuddalore during 2017-20 in a field where mechanized\
    \ sugarcane cultivation was followed continuously for four years in a non -saline\
    \ neutral sandy loam (0-15cm) andclay (15 \u2013 60 cm) soil with the sugarcane\
    \ variety CoC 25 under strip plot design in three replications. The main plot\
    \ treatments of chisel plough, double disc plough and conventional ploughing in\
    \ combination with the sub plot treatments of farm yard manure, composted coirpith,\
    \ pressmud, green manure and composted sugarcane trash incorporation.</em>"
