  title: Comparative Study of Different Sewage Farming on Soil Quality
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Sewage Sludge contains high amount of nutrients in the form
    of wastewater. These wastewater are treated in Sewage treatment plant and separation
    of Sludge from wastewater is taken out using various type of technology. The sludge
    separated from wastewater are further treated in sludge treatment unit and removal
    of maximum amount of water are done using various equipment. The treated water
    is reused for various purposes or discharge into river bodies and the sludge after
    treatment are send to disposal site. This study focuses on the utilization of
    these sewage sludge as a fertilizer and comparison of this sludge with chemical
    fertilizer. The content of nutrient in sewage shows significant results on application
    with various plants and discussed the effect of sewage farming on soil quality.
