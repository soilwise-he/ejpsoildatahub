  title: 'Influential Parameters In Estimating Soil Properties From Cone Penetrating
    Test: An Artificial Neural Network Study'
  abstract: "The Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is a common in-situ<br>\ntest which generally\
    \ investigates a much greater volume of soil more<br>\nquickly than possible from\
    \ sampling and laboratory tests. Therefore,<br>\nit has the potential to realize\
    \ both cost savings and assessment of soil<br>\nproperties rapidly and continuously.\
    \ The principle objective of this<br>\npaper is to demonstrate the feasibility\
    \ and efficiency of using<br>\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the\
    \ soil angle of internal<br>\nfriction (\u03A6) and the soil modulus of elasticity\
    \ (E) from CPT results<br>\nconsidering the uncertainties and non-linearities\
    \ of the soil. In<br>\naddition, ANNs are used to study the influence of different<br>\n\
    parameters and recommend which parameters should be included as<br>\ninput parameters\
    \ to improve the prediction. Neural networks discover<br>\nrelationships in the\
    \ input data sets through the iterative presentation<br>\nof the data and intrinsic\
    \ mapping characteristics of neural topologies.<br>\nGeneral Regression Neural\
    \ Network (GRNN) is one of the powerful<br>\nneural network architectures which\
    \ is utilized in this study. A large<br>\namount of field and experimental data\
    \ including CPT results, plate<br>\nload tests, direct shear box, grain size distribution\
    \ and calculated data<br>\nof overburden pressure was obtained from a large project\
    \ in the<br>\nUnited Arab Emirates. This data was used for the training and the<br>\n\
    validation of the neural network. A comparison was made between<br>\nthe obtained\
    \ results from the ANN's approach, and some common<br>\ntraditional correlations\
    \ that predict \u03A6 and E from CPT results with<br>\nrespect to the actual results\
    \ of the collected data. The results show<br>\nthat the ANN is a very powerful\
    \ tool. Very good agreement was<br>\nobtained between estimated results from ANN\
    \ and actual measured<br>\nresults with comparison to other correlations available\
    \ in the<br>\nliterature. The study recommends some easily available parameters<br>\n\
    that should be included in the estimation of the soil properties to<br>\nimprove\
    \ the prediction models. It is shown that the use of friction<br>\nration in the\
    \ estimation of \u03A6 and the use of fines content in the<br>\nestimation of\
    \ E considerable improve the prediction models."
