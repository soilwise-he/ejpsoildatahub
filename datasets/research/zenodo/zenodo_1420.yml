  title: 'Influence of displacement piles on surrounding soil and nearby piles: a
    case study'
  abstract: For a large construction project in the greater Zug area (Switzerland),
    four maintained load axial pile loading test were<br> performed on 600 und 700
    mm diameter, 45 m long full displacement piles. The maximum test load was around<br>
    7800 kN. All test pile rebar cages were fitted with fiber-optic distributed sensing
    temperature and strain sensors,<br> allowing thermal integrity profiling of the
    test piles and the measurement of residual load. Because of the large pile<br>
    diameter and nearby sensitive infrastructure, pile installation was accompanied
    by a comprehensive monitoring of free<br> field soil displacement and heave. Pile
    installation monitoring comprised ten purpose built push in soil extensometers<br>
    to measure vertical soil heave at various depths, total station measurements and
    precision levelling for measuring<br> surface displacement and heave, and measurement
    of excess pore water pressures during installation. The results of<br> heave and
    lateral displacements are accordingly calculated by Cavity Expansion (CE) and
    Shallow Strain Path Method<br> (SSPM) and modifying factors are recommended to
    improve predictions with SSPM that can take into account soil<br> compressibility
    for non-homogeneous, layered soils.
