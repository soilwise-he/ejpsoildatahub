  title: SOIL FERTILITY CAPABILITY CLASSIFICATION (FCC) IN THE MEKONG DELTA, VIETNAMBASED
    ON THE CONVERSION OF SOIL MAP (WRB)
  abstract: The study was conducted to determine the spatial distribution of soil
    fertility capability types and its constraints for agricultural in the Mekong
    Delta, Vietnam. The study used soil map, soil chemical and physical data as the
    basis for developing the keys of the relationship to convert soil map classified
    by WRB system to soil fertility map classified by the FCC system. Soil constraints
    for agricultural cultivation from soil fertility classification were identified.
    The research results show that Mekong Delta has thirty-five (35) FCC soil fertility
    types. The thirteen (13)soil fertility constraints and recommendation for agricultural
    production were also identified, such as slightly acid (<strong>a</strong><sup>-</sup>),
    strongly acid (<strong>a</strong>), high P fixation and high Fe toxicity potential
    (<strong>i</strong>), low available P (<strong>p</strong>), strongly actual acid
    sulphate soils (<strong>c</strong>), slightly actual acid sulphate soils (<strong>c</strong><sup>-</sup>),
    shallow potential acid sulphate soil (<strong>f</strong>) deep potential acid
    sulphate soil (<strong>f</strong><sup>-</sup>), slight salinity (<strong>s</strong><sup>-</sup>),
    strongly salinity (<strong>s</strong>), ability low supply mineral (<strong>k</strong>),
    ability low nutrient retention (<strong>e</strong>), low organic carbon content
    (<strong>o</strong>).
