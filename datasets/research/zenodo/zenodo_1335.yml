  title: Impact of Stone Mine Waste on Sub Grade Characteristics of Expansive Soil
  abstract: Today, India is running on the way of development, thus the rapid growth
    of industrialization is increasing which creates scarcity of land for disposal
    of their industrial wastes. Hence, the urgent demand for utilization of such types
    of waste is coming out. From the civil engineering point of view, the kota stone
    dust, marble dust, rice husk, fly ash, blast furnace slag, foundry sand, glass
    waste, tiles waste, ceramics waste etc are the commonly waste which are used as
    a construction materials with replacement of conventional materials successfully
    and also having effective characteristics required by a good soil stabilization
    admixture. The current research shows the effective utilization of kota stone
    dust in the improvement of sub grade characteristics of black cotton soil. A number
    of tests were conducted in laboratory which shows that the kota stone slurry dust
    is a good alternative for the improvement of sub grade characteristics of black
    cotton soil. The Standard compaction test were conducted in laboratory for obtaining
    the maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum water content (OMC) corresponding to
    3% to 24% of kota stone slurry dust mixed with black cotton soil in the variation
    of 3% each. After the determination of OMC and MDD of different proportion, the
    laboratory California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were conducted with the above
    proportion of kota stone slurry dust and it was concluded that soaked CBR value
    of black cotton soil blended with 18% kota stone dust increased from 2.12 to 8.37
    i.e. 295%.
