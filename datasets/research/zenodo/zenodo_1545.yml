  title: The Effect of N Fertilizer Application Timing on Wheat Yield on Chernozem
    Soil
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;The challenges of the global food supply and environment conservation
    require ongoing scientific observations of soil-to-plant and plant-to-environment
    interactions with the aim of improving agriculture resource management. This study
    included observations of winter wheat yield and biomass of four varieties over
    three consecutive growing seasons and four site-year cases to assess the effects
    of nitrogen (N) fertilization rate and time of application on grain yield and
    biomass. For different wheat varieties, the full factorial design was performed,
    where factorial combinations of year, location, fall and spring N applications
    were laid out in a randomized complete block design. The N rate significantly
    influenced grain yield and biomass production efficiency. The time of N application
    had a highly significant effect on grain yield, biomass and NUE traits. The N
    rate of 120 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;was recognized as a breakpoint
    over which the grain yield and biomass showed a downtrend. N application in the
    fall had a significantly higher impact on grain yield and biomass compared to
    spring N application. The major contribution of wheat variability production belongs
    to seasonal climate circumstances (&lt;85%) and consequential intrinsic soil properties.
    The average difference of grain yield between varieties was 15.75%, and 12% of
    biomass, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;'
