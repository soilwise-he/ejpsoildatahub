  title: Effect of Prolonged Exposure to Generator Fumes on Selected Soil Microbial
    Enzymes
  abstract: "<strong>This study therefore sought to evaluate the effect of prolonged\
    \ exposure to generator fumes on selected soil microbial enzymes. Soil samples\
    \ used for this study were collected from different locations in Federal University\
    \ of Technology Owerri (FUTO) in Ihiagwa/North-West local government area of Imo\
    \ State, Nigeria. The selected areas for this investigation were areas with high\
    \ traffic and business activities. These areas were busy within the hours of 8.00\
    \ am \u2013 5.30 pm at the close of work and business activities. Four sample\
    \ points were chosen in each of the locations in order to capture concentration\
    \ of pollutants within that location. The soil sample used for enzyme identification\
    \ was stored in polyethylene plastic bags at a temperature below 15 <sup>o</sup>C\
    \ to avoid the loss of moisture, inhibition of microbial activities and enzymatic\
    \ reactions. Activities of soil microbial enzymes were assayed using standard\
    \ methods. The results of this study showed increased activities of the soil microbial\
    \ enzymes following exposure to generator fumes when compared with those from\
    \ the control site. Overall, increases in soil microbial enzyme activities were\
    \ indications of the corresponding impact of pollutants on the soil ecosystems.</strong>"
