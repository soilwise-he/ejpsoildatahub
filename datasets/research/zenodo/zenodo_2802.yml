  title: Spectrophotometric determination of mercury(II) in environmental (water,
    soil and biological) samples using 3-methylthiophene-2-carbaxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone
    (3-MTAT)
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur-515\

    \ <em>Manuscript received 01 February 2010, revised 10 August 2010, accepted 18\
    \ August 2010</em> Analytical applications of 3-methyllhiophene-:2-carbaxaldehyde\
    \ thiosemicarbazone (3-MTAT) are reported for the first time. The reagent has\
    \ been synthesized and characterized using IR, NMR and Mass spectral data. 3-MTAT\
    \ have been used for the spectrophotometric determination of mercury(ll). The\
    \ reagent reacts with mercury(ll) in basic medium (pH 8.0, ammonium chloride and\
    \ ammonium buffer) to form yellow colored 1: :2 (M : L) complex. The color reaction\
    \ is instantaneous and absorbance values remain constant for l:Z h. The molar\
    \ absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity of 3-MTAT method are found to be 1.87\
    \ x 10<sup>4</sup> L mol<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0107 \u03BCg cm<sup>-2</sup>\
    \ of mercury(ll) respectively. The method Is successfully applied to a number\
    \ of water (potable and polluted), biological and soil samples containing mercury(II).\
    \ The results of the proposed method in the analysis of samples are comparable\
    \ with those obtained by dithizone method. The method bas high accuracy and precision\
    \ (s = 0.0042 for 4 \u03BCg/ml in 3-MTAT method)."
