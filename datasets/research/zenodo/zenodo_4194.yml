  title: 'Geotechnical properties of clay soil in Mouyondzi in Congo treated at cement
    and fine fractions of lateritic to improve the performances of blocs of earth:
    An approach based on the multi-criteria assessing'
  abstract: "Abstract The acceleration of climate change and the continuous increase\
    \ in the world's population require technical improvements in earth building.\
    \ Thus, the local treatment of soils necessary for earthen construction is of\
    \ great importance. This paper presents the partial results on the assessment\
    \ of the geotechnical properties of Mouyondzi clay soils, treated at 2%, 3%, 4%,\
    \ 5% of cement content; then 10%, 20%, 30% of fine lateritic fraction to confection\
    \ the improved earthen blocks. The effect of these additions of cement and fine\
    \ lateritic fraction consists in enhances the durability of earthen buildings\
    \ during the exploitation. The multi-criteria evaluation method proposed and based\
    \ on measured geotechnical parameters (granulometry, Atterberg Limits, Compressibility\
    \ index\u2026) allowed analyzing all the possibilities of material selection.\
    \ The first results obtained show that the studied mixtures of soil have the accepted\
    \ properties to manufacture different type of earth blocks (Adobe, BTC)."
