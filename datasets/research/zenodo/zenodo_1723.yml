  title: Spectrophotometric determination of mercury(II) in water, soil and biological
    samples using heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones
  abstract: "Department of Chemistry, Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur-515\
    \ 003, Andhra Pradesh, India <em>E-mail</em> : khussainreddy@yahoo.co.in <em>Manuscript\
    \ received 17 June 2008, revised 23 October 2008, accepted 23 October 2008</em>\
    \ Analytical applications of 2-acetylpyridine-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (APMT)\
    \ and 2-acetylfuran thlosemi-carbazone (AFT) are reported for the first time.\
    \ The reagents have been synthesized and characterized using IR and NMR spectral\
    \ data. APMT and AFT have been used for the spectrophotometric determination of\
    \ mercury(II). The reagents give yellow colour with mercury(n) in sodium acetate-acetic\
    \ acids buffers. Many cations and anions do not Interfere In the determination\
    \ of mercury. The methods were successfully applied to a number of water (potable\
    \ and polluted), biological and soil samples containing mercury(II). The results\
    \ of the proposed method in the analysis of samples are comparable with those\
    \ obtained by dithizone method. The methods have high precision and accuracy (<em>s</em>\
    \ = 0.007 and 0.018 for 4 \xB5g/mL in APMT and AFT methods respectively)."
