  title: "Description of soil impurity for Elbasan city \u2013 Albania"
  abstract: This scientific paper enables us to present the bacteriological, physico-chemical
    parameters and heavy metals present in the soil of Elbasan city. Through this
    study we have obtained significant data that give us the opportunity to judge
    about soil impurity of Elbasan city, allowing us to present a current assessment
    of soil pollution. The pollution of the land of a historical-cultural city like
    Elbasan takes on a considerable importance in terms of the impact on the health
    of citizens, based mainly on the cultivation of agricultural crops in the study
    area. In view of this goal, during the September-October 2020 period, some soil
    samples were taken and analyzed in the laboratory, where the area predetermined
    by us for samples taking consists of the geographical space where the heavy industries
    of Elbasan city operate. All bacteriological, physico-chemical parameters and
    heavy metals part of the soil of Elbasan are presented for the first time in this
    paper. As a result of the results obtained where we encounter a significant soil
    pollution of Elbasani town we think that is attributed to the fact that Elbasan
    has always been considered as one of the most polluted cities in Albania in recent
    years. Finally, we can say that land pollution comes as a result of productive
    activities of light and heavy industries, which operate without implementing the
    rules of environmental protection in Albania but also from human activity mainly
    in agriculture, where we mention the use without criteria of pesticides and chemical
    fertilizers.
