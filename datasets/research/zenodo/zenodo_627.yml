  title: Assessment Of Biological Availability Of Radionuclides In The Soil
  abstract: "This article presents the results of the assessment of the biological\
    \ availability of radionuclides in the soil. The object of this work is to identify\
    \ the forms of cesium-137 in the soil and to establishing their quantitative ratio\
    \ 30 years after the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. We were determined\
    \ the mobility of radiocaesium in the soil, a sequential extraction method was\
    \ used. Research methods: Research revealed significant differences in the concentration\
    \ of radiocaesium in the solvents used. The content of radiocaesium in the aqueous\
    \ extract varied from 0.4 Bq to 5.5 Bq, ammonium acetate varied from 0.3 Bq to\
    \ 2.8 Bq. The most significant radiocaesium transitions were observed using hydrochloric\
    \ acid. When we were using 1M hydrochloric acid, radiocaesium content was (0.4\u2013\
    4.2) Bq, at a concentration of 6M (2\u201388) Bq. Analysis of the dynamics of\
    \ the content of radiocaesium in the aqueous extract indicates a decrease in the\
    \ size of the radionuclide transition overall soils. \u0410verage rates for sandy\
    \ loam were 2,3% and 1.8%, sandy soil 4.3% and 2.2%, and peat bog 0.8% and 0.3%\
    \ for 2017\u20132018 years. For the ammonium acetate extract on sandy loops, there\
    \ was an increase in the transition from 1.3% to 2.5%. On sand and peat, there\
    \ was a decrease in availability, respectively (7.6\u20134.5)% and (1.8\u2013\
    0.7)%. The radionuclide transition decreased from 2.9% to 2.2%, when extracting\
    \ with hydrochloric acid (1M concentration) on sandy loam. On the sand revealed\
    \ an increase in availability from 4.4% to 5.2%. Accessibility changes have occurred\
    \ minimal, on the moor. Soil treatment with 6M hydrochloric acid increased the\
    \ radionuclide transfer to sandy loam and peatlands. An increase in the amount\
    \ of radiocaesium in 6=M acid means the further fixation of the radionuclide by\
    \ the soil absorbing complex."
