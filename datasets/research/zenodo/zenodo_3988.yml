  title: Antibacterial Activity of Actinomycetes Isolated from a Few Selected Soil
    Samples of Southern Region of Western Ghats
  abstract: <em>Soil, actinomycetes plays an important role in pharmaceutical industries
    because they produce valuable natural antibiotics to treat chronic diseases in
    humans. In the present study, the actinomycetes were isolated from four different
    sample sites of Western Ghats. Totally twelve isolates were selected and screened
    for antibiotic activity using coliforms. Among the twelve isolates, two were found
    to effective against coliforms and these isolates were obtained from soil of Courtallum.
    Antibiotic sensitivity of the twelve isolates revealed varying performance. The
    two actinomycetes isolates of Courtallum have a potential to be included in researches
    of new preparations with characterization of the bioactive compounds.</em>
