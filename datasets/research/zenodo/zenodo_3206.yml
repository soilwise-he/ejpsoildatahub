  title: Effects of Kinetin, Coconut Milk and Calcium Chloride on Biochemical Indices
    of Boro Rice (Oryza Sativa L.) in Presence of Higher Manganese Condition of Acid
    Soil
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> In North-east India\
    \ including Assam, available Manganese [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] in soil is 3- 52 ppm\
    \ with a critical limit 2-3 ppm. In plants, [Mn<sup>2+</sup>] is 15-20 ppm g<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ dry weight, in excess of which Mn becomes toxic to crop plants (Basumatary et\
    \ al., 2014). There is a paucity of information on the effects of natural or synthetic\
    \ plant growth regulating subnstances viz., Cytokinin, Coconut milk and Calcium\
    \ chloride on amelioration of Mn toxicity of rice crop grown in acid soil condition\
    \ of Assam<strong>.</strong> So, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate\
    \ into the effects of root-dip treatments of rice crop with these substances on\
    \ biochemical performance of four rice genotypes (Kanaklata, Bishnuprasad, Jyotiprasad\
    \ and Numoli) cultivated in acid soil enriched with higher Mn (30ppm native Mn\
    \ plus 20ppm added Mn). At 20 ppm Mn application, there were decreases in total\
    \ chlorophyll content (14.52%), NR activity (17.77%), Carbohydrate content (3.83%).\
    \ In contrast, soil treated with 20 ppm Mn as basal at vegetative stage along\
    \ with the overnight (\u224812h) root dip treatments (RDT) of rice varieties with\
    \ Cytokinin (100ppm), Coconut milk (10 times dilution) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (100ppm),\
    \ enhenced Cholorophyll a (3-525-19.771%), Chlorophyll b (1.917-19.55%), total\
    \ chlorophyll contents (4.13-6.35%),) in leaf, NR activity (4.46-10.08%) and carbohydrate\
    \ content in grain (2.24-10.92%). The variety, Kanaklata was found to be the best\
    \ based on the biochemical parameters (total Chl:1.861 mg g<sup>-1</sup> f.w,\
    \ Chl \u2018a\u2019 (0.924 mg g-1 f.w), Chl \u2018b\u2019 (0.933 mg g-1 f.w),\
    \ Carbohydrate: 9.202 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in roots (59.35ppm)."
