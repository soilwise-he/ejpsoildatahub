  title: Phenotypic evaluation of rice germplasm and correlation studies of traits
    associated with tolerance to low soil phosphorus
  abstract: Phosphorus (P) is an essential macro-nutrient required for growth and
    development of all crop plants including rice. Low availability of P in the soils
    manifests in terms of impeding crop growth leading to yield losses in rice. Adequate
    genetic variability for low soil P tolerance and also P use efficiency has been
    documented in rice. In the present study, a set of 300 rice genotypes were screened
    for low soil phosphorous stress at low phosphorous (P) plot, ICAR-IIRR, Hyderabad,
    India. Phenotyping of various root and yield traits have been undertaken in both
    control and stressed plots. ANOVA analysis highlighted that there is a significant
    difference among the genotypes for all the traits under low P condition and control
    except for total number of tillers, which is non-significant in control. Pearson
    correlation analysis showed that grain yield per plant is highly correlated with
    root dry weight, root fresh weight, shoot dry weight, shoot fresh weight, root
    volume, root length, shoot length, panicle length, test weight, number of filled
    grains, total number of tillers and number of productive tillers and showing negatively
    correlated with number of unfilled grains and days to fifty percent flowering
    under phosphorous deficiency. Traits like Plant height, Panicle length, total
    number of tillers and number of productive tillers are significantly positively
    associated with grain yield per plant in adequate soil phosphorous condition but
    days to 50% flowering is in negative association with grain yield per plant. In
    control condition, genotypes like IIRR-16-46,16-80 and IIRR-16-350 possess higher
    yield whereas genotypes IIRR-16-206,16-91 and IIRR-16-134 showing higher yield
    under low P stress. The genotypes IIRR-16-349, IIRR-16-302 and F6 MSAC 4-7 are
    the three genotypes performed well in both control and low P conditions. The correlated
    traits help in identification of low soil phosphorus tolerant lines and helps
    in indirect selection. Identification of these genotypes performing well in both
    control and stressed scenarious helps in further utilisation for breeding of low
    P tolerance/efficient varieties.
