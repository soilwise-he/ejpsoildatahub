  title: Effects of Oilfield Water Treated by Electroflocculation and Reverse Osmosis
    in a Typical Brazilian Semiarid Soil
  abstract: Produced water (PW), which is water extracted along with oil, is the largest
    waste stream in the oil and gas industry. With the proper treatment, this wastewater
    can be used in agricultural irrigation. This study evaluated the effects the application
    of PW treated by electroflocculation (EF) and combined electroflocculation-reverse
    osmosis (EF-RO) on soil salinity and sodification parameters. Excessive sodium
    levels in PW treated by EF may affect soil structural stability and plant growth,
    and tends to accumulate in upper layers, displacing the nutrient K to deeper layers
    of the soil profile. PW treated by EF-RO did not promote salinization and soil
    sodification, indicating that this combined technique may be a viable alternative
    for oily water treatment aiming at irrigation use in semiarid regions.
