  title: The biological process activization in soil under Clematis as the basis of
    its fertility increasing
  abstract: The results of the effect of non-humificated organic matter on biological
    activity of soil under clematis are presented. It has been shown that application
    as green-manure marigold, calendula, beans after 6 and 24 months, increases the
    number of microorga nisms belonging to the main ecological-trophic and taxonomic
    groups. Noticeable increasing of humus contents, decreasing of soil acidity, iron
    and manganese has been established. This testifies that soil structure has improved
    and soil-sickness has eliminated.
