  title: Towards revealing the global diversity and community assembly of soil eukaryotes
  abstract: "Soil fungi, protists, and animals (i.e., the eukaryome) play a critical\
    \ role in key ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, we lack a holistic\
    \ understanding of the processes shaping the global distribution of the eukaryome.\
    \ We conducted a molecular analysis of 193 composite soil samples spanning the\
    \ world\u2019s major biomes. Our analysis showed that the importance of selection\
    \ processes was higher in the community assemblage of smaller-bodied and wider\
    \ niche breadth organisms. Soil pH and mean annual precipitation were the primary\
    \ determinants of the community structure of eukaryotic microbes and animals,\
    \ respectively. We further found contrasting latitudinal diversity patterns and\
    \ strengths for soil eukaryotic microbes and animals. Our results point to a potential\
    \ link between body size and niche breadth of soil eukaryotes and the relative\
    \ effect of ecological processes and environmental factors in driving their biogeographic\
    \ patterns."
