  title: Influence of Environmental Variables on Carbon Mineralization in Diverse
    Soil Management Systems Under Maize Cropping in Kwara State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Understanding the influence of agricultural soil management practices\
    \ on soil processes and the environment is vital for sustainable food production.\
    \ Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of soil temperature and moisture\
    \ on soil organic carbon mineralisation under synthetic (NPK) and organic (biochar)\
    \ amendments in a maize cropping system in Ilorin, Southern Guinea Savanna of\
    \ Nigeria. The objectives were to determine the C mineralisation and C sequestering\
    \ potential under each amendment and assess how precipitation amounts and soil\
    \ temperature influence carbon mineralisation. Two soil types (Anthrodensic Ustorthent\
    \ and Typic Ustorthent) were used, and four treatments (control, NPK, biochar+NPK,\
    \ and biochar) replicated thrice were laid out in completely randomised design\
    \ on each soil. Soil respiration was measured in-situ by the alkali absorption\
    \ method. Data collected was subjected to analysis of variance procedure for complete\
    \ randomized design to determine significant differences in treatment means, correlation\
    \ and regression analyses were also carried out to test the relationships amongst\
    \ experimental factors and variable responses. Results showed that evaluated nutrient\
    \ management options did not significantly influence C mineralisation. C mineralisation,\
    \ however, differed between soils, with Typic Ustorthent having higher organic\
    \ carbon (OC), total CO2 emission (82.35 mg) and mean CO2 emission rates (1.18\
    \ mg m -2 d -1 ). Correlation analysis showed differing relationships between\
    \ soil temperature and C mineralisation under the different treatments and soils,\
    \ with significant positive correlation (r=0.44; p= \u2264 0.05) recorded only\
    \ under sole biochar treatment in the Typic Ustorthent. Rainfall amounts had no\
    \ significant correlation with C mineralisation"
