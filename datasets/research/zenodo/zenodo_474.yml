  title: Road And Soil Dynamic Characterization From Surface Measurements
  abstract: "The increased demand for non-destructive evaluation of the shear wave\
    \ profiling, condition<br>\nmonitoring and performance assessment of soils and\
    \ roads in a dynamic state has made seismic<br>\nmethods the most desirable and\
    \ effective non-destructive techniques. Surface wave methods have<br>\ngained\
    \ popularity over the last decades since they monitor the propagation of the surface\
    \ wave with<br>\nnon-invasive transducers working from the surface. Nonetheless,\
    \ their use is restricted by resolution<br>\nproblems and their ability to assess\
    \ the actual dispersive behaviour of Rayleigh wave. Nondestructive,<br>\nin-situ\
    \ methods for characterizing existing infrastructures require the ability to detect<br>\n\
    structural damage and features such as cracking and discontinuities. The proper\
    \ assessment of the<br>\nlocation and of the extension of such discontinuities\
    \ is crucial for the determination of the level of<br>\ndeterioration of an infrastructure\
    \ and for planning the maintenance interventions. Damage in a<br>\npavement structure\
    \ is usually initiated in the asphalt layers, making the Rayleigh wave ideally\
    \ suited<br>\nfor the detection of shallow surface defects. Nonetheless, the practical\
    \ application of crack detection<br>\nmethods in asphalt is hampered due to the\
    \ heterogeneous and dispersive nature of the material tested.<br>\nThis thesis\
    \ describes new signal processing methods and the novel application of existing\
    \ methods<br>\nto tackle the problems that hinder the non-destructive surface\
    \ wave methods.<br>\nThe spectral convolution method proposed in this thesis,\
    \ based on the simultaneous exploitation of<br>\nthe vertical and the horizontal\
    \ components of a seismic event, improved the resolution and the overall<br>\n\
    accuracy of the spectral image in the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain. Hence,\
    \ it led to more<br>\naccurate seismic inversion by reducing the amount of uncertainty\
    \ coming from a seismic survey.<br>\nThis research investigated the use of this\
    \ new proposed method in soils and asphalts for the measurement of surface wave\
    \ dispersion through conceptual analysis and numerical investigation<br>\nalongside\
    \ experimental investigation on soil and asphalt.<br>\nThe application of spectral\
    \ wave methods and the transformation of the wavefield into the frequencywavenumber<br>\n\
    domain allowed the identification of the position and the extension of vertical\
    \ defects.<br>\nThe joint use of the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves and\
    \ the Multiple Impact of Surface<br>\nWaves methods in numerical and experimental\
    \ investigations presented in this thesis proved to be<br>\neffective for crack\
    \ detection and sizing. Moreover, the space-normalised seismogram helped in the<br>\n\
    interpretation of f-k spectra for cracks detection.<br>\nHere, the wave decomposition\
    \ method for crack interrogation consisted of a signal processing<br>\nalgorithm\
    \ capable of computing the direct and reflected waves\u2019 amplitudes and phase\
    \ angles from<br>\nthe signals of a deployment of sensors. It solved linear systems\
    \ with a number of measurements much<br>\nbigger than the number of unknowns.\
    \ It tackled the measurement errors naturally present in<br>\nexperimental data\
    \ by finding a least square approximate solution with the help of the pseudo-inverse<br>\n\
    matrix for overdetermined systems. The results coming from numerical simulations\
    \ and experimental<br>\ninvestigations showed the effectiveness of the wave decomposition\
    \ method for the assessment of the<br>\nlocation and of the depth of surface-breaking\
    \ cracks in the half-space and in layered systems.<br>\nContrary to other techniques,\
    \ it was able to cope with the heterogeneities and the dispersive nature<br>\n\
    of layered system, thus making possible to detect and assess the depth of surface-breaking\
    \ cracks in<br>\nroads."
