  title: Geophysical Studies in Soil Investigations
  abstract: "Abstract The contributions of geophysical engineering in soil studies\
    \ are very important. Geophysical studies are extremely important, especially\
    \ in areas with earthquake risk, both in construction and in settlements. This\
    \ study was carried out in order to find out the ground parameters in Istanbul-Esenyurt\
    \ province and to determine the inequality. The methods used in the study are\
    \ the MASW, micro tremor and laboratory experiments.\_ The MASW technique is an\
    \ improved method for obtaining the shear wave velocity of shallow layers. It\
    \ is also the name of all kinds of vibrations that exist in the ground, except\
    \ for short-term earthquakes or explosions. As in earthquake seismology, the spectrum\
    \ of a noise measured in the field consists of the characteristics of the source\
    \ causing the noise and the ground structure characteristics of the land from\
    \ which the measurement is taken. The site effect is important in engineering\
    \ seismology because it can cause amplitudes of seismic waves to increase during\
    \ an earthquake. Later on, drillings were made where necessary to obtain information\
    \ about the soil parameters."
