  title: Research on the Effect of Water Draining Through Vertical Drainage Systems
    in the Process of Soil Consolidation
  abstract: A saturated soil subjected to a growing total effort will reduce gradually
    the volume up to excess pore water pressure dissipation, interfering primary consolidation.
    This process can take a long time and when all excess pressure is dissipated,
    the soil is considered consolidated.In low permeability soils, from external loading,
    results in an increase of the normal effort at higher values than the earth preconsolidation
    pressure, thus having neutral increased pressure followed by a consolidation process
    where water is expelled from the pores of the soil. The decrease in porosity (soil
    volume), so produced, is accompanied by a gradual increase of effective pressure
    and a corresponding decrease in excess pore water pressure. The consolidation
    process continues until the excess pore water pressure dissipates only complete
    and upload translates into effective stress. Duration of the process depends on
    the consolidation characteristics of the soil and drainage ways (with how much
    drainage paths are longer, the longer is the process of consolidation). The purpose
    of installing vertical drains is to shorten the drainage ways and time needed
    to dissipate the neutral pressure. The time to dissipate the excess water pressure
    in the pores (time consolidation) is so short as the inter-distance between the
    drains is less.
