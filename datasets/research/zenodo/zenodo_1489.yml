  title: The Impact of Heavy Metals on the Soil in Calabar Metropolis Lemna Area
  abstract: 'Soil samples were collected from the dumpsite soil located at Lemna Road,
    Calabar Municipality, Cross River State, Nigeria to investigate the speciation
    and bioavailability of some trace metals namely: iron, cadmium, copper, zinc and
    lead. Extract from the soil were obtained by sequential extraction. This involved
    Acid extractable fraction, Oxidisable fraction, Reducible fraction and Residual
    fraction. These fraction were then analyzed for Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn using acetylene
    flame atomic absorption spectrophometer. The results obtained, showed that the
    metals occurred with the following percentage bioavailability: Fe (33.57%), Zn
    (43.59%), Cd (67.23%), Cu (82.98%) and Lead (69.96%). Acid extractable 5.57% reducible
    fraction accounted for over 9.33% of the total fractions, metal bound to residual
    and oxidisable fraction accounted for 10.90% and 13.05% respectively. Fe has the
    highest distribution in all the fractions followed by Zn while Cd has the least
    in all the fractions. The results of these findings indicates that the trace metals
    with exception of Cd were readily bioavailable in the dumpsite soil therefore,
    phytoremediation is advocated.'
