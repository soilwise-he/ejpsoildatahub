  title: EFFECT OF "BIST" AND "BIST-M" BIO-PREPARATIONS ON CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF
    NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM RECEIVED BY PLANTS IN THE SOIL
  abstract: It has been shown that salinity, which occurs in the case of agricultural
    practices, occurs when the amount of salts formed in the root system of the plant
    is low, and the amount of drainage water is low. The problem of low productivity
    of saline soils is explained not only by the toxicity of salts or the damage of
    plants by excess salt in the root tissues, but also by the lack of organic and
    mineral substances, especially N, P and K.
