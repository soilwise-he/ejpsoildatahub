  title: Critical stress evaluation of rigid pavement due to the presence of water
    in expansive soil subgrade
  abstract: The use of various types of rigid pavement is widespread because of its
    superiority in resisting heavy load vehicles. However, traffic loading complexity
    and subgrade response cause uncertainty during the design process. The presence
    of water in expansive soil issue swelling affected the flexural behavior of a
    rigid pavement slab. Rigid pavement relies heavily on the support and stability
    of the subgrade. Plain concrete is very weak in resisting tensile stresses so
    that the failure of rigid pavement slab structures often occurs in the expansive
    subgrade zone. Therefore, this study aims to numerically analyze the relationship
    between variations in the thickness of rigid pavement slabs on the flexural behavior
    parameters, such as critical and tensile stresses that affected water in expansive
    soil. The concrete's performance limit was determined, using its material's constitutive
    equation curve, and the data were analyzed using the finite element method. The
    results showed that the presence of water in expansive soil caused a change in
    soil volume (swelling), a reduction in soil bearing capacity (shrinking), and
    consequently, a rigid pavement cracked due to water variations in the subgrade.
    Generally, increasing the thickness of rigid pavement is a common method for mitigating
    the detrimental effects of expansive soil swelling. It is possible to provide
    reinforcement in other forms, which provide an opportunity to improve the performance
    of the concrete slab as a rigid pavement. For example, stabilization of expansive
    soil with materials capable of reducing its expansive power can be done but it
    requires large resources to realize it. Another method is to provide reinforcement
    to the rigid pavement slab structure, so that the rigid pavement slab is able
    to withstand traffic loads and also the expansion and shrinkage behavior of the
    expansive soil
