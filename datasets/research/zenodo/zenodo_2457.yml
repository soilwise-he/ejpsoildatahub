  title: "Crop growth, carbon sequestration and soil erosion in an organic vineyard\
    \ of the Vill\xE1ny Wine District, Southwest Hungary"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A more resilient adaptation to changing climate calls for crop
    diversification in vineyards, too. As a contribution&lt;br&gt;

    to the H2020 collaborative project of the European Union, called Diverfarming,
    and part of the agroecological&lt;br&gt;

    experiments during 2018 and 2019, grapevine biomass growth was monitored in connection
    with carbon storage&lt;br&gt;

    types in soil and in the deposits removed by soil erosion. Phenometry was carried
    out interpreting segmented&lt;br&gt;

    images to follow changes in biomass. It was found that crop growth could be best
    described by the Richards&lt;br&gt;

    growth function. The distinction between grapevine and intercrop growth, however,
    requires further refinement&lt;br&gt;

    in image analysis. In the laboratory TOC and Ntotal were measured for both the
    soil and the plant organs&lt;br&gt;

    as well as for the eroded sediments. Greenhouse gas emissions and photosynthesis
    were monitored. Looking&lt;br&gt;

    at the change of Leaf Area Index (LAI) over the growing period, image analysis
    pointed out the role of cut&lt;br&gt;

    shoots from pruning in the C and N cycles. Maximum leaf area (at ripening) for
    guyot cultivation technique was&lt;br&gt;

    extimated at 7,840 m2 ha-1. Soil loss by erosion was established by sediment traps
    at the end of vinestock rows.&lt;br&gt;

    The grain size distribution analysis led to the remarkable result that as erosion
    proceeded, the ratio of the sand&lt;br&gt;

    fraction increased but remained within the range for the textural class of loam.
    Organic matter contents grew&lt;br&gt;

    to 38 g kg-1. The rate of soil erosion is higher in ploughed than in grassed interrows
    by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;'
