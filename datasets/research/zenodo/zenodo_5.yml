  title: Soil Health &amp; Soil Heritage Project - Workshop Reports
  abstract: 'This archive contains reports on workshops organised by the Soil Health
    &amp; Soil Heritage Project. It mirrors content linked from the ipaast-czo project
    website. This project aimed to build links between groups exploring how soils
    in farmed landscapes are qualified, studied, modelled, and valued from different
    perspectives: agricultural, environmental, and archaeological. It focused on data
    created through remote and near-surface sensing technologies to provide an impetus
    for cross-disciplinary conversations, because these data have the potential to
    serve as a shared resource for research and management. The project aimed to identify
    shared research and management priorities related to soil health and soil heritage
    in agricultural landscapes, to evaluate the capability of commercial and experimental
    sensors to provide data to address these shared priorities, and to identify barriers
    to the creation of interoperable remote and near-surface sensing data resources
    on soils and their role in agricultural systems. The project was led by a group
    of researchers at the University of Glasgow, working on initiatives including
    agri-environment sensing projects in CENSIS, the Global Soil Heath network, and
    the ipaast-czo project on archaeological remote and near-surface sensing. In 2022,
    the project reviewed instruments to assess their suitability for cross-domain
    data collection and ran two workshops, in Dalswinton and Glasgow, to build a research
    and practice network focused on sensing methods for soils.'
