  title: 'Soil Classification At Family Categories From Tertiary Volcanic Rock Formation
    With Different Type Of Lithology:     A Case Study Of Indonesia'
  abstract: This research aims to classify the characteristic of soil that development
    from Tertiary Volcanic Rock Formation for land management to increase soil bearing
    capacity. A field survey, rock and soil morphological description, and laboratory
    analysis carried out to describe soil properties and weathering grade of rock.
    Weathering grade of lithology characterized by Santi method and clay minerals
    identification with X-ray Diffractometer. The Soil classified with soil taxonomy
    key USDA 2014. The andesite and volcanic breccia lithologies have the II-III-IV
    grade of weathering from bottom to the soil surface. The soil was acidic to slightly
    acidic and the CEC was 18.69-24.25cmol<sup>+</sup>/kg. The CEC value influenced
    by the presence of kaolinite more than montmorillonite, but base saturation was
    higher than &gt;35% and formed cambic horizon on soil from volcanic breccia. The
    soil development from andesite lava volcanic classified asVitrandic Dystrudepts
    and volcanic breccia classified as Mixed Ruptic-Alfic Dystrudepts. The Mixed Ruptic-Alfic
    Dystrudepts showed the presence of 16.8% of montmorillonite and 11.1% of vermiculite
    minerals that indicate a high potential to decrease soil bearing capacity and
    triggering a deep landslide in this area.
