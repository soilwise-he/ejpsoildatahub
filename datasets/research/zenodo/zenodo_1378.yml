  title: Mathematical Modeling of Tractor Fuel Consumption for Ridging Operation in
    Sandy Loamy Soil
  abstract: "<em>The need to use selected soil-implement-machine parameters as factors\
    \ affecting fuel consumption is essential. A mathematical model for predicting\
    \ tractor fuel consumption per working area for ridging operation has been developed\
    \ using Buckingham\u2019s pi theorem in dimensional analysis. Generalized reduced\
    \ gradient (GRG), a nonlinear method of Excel solver was used for the establishment\
    \ of the model\u2019s constant. The model was validated by simulating the experimental\
    \ results using the equation, graphical comparison, and assessing the coefficient\
    \ determination (r<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error, and paired t-Test. The\
    \ field experiment was performed at Rivers Institute of Agricultural Research\
    \ and Training (RIART) Farm in Rivers State University, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.\
    \ The group balanced block design (GBBD) was adopted. The design consisted of\
    \ 9 experimental treatments with three replicates. The experimental fuel consumption\
    \ per working area was determined by quantity of fuel used per working area with\
    \ the aid of fuel flow meter. The field test parameters (speed, height, forward\
    \ speed, cone index, bulk density) were measured accordingly with their specific\
    \ standards procedures. The field test parameters (speed, height, forward speed,\
    \ cone index, bulk density) results were simulated with fuel consumption to obtain\
    \ the constant in the predictive mathematical model. The developed model displayed\
    \ good agreement between measured and predicted results with high coefficient\
    \ of determination and low root mean square error. The paired t-Test results also\
    \ showed no significant difference at 95 and 99 % confidence levels. It is thus,\
    \ suggested that the model be used for predicting tractor fuel consumption during\
    \ ridging operation</em><em>.</em>"
