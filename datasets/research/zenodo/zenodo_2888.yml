  title: 'Low density-microplastics detected in sheep faeces and soil: A case study
    from the intensive vegetable farming in Southeast Spain'
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;One of the main sources of plastic pollution in agricultural\
    \ fields is the plastic mulch used by farmers to improve crop production. The\
    \ plastic mulch is often not removed completely from the fields after harvest.\
    \ Over time, the plastic mulch that is left of the fields is broken down into\
    \ smaller particles which are dispersed by the wind or runoff. In the Region of\
    \ Murcia in Spain, plastic mulch is heavily used for intensive vegetable farming.\
    \ After harvest, sheep are released into the fields to graze on the vegetable\
    \ residues. The objective of the study was to assess the plastic contamination\
    \ in agricultural soil in Spain and the ingestion of plastic by sheep. Therefore,\
    \ three research questions were established: i) What is the plastic content in\
    \ agricultural soils where plastic mulch is commonly used? ii) Do livestock ingest\
    \ the microplastics found in the soil? iii) How much plastic could be transported\
    \ by the livestock? To answer these questions, we sampled top soils (0&ndash;10&nbsp;cm)\
    \ from 6 vegetable fields and collected sheep faeces from 5 different herds. The\
    \ microplastic content was measured using density separation and visual identification.\
    \ We found ~2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;particles\u2219\
    kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;in the soil and ~10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;particles\u2219\
    kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;in the faeces. The data show that plastic\
    \ particles were present in the soil and that livestock ingested them. After ingesting\
    \ plastic from one field, the sheep can become a source of microplastic contamination\
    \ as they graze on other farms or grasslands. The potential transport of microplastics\
    \ due to a herd of 1000 sheep was estimated to be ~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&nbsp;particles\u2219\
    ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;\u2219y&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Further\
    \ studies should focus on: assessing how much of the plastic found in faeces comes\
    \ directly from plastic mulching, estimating the plastic degradation in the guts\
    \ of sheep and understanding the potential effects of these plastic residues on\
    \ the health of livestock.&lt;/p&gt;"
