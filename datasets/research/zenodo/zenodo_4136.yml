  title: Pollution Load Index of Heavy Metals in Soil around the Vicinity of Automobile
    Servicing Workshops in Bori Metropolis, Rivers State, Nigeria
  abstract: "Abstract Heavy metals in soils are of great environmental concern. In\
    \ order to determine the pollution load index of some heavy metal contents and\
    \ their distribution in surface soil around the vicinity of automobile servicing\
    \ workshops in Bori metropolis, sixteen surface soil samples were collected, prepared,\
    \ digested and analysed for Cu, Mn, Cd, Pb, Fe, Cr and Ni\_ using atomic absorption\
    \ spectrophotometry (AAS). In the investigated soil samples, the mean recorded\
    \ concentrations of the heavy metals were 9.344 mg/kg for Cu, 4.867 mg/kg for\
    \ Ni, 0.022 mg/ kg for Cd, 138.556 mg/kg for Fe, 6.856 mg/kg for Mn, 7.632 mg/kg\
    \ for Cr and 4.889 mg/kg for Pb. The obtained results indicates that the enrichment\
    \ factors of the measured heavy metals were 4.31, 2.79, <0.02, 1.48, 1.85, 3.85,\
    \ and 4.29 for copper, nickel, cadmium, iron, manganese, chromium and lead respectively.\
    \ I-geo (geo-accumulation index) values of the metals in the soils under study\
    \ indicates that they were uncontaminated to moderately contaminated with copper\
    \ and lead, but highly contaminated with iron and manganese and moderately polluted\
    \ with nickel and cadmium. The investigated soil samples from the results of the\
    \ study does not pose any challenge for agricultural and any intended use for\
    \ now."
