  title: Effect Of Sand Or Soil As A Dietary Component On Phosphorus Utilization
  abstract: Experiment was conducted to determine the effect of sand or soil ingestion
    on P balance in Goats. 12 Africa Dwarf goats (44.9kg) were fed a based diet containing
    10% of either soil (the mould in which plants grow - the mixture of disintegrated
    rock and organic material which nourishes plant) or sand (a mass of rounded grains
    of rocks) in a completely randomized design.  Animals were injected iv with a
    single does of .5cm; of <sup>32</sup>p as orthophosphoric acid to facilitate determination
    of metabolic fecal P. Total fecal and urine collections were made for 7 d and
    blood samples were obtained three times. Levels of A1, Fe and Mn for the sand
    diet were 46, 199 and 36ppm, and for basal diet 147, 88 and 35ppm.  Goats fed
    the sand diets had lower (P&gt;.05) serum P concentration than goats fed soil
    diet.  Total and metabolic fecal P were higher (P &gt; .05) and urinary P lower
    (P &lt; .05) for goats fed sand resulting in lower (P &gt; 01) apparent and true
    P absorption and P balance for these two diets compared with the soil diet.
