  title: Numerical Analysis of Soil Slope Stabilization by Soil Nailing Technique
  abstract: Slope instability may be a result of change in stress conditions, rise
    in groundwater table and rainfall. Similarly, many slopes that have been stable
    for several years can abruptly fail due to changes in geometry, weak soil shear
    strength or as an external forces effect. Debris flows (i.e. slope failures) take
    place without any warning and can have devastating results. So, it is vital to
    understand the slope failure mechanism and adopt safety prevention measures. Soil
    nailing is one of the widely used stabilization techniques for soil slopes. In
    this study, soil nail technique is proposed to upgrade the existing slope in clay.
    A parametric study was conducted to understand the effects of different nail diameter
    (i.e. 25mm and 40mm) and nail inclination (i.e. 20<sup>0</sup>, 25<sup>0</sup>,
    30<sup>0</sup>, 35<sup>0</sup> and 40<sup>0</sup>) on slope stability. Morgenstern-Price
    (i.e. limit equilibrium) method was used to determine the factor of safety of
    the slope. It was found that the factor of safety of the existing slope improved
    significantly with three rows of 40mm diameter nail at inclination of 40<sup>0</sup>.
