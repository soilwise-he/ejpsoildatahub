  title: Design method for horizontal drains in liquefiable soil
  abstract: The paper describes a fast design method for horizontal drains to be used
    as a mitigation technique for liquefaction, developed in the framework of the
    European project LIQUEFACT. During the earthquake, this ground improvement technique
    allows to reduce the pore pressure build up under existing buildings, where more
    conventional vertical drains cannot be used (being it difficult to install them).
    By reducing the pore pressure increments, the horizontal drains can reduce the
    liquefaction risk for shallow foundations. The problem is modelled with a bidimensional
    geometry, applying the consolidation equation in the hypothesis of Terzaghi-Rendulic
    and solving it with a finite difference method. The solution is calculated for
    different geometrical layouts and removing the simplified hypothesis (used to
    design vertical drains) of an indefinite symmetry; moreover, it takes into account
    the influence of a vertical water flow when drainage is allowed at the ground
    level. The pore pressure build-up is introduced in a simplified manner with an
    accumulation term suggested in literature. A parametric analysis has been performed
    and is reported in the paper to obtain design charts. They may be used to define
    the spacing between drains once the geometric layout, the ground conditions and
    the seismic input are defined.
