  title: Landcover Mapping Using Lidar Data And Aerial Image And Soil Fertility Degradation
    Assessment For Rice Production Area In Quezon, Nueva Ecija, Philippines
  abstract: Land-cover maps were important for many scientific, ecological and land
    management purposes and during the last decades, rapid decrease of soil fertility
    was observed to be due to land use practices such as rice cultivation. High-precision
    land-cover maps are not yet available in the area which is important in an economy
    management. To assure   accurate mapping of land cover to provide information,
    remote sensing is a very suitable tool to carry out this task and automatic land
    use and cover detection. The study did not only provide high precision land cover
    maps but it also provides estimates of rice production area that had undergone
    chemical degradation due to fertility decline. Land-cover were delineated and
    classified into pre-defined classes to achieve proper detection features. After
    generation of Land-cover map, of high intensity of rice cultivation, soil fertility
    degradation assessment in rice production area due to fertility decline was created
    to assess the impact of soils used in agricultural production. Using Simple spatial
    analysis functions and ArcGIS, the Land-cover map of Municipality of Quezon in
    Nueva Ecija, Philippines was overlaid to the fertility decline maps from Land
    Degradation Assessment Philippines- Bureau of Soils and Water Management (LADA-Philippines-BSWM)
    to determine the area of rice crops that were most likely where nitrogen, phosphorus,
    zinc and sulfur deficiencies were induced by high dosage of urea and imbalance
    N:P fertilization. The result found out that 80.00 % of fallow and 99.81% of rice
    production area has high soil fertility decline.
