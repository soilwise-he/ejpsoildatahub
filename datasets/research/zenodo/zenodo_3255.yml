  title: Effects of compost from urban solid household waste on the respiration of
    soil microbial flora and the yield of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) at the
    agronomic experimental station of Lome in Togo
  abstract: The objective of the study is to evaluate the respiration of the microbial
    flora of soils amended with household waste compost under tomato cultivation.
    The experimental device adopted was that of complete random blocks with three
    repetitions. The compost was applied in doses of 10 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>, 20 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>,
    30 t.ha<sup>-1</sup> and 40 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>. To these treatments are added those
    of absolute control, mineral fertilization (0.2 t.ha<sup>-1</sup> of NPK 15-15-15
    and 0.1 t.ha-1 of Urea 46% N) and organo fertilization -mineral (10 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>
    of compost combined with 0.1 t.ha<sup>-1</sup> of NPK 15-15-15 and 0.05 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>
    of Urea 46% N). Soil samples were taken from the plots at a depth of 0 - 20 cm
    and incubated in the laboratory for the evaluation of the respiration of the microbial
    flora. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission was measured daily for 28 days of incubation
    using NaOH and 0.1 N HCl as titrant after precipitating the carbonate with barium
    chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution by alkaline back titration in the presence
    of the colored indicator (phenolphthalein). The results showed that the application
    of compost from household waste induced an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emission
    from the soil (60.67-215.4 mg.kg-1 of soil) and fruit yield of tomato (8.61-36.43
    t.ha<sup>-1</sup>). Thus the application of compost at the dose of 30 t.ha<sup>-1</sup>
    improves soil biological activity and tomato fruit yield.
