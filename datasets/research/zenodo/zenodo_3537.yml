  title: Evaluation Of Aquifer Protective Capacity And Soil Corrosivity Using Geoelectrical
    Method
  abstract: "A geoelectric survey was carried out in some parts of<br>\nAngwan Gwari,\
    \ an outskirt of Lapai Local Government Area on<br>\nNiger State which belongs\
    \ to the Nigerian Basement Complex, with<br>\nthe aim of evaluating the soil corrosivity,\
    \ aquifer transmissivity and<br>\nprotective capacity of the area from which aquifer\
    \ characterisation<br>\nwas made. The G41 Resistivity Meter was employed to obtain\
    \ fifteen<br>\nSchlumberger Vertical Electrical Sounding data along profiles in\
    \ a<br>\nsquare grid network. The data were processed using interpex 1-D<br>\n\
    sounding inversion software, which gives vertical electrical sounding<br>\ncurves\
    \ with layered model comprising of the apparent resistivities,<br>\noverburden\
    \ thicknesses, and depth. This information was used to<br>\nevaluate longitudinal\
    \ conductance and transmissivities of the layers.<br>\nThe results show generally\
    \ low resistivities across the survey area<br>\nand an average longitudinal conductance\
    \ variation from<br>\n0.0237Siemens in VES 6 to 0.1261Siemens in VES 15 with almost<br>\n\
    the entire area giving values less than 1.0 Siemens. The average<br>\ntransmissivity\
    \ values range from 96.45 \u03A9.m2 in VES 4 to 299070<br>\n\u03A9.m2 in VES 1.\
    \ All but VES 4 and VES14 had an average<br>\noverburden greater than 400 \u03A9\
    .m2, these results suggest that the<br>\naquifers are highly permeable to fluid\
    \ movement within, leading to<br>\nthe possibility of enhanced migration and circulation\
    \ of contaminants<br>\nin the groundwater system and that the area is generally\
    \ corrosive."
