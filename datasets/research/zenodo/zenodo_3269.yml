  title: Development of Eco Materials and Use of TIC as New Technology to Improve
    the Use of Water and Soil that Optimizes the Crop of Asparagus in Arid Environments
    of the Northwest of Mexico
  abstract: "<em>The efficient use of water and the adequate preparation of soils\
    \ in cultivation areas of the northwestern region of the Mexican Republic, where\
    \ the state of Baja California is located, have managed to improve the yield of\
    \ vegetable crops based on the development of computerized technology and the\
    \ application of an eco material such as those that have been evaluated to be\
    \ used as pipes through which water circulates for cultivation activities. The\
    \ applied eco material is fiberglass or also called glass wool, from crashed cars\
    \ in the city of Mexicali and that were recycled, and with a manufacturing process\
    \ tubes were made, creating pipes through which water circulates with controlled\
    \ temperature for activities of crops. This type of material was used because\
    \ it has the physicochemical property of being able to keep the water temperature\
    \ around 25 \xB0C, which is suitable for growing vegetables such as asparagus\
    \ in the Mexicali Valley, which is considered a zone arid To optimize the cultivation\
    \ of asparagus, an evaluation of physicochemical factors such as pH and water\
    \ temperature was made, as well as the amount of vital liquid per hectare for\
    \ irrigation of asparagus, in addition to soil salinity, to obtain the best yield\
    \ in the cultivation of this valued vegetable. To control the physicochemical\
    \ factors mentioned, computerized technology was used with a low-cost electronic\
    \ system and using the C language for computer control of the systems or sensors\
    \ of the physicochemical factors of agricultural activities. The research study\
    \ reflected an increase in the productivity of asparagus in this area of </em><em></em><em>the\
    \ Mexican Republic and with this an action was generated to be used in cultivation\
    \ processes in other types of regions as a comparative analysis. This investigation\
    \ was made from 2018 to 2020. In the Covid19 pandemic was made the investigation\
    \ with strict regulations.</em>"
