  title: RATE ANALYSIS OF SOIL EROSION USING UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION (USLE) METHOD
    IN JENEBERANG WATERSHED
  abstract: Erosion in a watershed is a complex phenomenon that affects the quality
    of land resources due to either natural or human influence. The purpose of this
    study to determine the rate of erosion in the Jeneberang watershed and produce
    a recommendation of soil conservation to reduce the rate of erosion. This study
    uses some parameter maps, such as Rain Erosivitas Index (R) map, Land Erodibility
    Index (K) map, Length and Slopes Declivity Factor (LS) map, and Plants Management
    Factor and Soil Conservation (CP). All parameters were analysed using USLE map
    to determine the rate of erosion. The analysis results the rate of erosion by
    USLE method indicates the hazard level of the erosion in the Jeneberang watershed
    are dominantly at the very low levels with an area 55.068,39 ha or 71.6% of the
    research area. However, the erosion in the study area can not be ignored because
    there is a very high level of danger to the extensive erosion 11.681,55 or 15%
    of the research area. Therefore, generated a recommendation of soil conservation
    by soil cover planting and terrace construction repairs. By this conservation
    recommendation, the area with a high level of the rate of erosion reduce in the
    amount of 10,6%.
