  title: 'Soil solarization based on natural soil moisture: a practical approach for
    reducing the seed bank of invasive plants in wetlands'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Soil solarization is a well-established method to disinfect
    soil for efficient weed control. However, the feasibility of applying this method
    in the restoration of invaded natural habitats is unclear. This is because soil
    moisture is necessary for the success of solarization, but pre-irrigation in natural
    ecosystems is often not applicable, or demands high labor investment, making it
    unsuitable for use in restoration. The present study was based on the idea that
    the relatively high soil moisture in wetlands might obviate the need for pre-irrigation,
    rendering this method much more applicable in natural habitats. We examined the
    efficacy of soil solarization using natural soil moisture to control the seed
    bank of the invasive plant, Acacia saligna, in a wetland, using large-scale experimental
    plots (0.38 ha each). An old, dense A. saligna grove was cut down and the roots
    were removed by a bulldozer. The plot was mulched with a transparent polyethylene
    sheet in early July and left on the soil for 14 weeks. Soil solarization significantly
    reduced the viability of seeds of A. saligna that had been experimentally buried.
    Additionally, viability of seeds in the natural seed bank was reduced, and seedling
    emergence was close to zero. Exposing seeds to soil temperature and soil moisture
    levels equivalent to those obtained during field soil solarization under controlled
    conditions significantly increased the release from dormancy of the seeds, suggesting
    that release from dormancy during the early stage of solarization is a critical
    stage leading to seed weakening or mortality in the soil. Soil solarization also
    decreased the cover and abundance of the natural vegetation; therefore, active
    revegetation is required to restore the natural vegetation and to conserve endangered
    and endemic species.&lt;/p&gt;'
