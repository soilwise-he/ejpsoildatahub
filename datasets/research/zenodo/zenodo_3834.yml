  title: 'Impact Of Quarrying And Crushing On Soil Quality: A Case Study In Tumkur
    District, Karnataka'
  abstract: A study was carried out on the impact of quarrying and crushing waste
    on the quality of soil in Tumkur District. The quarries located in different parts
    of Tumkur District produces quarry wastes (aggregates), blasted materials (fly
    rocks), chemicals (explosives used for blasting) and dust (granite powder) generated
    from activity are spread and settled in the surrounding area. The soil samples
    were collected both near and away from the quarry and crushing sites. The collected
    samples were analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters viz temperature,
    pH, EC, organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, manganese,
    iron and boron using standard methods. The results revealed the deterioration
    of soil quality near the quarrying and crushing sites and this can be attributed
    due to the accumulation of dust. The soil properties are less affected away from
    the quarry sites.
