  title: Informational Technology For Model Operation Of The List And Collapses Of
    The Base Of The Building Because Of Influence Of The Water Saturation Of The Soil
  abstract: "Results of a research on clarification of regularities of a list and\
    \ collapse of the base the building depending on the degree of a water saturation\
    \ of the layered soil basis received by information technology are given in the\
    \ article: computer modelling of the VAT by means of MKE on the basis of the model\
    \ of the inclined and laminated massif of Zh. S. Erzhanov, Sh. M. Aitaliyev, Zh.\
    \ K. Masanov. Problem definition is proved by the analysis of mass collapses of\
    \ houses of the whole residential district \u201CBesoba\u201D of the city of Karaganda\
    \ of Kazakhstan. Ephyra of deformation of the base and buildings depending on\
    \ the direction, volume and places of penetration of filtration waters into the\
    \ soil basis with numerical data are shown.\n\nThe detailed analysis of results\
    \ of researches is stated."
