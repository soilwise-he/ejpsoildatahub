  title: 'Bioremediation Of Meg, Deg, And Teg: Potential Of Burhead Plant And Soil
    Microorganisms'
  abstract: The aim of this work was to investigate the potential of soil microorganisms
    and the burhead plant, as well as the combination of soil microorganisms and plants
    to remediate monoethylene glycol (MEG), diethylene glycol (DEG), and triethylene
    glycol (TEG) in synthetic wastewater. The result showed that a system containing
    both burhead plant and soil microorganisms had the highest efficiency in EGs removal.
    Around 100% of MEG and DEG and 85% of TEG were removed within 15 days of the experiments.
    However, the burhead plant had higher removal efficiency than soil microorganisms
    for MEG and DEG but the same for TEG in the study systems. The removal rate of
    EGs in the study system related to the molecular weight of the compounds and MEG,
    the smallest glycol, was removed faster than DEG and TEG by both the burhead plant
    and soil microorganisms in the study system.
