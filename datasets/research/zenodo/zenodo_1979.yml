  title: Influence Of Biochar Amendment On Soil Water Characteristics And Crop Growth
    Enhancement Under Salinity Stress
  abstract: Salinity is an important environmental constraint to crop productivity
    in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Most crop plants, including tomato
    (<em>Lycopersicon esculentum</em> Mill), are sensitive to salinity throughout
    the ontogeny of the plant. Biochar was used in the present study to improve the
    available water content (AWC), growth, yield and irrigation water use efficiency
    of tomato plant under saline soil condition. The biochar was applied at the rates
    of, 0%, 2% and 4% w/w and expressed as Ck (control), T1 and T2, respectively.
    The experiment was conducted in the pots inside the greenhouse. The results showed
    that soil bulk density, field capacity, permanent wilting point, AWC, and soil
    organic matter were improved significantly as biochar application rate increased.
    Biochar application also enhanced plant height, stem diameter, plant fresh and
    dry weights and yield components of tomato plant. It was found that biochar application
    at T2 treatment in the whole growing period was best to improve tomato plant growth
    and yield, providing a biochar amendment recommendation for tomato production
    in field. Moreover, biochar application improved the irrigation water use efficiency.
    Therefore, biochar amendment could be an effective option to improve saline soil
    which affected croplands.
