  title: Real-time soil monitoring and irrigation system for taro yam cultivation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The yam cultivation industry faces hurdles in satisfying the
    world&rsquo;s rising demand. Meanwhile, &nbsp;agricultural activities encounter
    &nbsp; issues&nbsp;such as monitoring systems for soil composition that are not
    directly integrated with the irrigation system. Hence, this research aims to develop
    an irrigation and soil monitoring system using NodeMcu ESP8266 for&nbsp;taro&nbsp;yam
    cultivation. A soil &nbsp;composition and irrigation device weredeveloped using
    NodeMcu ESP8266 to control the irrigation system autonomously. Then, the real-time
    monitoring systems using Blynk 2.0 was designed. The final method is used to test
    the irrigation and soil monitoring system in a taro yam growing area. The&nbsp;results
    &nbsp;show &nbsp;that &nbsp;the irrigation &nbsp;and &nbsp;soil &nbsp;monitoring
    system reduced water &nbsp;usage &nbsp;by &nbsp;about &nbsp;32.5%, &nbsp;as &nbsp;the
    &nbsp;3.6 &nbsp;liters &nbsp;of &nbsp;water &nbsp;used &nbsp;daily &nbsp;before
    applying the irrigation and soil monitoring device was reduced to 2.43 liters
    per &nbsp;day. In conclusion, &nbsp;the &nbsp;developed &nbsp;device &nbsp;can
    conveniently &nbsp;display the ambient &nbsp;air&rsquo;s &nbsp;humidity, &nbsp;temperature,
    and soil moisture conditions &nbsp;on smartphones &nbsp; and &nbsp; desktops.&nbsp;In
    addition,&nbsp;this system&nbsp;can&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;soil moisture according
    to a set value, which can prevent excessive water use for taro yam cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;'
