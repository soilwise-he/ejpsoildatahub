  title: Contribution of Agricultural Wastes on Soil Aggregation, Soil Properties
    and Yield of Maize on Acidic Soil
  abstract: The stability of soil aggregates against the impact of rainfall has become
    vital especially in South-eastern Nigeria whose soils are too fragile due to high
    rainfall distribution in the zone that facilities soil erosion. In trying to finding
    out ways of improving the aggregate stability of soils, two agricultural wastes
    (poultry droppings (PD) and saw dust ash (SDA) were applied individually and in
    combination of both at varying rates to evaluate its effects on soil aggregate
    stability, soil physicochemical properties and yield of maize. A randomized complete
    block design was used and the treatments were replicated three times. Pre and
    post planting soil samples were collected and analysed for physical and chemical
    soil properties using standard methods. Data collected from soil analyses and
    growth performances of maize were subjected to analysis of variance and significant
    treatment means were separated using least significant difference at 0.05 probability
    level. Results showed that plots amended with 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA increased
    soil organic carbon by 25.4 %, soil total nitrogen by 25.7 %, effective cation
    exchange capacity by 34.3 % and base saturation by 19.2 %. Plots amended with
    10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA reduced clay ratio (CR), clay dispersion index (CDI)
    and dispersion ratio (DR) by 75.2 %, 84.9 % and 93.7 % respectively while clay
    flocculation index (CFI) was increased by 82.3 %. The highest maize yield (74
    kg/ha) was recorded from plots amended with 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA. Therefore
    10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA was recommended for improvement of soil properties, soil
    aggregate stability and yield of maize in acid soil.
