  title: INVESTIGATION OF AMMONIUM THIOSULFATE, SODIUM THIOSULFATE AND 1,2,4-TRIAZOLE
    (UREASE INHIBITORS) ON THE ACTIVITY OF UREASE IN WHEAT SOIL OF FAISALABAD, SHEIKHUPURA
    AND GUJRANWALA REGION
  abstract: "This paper describes the inhibition effect of different urease inhibitors\
    \ i.e. Ammonium Thiosulfate, Sodium Thiosulfate and 1,2,4-Triazole on the activity\
    \ of urease enzyme in wheat soil of 3 different districts of Punjab, Pakistan.\
    \ Urease is a nickel dependent metalloenzyme that is involved in the hydrolysis\
    \ of urea, forming Carbon dioxide and ammonia. Urea hydrolysis leads to the excessive\
    \ nitrogen loss in the form of ammonia volatilization. Main purpose of the study\
    \ was to check the potential of different blended inhibitors (Ammonium Thiosulfate\
    \ + Sodium Thiosulfate + 1,2,4-Triazole) on the activity of urease and to overcome\
    \ the loss of nitrogen. For this purpose, soil samples were collected from three\
    \ different districts of Punjab i.e. Faisalabad, Sheikhupura and Gujranwala. The\
    \ whole work was divided into two phases. During phase \u2160, the effect of different\
    \ inhibitors on the activity of urease was determined. Kinetic behavior of urease\
    \ enzyme in the presence and absence of urease inhibitors was evaluated in phase\
    \ \u2161. The data acquired was statistically analyzed by using two-way ANOVA.\
    \ Kinetic study of urease enzyme was carried out to evaluate the effect of temperature,\
    \ pH, incubation time and substrate concentration on the activity of enzyme."
