  title: Temporal and Cultivar-Specific Effects on Potato Root and Soil Fungal Diversity
  abstract: The soil fungal community plays an important role in determining plant
    growth and health. In this study, we investigated the fungal diversity and community
    composition in the root and soil of 21 potato (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em> L.)
    cultivars using high-throughput sequencing at three different time points across
    the growing season. In soil and roots, the fungal richness and relative abundance
    of pathogens and saprotrophs were mainly affected by sampling time. While sampling
    time affected fungal composition in soil, root fungal communities were also significantly
    affected by cultivar. The cultivar had the strongest effect on diversity of pathogens
    and abundance of particular pathogen species. Our results demonstrate changes
    in soil and root fungal communities of potato over the growing season, as well
    as highlighting the importance of potato cultivar on root fungal communities and
    abundance of pathogens. This work was funded by the European Commission Horizon
    2020 project SoildiverAgro [grant agreement 817819].
