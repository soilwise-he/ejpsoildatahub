  title: Application Of Particle Image Velocimetry In The Analysis Of Scale Effects
    In Granular Soil
  abstract: "The available studies in the literature which dealt with the scale effects\
    \ of strip footings on different sand packing systematically still remain scarce.\
    \ In this research, the variation of ultimate bearing capacity and deformation\
    \ pattern of soil beneath strip footings of different widths under plane-strain\
    \ condition on the surface of loose, medium-dense and dense sand have been systematically\
    \ studied using experimental and noninvasive methods for measuring microscopic\
    \ deformations. The presented analyses are based on model scale compression test\
    \ analysed using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. Upper bound analysis\
    \ of the current study shows that the maximum vertical displacement of the sand\
    \ under the ultimate load increases for an increase in the width of footing, but\
    \ at a decreasing rate with relative density of sand, whereas the relative vertical\
    \ displacement in the sand decreases for an increase in the width of the footing.\
    \ A well agreement is observed between experimental results for different footing\
    \ widths and relative densities. The experimental analyses have shown that there\
    \ exists pronounced scale effect for strip surface footing. The bearing capacity\
    \ factors <em>N\u03B3</em> rapidly decrease up to footing widths <em>B</em>=0.25\
    \ m, 0.35 m, and 0.65 m for loose, medium-dense and dense sand respectively, after\
    \ that there is no significant decrease in <em>N\u03B3</em>. The deformation modes\
    \ of the soil as well as the ultimate bearing capacity values have been affected\
    \ by the footing widths. The obtained results could be used to improve settlement\
    \ calculation of the foundation interacting with granular soil."
