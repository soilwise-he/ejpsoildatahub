  title: Characteristics of Shallow Foundation Carrying Capacity Geotextile Reinforcement
    Interaction and Soil Density Level
  abstract: Geosynthetics use in earthworks has been widely accepted as an additional
    material to strengthen unstable soil-structures. Geosynthetics are a promising
    alternative to be used for repairs, accelerations, savings in construction related
    to soil, as if geosynthetics are a "magic pill" that can solve all geotechnical
    problems instantly. One form of geosynthetic is geotextile as a reinforcement
    and holding the ground. This study aims to analyze the effect of length (Bq),
    depth (d) and distance configuration (h) of each geotextile layer on variations
    in loading (q) and density variations that provide maximum carrying capacity.
    The research was testing the physical model in the laboratory, this test was carried
    out with and without geotextile reinforcement on soil media. Examin[ation and
    characteristic checks are carried out in the Soil Mechanics Laboratory of the
    Civil Engineering Department. The results show that the placement of geotextile
    layers can contribute to changing the mechanical characteristics of the reinforced
    soil, more optimal L/B distance and closer h/B distance, this increases the carrying
    capacity of the soil under shallow foundations and reduces the settlement that
    occurs (higher carrying capacity
