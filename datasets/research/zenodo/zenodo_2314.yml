  title: The influence of mowing regime on the soil seed bank of the invasive plant
    Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;\n          \n            Ambrosia artemisiifolia\n        \
    \   is an invasive annual herb infamous for the high allergenicity of its pollen,\
    \ which is related to increasing medical costs. Additionally, it can cause serious\
    \ yield losses as agricultural weed. Common ragweed seeds accumulate in the soil\
    \ and can remain therein viable for decades, which poses a problem for the sustainable\
    \ management of these populations. A long term management should thus target a\
    \ reduction of the soil seed bank. We observed the influence of four different\
    \ mowing regimes on the ragweed soil seed bank at six roadside populations in\
    \ eastern Austria. The mowing regimes were based on methods from common roadside\
    \ management practice and specifically adapted to reduce seed production. After\
    \ three years of application, the soil seed bank was indeed reduced by 45 to 80\
    \ percent through three of the four mowing regimes tested. Therefore, we suggest\
    \ that the best mowing regime for the most effective reduction of the size of\
    \ the soil seed bank is the one consisting of one cut just after the beginning\
    \ of female flowering (around the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week of August in\
    \ Eastern Central Europe), followed by a second cut 2\u20133 weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;"
