  title: Effect of Soil Toxicity on the Growth and Development of Crimson Clover (Trifolium
    incarnatum L.) and Blue Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)
  abstract: A vegetation trial was conducted to test, establish and compare the abilities
    of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) and blue alfalfa (Medicago sativa
    L.) to grow, sequester arsenic and improve microbial soil status in soils with
    deteriorated water and physical properties and with naturally and technogenically
    reached toxic levels of arsenic. The experiment is based on cultivation of two
    types of legume crops under the same controlled climatic conditions, but in different
    soil environments. Contaminated Regosols and control uncontaminated Rhodic Cambisols,
    ChromicCalcaric Cambisols and Fluvisols, collected from four geographical points,
    distributed (4 kg.) in a total of 24 pots/samples and sown with the two investigated
    crops (2x12) were included in the study. Crop growth and development were monitored
    during the vegetative and reproductive phenological phases, taking timely biometric
    measurements. According to the observations made and the results obtained, the
    crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) is suitable for remediation and improvement
    of the agrochemical, biological, physical and physicochemical properties of arsenic-contaminated
    soils - Regosols, by forming a dense root system with a relative abundance of
    tubers of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in it, in conditions of Interventional
    contents of arsenic, significant compaction and deteriorated water permeability
    of the soils. Contamination with arsenic (in association with a number of heavy
    metals) suppresses the germination of both crops - crimson clover and alfalfa,
    vegetative phenophases, nutrition, growth and development of clover, but not the
    fertility of the obtained crop of the studied crops. The main factors limiting
    the fertility of the two crops in the experiment were the low content of soil
    colloids (humus and clay) and the poorer soil microbiome. The observed better
    adaptability in feeding alfalfa in contaminated soils allows this crop to be applied
    in longer-term remediation measures.
