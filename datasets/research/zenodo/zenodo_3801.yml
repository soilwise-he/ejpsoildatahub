  title: Simulating Climate Change (Temperature And Soil Moisture) In A Mixed-Deciduous
    Forest, Ontario, Canada
  abstract: "To simulate expected climate change, we implemented a two-factor (temperature\
    \ and soil moisture) field design in a forest in Ontario, Canada. To manipulate\
    \ moisture input, we erected rain-exclusion structures. Under each structure,\
    \ plots were watered with one of three treatments and thermally controlled with\
    \ three heat treatments to simulate changes in air temperature and rainfall based\
    \ on the climate model (GCM) predictions for the study area. Environmental conditions\
    \ (including untreated controls) were monitored tracking air temperature, soil\
    \ temperature, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation. We measured\
    \ rainfall and relative humidity at the site outside the rain-exclusion structures.\
    \ Analyses of environmental conditions demonstrates that the temperature manipulation\
    \ was most effective at maintaining target temperature during the early part of\
    \ the growing season, but it was more difficult to keep the warmest treatment\
    \ at 5\xBA C above ambient by late summer. Target moisture regimes were generally\
    \ achieved however incoming solar radiation was slightly attenuated by the structures."
