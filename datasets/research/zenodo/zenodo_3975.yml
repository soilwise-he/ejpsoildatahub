  title: Effects Of Reclaimed Agro-Industrial Wastewater For Long-Term Irrigation
    Of Herbaceous Crops On Soil Chemical Properties
  abstract: "Worldwide, about two-thirds of industrial and domestic wastewater effluent\
    \ is discharged without treatment, which can cause contamination and eutrophication\
    \ of the water. In particular, for Mediterranean countries, irrigation with treated\
    \ wastewater would mitigate the water stress and support the agricultural sector.\
    \ Changing global weather patterns will make the situation worse, due to increased\
    \ susceptibility to drought, which can cause major environmental, social, and\
    \ economic problems. The study was carried out in open field in an intensive agricultural\
    \ area of the Apulian region in Southern Italy where freshwater resources are\
    \ often scarce. As well as providing a water resource, irrigation with treated\
    \ wastewater represents a significant source of nutrients for soil\u2013plant\
    \ systems. However, the use of wastewater might have further effects on soil.\
    \ This study thus investigated the long-term impact of irrigation with reclaimed\
    \ agro-industrial wastewater on the chemical characteristics of the soil. Two\
    \ crops (processing tomato and broccoli) were cultivated in succession in Stornarella\
    \ (Foggia) over four years from 2012 to 2016 using two types of irrigation water:\
    \ groundwater and tertiary treated agro-industrial wastewater that had undergone\
    \ an activated sludge process, sedimentation filtration, and UV radiation. Chemical\
    \ analyses were performed on the irrigation waters and soil samples. The treated\
    \ wastewater was characterised by high levels of several chemical parameters including\
    \ TSS, EC, COD, BOD<sub>5</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>,\
    \ NH<sub>4</sub>-N, PO<sub>4</sub>-P, K<sup>+</sup>, SAR and CaCO<sub>3</sub>,\
    \ as compared with the groundwater. However, despite these higher levels, the\
    \ mean content of several chemical parameters in the soil did not show relevant\
    \ differences between the irrigation treatments, in terms of the chemical features\
    \ of the soil."
