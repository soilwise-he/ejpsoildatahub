  title: Bioremediation Of Mechanic Workshop Polluted Soil Amended With Poultry Litter
  abstract: "This study focused on the use of 40% w/w poultry litter to remedy soil\
    \ polluted with spent oil released to the environment in mechanic workshops. Soil\
    \ samples were obtained in pots, treated with poultry litter and observed for\
    \ a period of 56 days. Pots A and B served as unpolluted and polluted control\
    \ while pot C served as the polluted sample that was amended. The bacterial count\
    \ ranged from 6.3 \xD7 10<sup>3 </sup>to 6.8 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/g in unpolluted\
    \ soil (US), 8.0 \xD7 10<sup>3</sup> to 9.8 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/g in mechanic\
    \ workshop soil (MS) and 1.72 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> to 1.80 \xD7 10<sup>5</sup>\
    \ cfu/g mechanic workshop soil amended with poultry litter (MSAP). Fungi counts\
    \ ranged from 2.5 \xD7 10<sup>3</sup> to 3.0 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/g in US,\
    \ 2.8 \xD7 10<sup>3 </sup>to 4.0 \xD7 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/g in MS, and 9.2 \xD7\
    \ 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.68 \xD7 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/g in MSAP. There were no significant\
    \ differences in the bacteria and fungi counts at 5% probability level. Bacteria\
    \ genera that were commonly isolated from the samples include <em>Bacillus sp,\
    \ Pseudomonas sp, Micrococcus sp, Staphylococcus sp, </em>and <em>Proteus sp.\
    \ </em>while fungi genera include <em>Aspergillus sp., Mucor sp. </em>and<em>\
    \ Saccharomyces sp</em>. There were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in\
    \ pH, moisture, nitrogen, organic carbon and electrical conductivity. However,\
    \ significant differences were observed in organic matter and phosphorus between\
    \ the treatments (US, MS, MSAP) at 5% probability level. The results of this work\
    \ strongly support the use of poultry litter in reclaiming hydrocarbon polluted\
    \ soil."
