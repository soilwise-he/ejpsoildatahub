  title: Liquid-liquid extraction of rare earth elements (total) using 2,3-dihydroxy-naphthalene
    as an extractant and its applications to the determination of REEs (total) in
    rock, soil and sediment samples by spectrophotometry
  abstract: "Chemistry Laboratory, Regional Center for Exploration and Research, Atomic\
    \ Minerals Directorate, Eastern Region, AMD Complex, Khasmahal, Jamshedpur-831\
    \ 002, Jharkhand, India <em>E-mail</em> : ptarafder@sify.com National Metallurgical\
    \ Laboratory, Burmamines, Jamshedpur-831 007, Jharkhand, India A simple and rapid\
    \ separation procedure for the determination of total rare earth elements (lanthanides)\
    \ including yttrium in geological samples such as rock, soil and sediments has\
    \ been developed. Lanthanides form 1 : 3 complex with O-O<em>'</em> type hi-dentate\
    \ ligand, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (2,3-H<sub>2</sub>ND) and are extracted in\
    \ the ethyl acetate from aqueous solution at pH &gt;8. Lanthanides from (lrganic\
    \ phase are quantitatively and selectively stripped off at pH 6.3 \xB1 0.2 followed\
    \ by its spectrophotometric determination using arsenazo-III. The effects of different\
    \ experimental parameters such as pH of aqueous solution, concentration of 2,3-H<sub>2</sub>ND,\
    \ electrolytes, equilibrium time, stripping agents, diverse ions etc. on the quantitative\
    \ recoveries of lanthanides were studied in detail. The percentage recovery was\
    \ checked by analyzing lanthanides in synthetic mixtures and it was found that\
    \ more than 98% recovery of lanthanides was obtained by this method. The accuracy\
    \ of the method was ascertained by analyzing some Certified Reference Materials\
    \ (CRM) like syenite sample (SY/3) and gabro sample (MRG-1). The lanthanide values\
    \ obtained for the CRMs were in excellent agreement with the recommended values,\
    \ indicating that the method yields fairly accurate and the reproducible results\
    \ as characterized by a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1 to 5% (n = 4).\
    \ The method was successfully applied to silicate rock, soil and sediment samples."
