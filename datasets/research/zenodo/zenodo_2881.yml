  title: Understory Evolution Related to Organic Fertilization in a Silvopastoral
    System Established under Pinus Radiata D. Don. In an Acidic Soil
  abstract: Mixed pasture establishment is considered as a key point to increase livestock
    production due to the higher quality it has compared with unmanaged shrubby species.
    They also provide a set of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and
    higher biodiversity. Moreover, herbaceous pasture establishment effectively contributes
    to biomass production while replacing shrubs therefore reducing forest fire risk.
    Two of the main factors promoting the establishment of the herbaceous pasture
    are sowing and fertilisation. This study evaluates the understory composition
    evolution of a silvopastoral system established with cocksfoot and clover in an
    acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don with four treatments that consist
    of no fertilization, fertilization with mineral fertilizers (500 kg of mineral
    8:24:16) and fertilization with three doses of sewage sludge (160, 320 and 480
    kg N ha-1), in Galicia (NW Spain). Botanical composition data were analysed through
    species abundance diagrams in a time window of 20 years. Results showed a clear
    evolution in understory composition from the initial situation. Organic fertilization
    was found to ease sown-mixture persistence on time as well as avoiding shrub colonisation
    with regard to mineral and no fertilization treatments. Nutritional and sun light
    high-demanding species were mostly replaced in favour of autochthonous ones after
    sewage sludge fertilization stopped and tree canopy intercepted light that reached
    the understory.
