  title: Impact of environmental and soil factors in the prediction of soil carbon
    dioxide emissions under different tillage systems
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Understanding the roles of natural drivers in greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions of arable fields is crucial for adequate agricultural management.
    This study investigated the combined effect of two tillage treatments (NT - no-tillage;
    CT - tillage with mouldboard ploughing) and environmental (air pressure, air temperature)
    and soil factors (total organic carbon, gravimetric water content and soil penetration
    resistance) on soil carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions in maize
    in 2020 and 2021. The soil tubes required for the laboratory measurement were
    derived from three different altitudes of the two differently cultivated fields
    from Fej&eacute;r county, Hungary. The typical soil type was Chernozem in both
    fields. At the time of soil sampling, soil penetration resistance was measured
    with a 06.15SA Penetrologger in 10 repetitions. To preserve the moisture content
    of the soil columns during the investigation, moisture replenishment was performed
    equal to the degree of weekly theoretical evapotranspiration. Emissions measurements
    of soil columns were performed by close chamber technique for five weeks from
    sampling, 15 times, in 3 repetitions in laboratory conditions. The data were evaluated
    by two-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey HSD multiple comparison test and two-tailed
    Student&rsquo;s T-test at a significance level of p&lt;0.05. The combined effect
    of environmental factors on soil carbon dioxide emissions was investigated using
    stepwise multiple linear regression. It has been proved that the observed difference
    between soil penetration resistance and soil carbon dioxide emissions was significant
    between CT and NT cultivation at different stages of the growing season. The analysis
    of the interaction of the experimental factors revealed that the combined effect
    of soil penetration resistance, total organic carbon and moisture content in tillage
    system (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.92 at a significance level of p=0.05)
    in 2020, while the combined effect of moisture content and air temperature in
    the no-tillage system (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.79 at a significance
    level of p=0.085) has the most significant effect on soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    emissions in 2020. In 2021, the air temperature for the tillage system (adjusted
    R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.74 at a significance level of p=0.05) and the combined
    effect of air temperature and pressure for no-tillage systems (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.69
    at a significance level of p=0.1) played an important role in soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    emissions. These observations highlight that different soil and environmental
    factors of different tillage significantly impact the soil carbon dioxide emissions
    in different years.&lt;/p&gt;'
