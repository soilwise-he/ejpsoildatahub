  abstract: This article 'Effect of Soil Salinity on Yield of Genotypes in Kanpur'
    appeared in the International Rice Research Newsletter series, created by the
    International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The primary objective of this publication
    was to expedite communication among scientists concerned with the development
    of improved technology for rice and for rice based cropping systems. This publication
    will report what scientists are doing to increase the production of rice in as
    much as this crop feeds the most densely populated and land scarce nations in
