  title: Comparative Cost Analysis of Pile Foundation with Soil Improvemnet of a Reclaimed
    Area
  abstract: Soil liquefaction is the most hazardous phenomenon for buildings, highways,
    railways and other structures in recent past years. Liquefaction of soil followed
    by earthquakes has always been a source of danger for the people living in the
    highly vulnerable seismic zones of the world. Dhaka city is expanding rapidly
    on reclaimed land due to rapid increase of population. The behavior of piles in
    reclaimed areas is significantly affected if the soil liquefies. Therefore, soil
    improvement is necessary. This paper discusses the variation of cost of piles
    of a reclaimed area with and without considering soil improvement technique like
    sand compaction pile and stone column. Cost analysis of sand compaction pile and
    stone column with different properties, i.e. diameter of the pile, Fineness modulus
    (FM) is also estimated in the context of Bangladesh. Sand Compaction pile is only
    1.3% to 2.1% of pile cost. On the other hand, stone column is more than 50% of
    RCC pile. Sand compaction pile is more cheaper than stone columns. The cost of
    sand compaction pile, for 1000 m2 area with FM 1.8 and fill volume 0.15 cum/m
    are 3.2 lac, 3.1 lac and 2.8 lac for diameter 200 mm, 250mm and 300 mm respectively.
