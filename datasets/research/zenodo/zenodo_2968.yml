  title: ISOLATION, MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF DIAZOTROPIC BACTERIA FROM VIRGIN
    SOIL FROM ARAKU VALLEY AND ASSESSMENT OF OF AMMONIA ACCUMULATION AT SALINE CONDITIONS
  abstract: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are widely distributed in nature where they reduce
    atmospheric nitrogen in soil or in association with plant. They have been found
    in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats in both temperate and tropical
    regions of the word. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are found in symbiotic associations
    with plants free living in soil. The objective of the present research was to
    isolate free living Nitrogen fixing bacteria from virgin soil samples in araku
    valley and assessment of their ammonia accumulation at saline conditions. 10 soil
    samples were collected in different place from virgin areas. For isolation of
    the free living nitrogen fixing bacteria, Nitrogen free media like Jensens Medium
    and Azotobacter Agar were used. Serially diluted soil samples were spread on the
    agar media and incubated for 48 hours. Eleven morphologically different bacteria
    were separated on made pure colonies on nutrient agar media. All bacteria were
    under go biochemical characterization which reveals that all these bacteria related
    to Azospirillum, Azotobacter and Clostridium. High ammonia liberating isolate
    MGN-10 was molecular characterizes as Azotobacter chroococcum and this soil application
    increase the plant growth in terms of growth parameters.
