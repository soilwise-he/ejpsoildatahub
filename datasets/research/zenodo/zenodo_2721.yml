  title: Mycorrhizal Status of Several Plants and Soil Characteristics Around the
    Poboya Gold Mining Area, Palu City, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia
  abstract: <em>In Central Sulawesi Province, there are 26 conservation areas in the
    form of National Parks, Nature Reserves, Grand Forest Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries,
    Nature Parks, Marine Parks and Hunting Parks spread throughout the Regency. However,
    at present, the conservation area is threatened by both legal and illegal mining
    activities, such as gold and nickel mining, which of course threatens the sustainability
    of these biological resources and land. The research was conducted around gold
    mining area, Poboya village, Palu Municipality, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The
    mining area is part of the Poboya Forest Park (Tahura), which is one of the important
    conservation areas in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This study aims to determine
    mycorrhizal status of several plant species and soil characteristics around the
    gold mining area of Poboya. The results showed that there were 33 types of local
    plants found in the gold mining area of Poboya Village, Palu, Central Sulawesi.
    Types of Acacia nilotica and Senna siamea are the most dominant plant species
    compared to other plant species. The highest percentage of Arbuscular mycorrhizal
    fungi colonization was found in Tectona grandis L., which was 67.6% and the lowest
    was in Opuntia sp, which was 2.3% and several plant species were not colonized
    on the roots such as Imperata cylindrical, Cyperus rotundus, Piper aduncum and
    Corypha sp. This study will allow us to know the mycorrhizal status of plants
    in the Poboya gold mining area, Central Sulawesi, in order to be used in the post-mining
    land reclamation process in the future.</em>
