  title: Functional diversity of experimental annual plant assemblages drives plant
    responses to biological soil crusts in gypsum systems
  abstract: '&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Biological soil crusts (BSC) are complex biotic aggregates comprised
    of lichens, cyanobacteria, algae and other micro-organism&nbsp;that are known
    to differently affect&nbsp;plant development along life cycle by selecting plant
    functional traits based&nbsp;on species-specific&nbsp;effects. In addition, functional
    differences between interacting&lt;br&gt;species should modulate their response
    ability to other environmental&nbsp;factors. Thus, it should be expected that
    the effects of the BSC on plants will be&nbsp;significantly determined by the
    own functional diversity in the community.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;To understand the multiple effects of BSC and the extent to which the
    functional&nbsp;diversity of interacting plant species can modulate their effects
    on the&nbsp;development of coexisting species, we applied an experimental approach
    by&nbsp;manipulating the initial functional diversity of the entire annual plant
    community&nbsp;and BSC conditions in a common garden trial. We crossed three sorts
    of&nbsp;assemblages built on the basis of plant stature (combinations of only
    large, or&nbsp;only small, or diverse sized plant species in pots) with three
    lichen-dominated&nbsp;BSC disturbance scenarios (intact, or tiny mechanically
    disaggregated, or absent&nbsp;portions of BSC).&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;BSC strongly affected the establishment and development of gypsophilous
    annual&nbsp;plants in a complex, multifaceted manner, which shifted throughout
    the&nbsp;plant life cycle. We demonstrated that lichen-dominated&nbsp;BSC could
    act as a&nbsp;major physical barrier to the establishment of annual plants at
    a heterogeneous&nbsp;fine spatial scale. Such a restrictive effect was particularly
    marked in the&nbsp;presence of intact BSC. However, after annual plants overcame
    the restrictions&nbsp;imposed by BSC, the same biotic layer facilitated plant
    growth and fitness, regardless&nbsp;of its physical integrity, resulting in larger
    plants producing more fruits.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Importantly, our results suggest that the functional diversity structure
    of the&nbsp;community may also drive growth and fitness of coexisting species
    by activating&nbsp;alternative coexistence mechanisms such as niche partitioning
    or competition&nbsp;symmetry. This study highlights the importance of plant neighbourhood
    features for the performance of interacting species, and confirms a novel, experimental&nbsp;way
    to explore the effects of community diversity on plants for the&nbsp;interpretation
    of assembly mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
