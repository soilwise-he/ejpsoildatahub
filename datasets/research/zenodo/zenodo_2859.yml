  title: Review of ecological risk assessment of contaminated soil through polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons in the Western and Central Region of Kenya
  abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most harmful pollutants
    to the atmosphere globally. This article reviews the ecological risk posed by
    PAHs by gathering information from soils in Kenya's Western and Central Regions
    (WCR) by analyzing their possible sources and ecological risks in soil, and suggesting
    remedial methods to address them. 29 studies on PAH pollution in Kenyan soils
    were located identified. The results show that the main causes of PAHs in soil
    in these areas were pyrolytic. About 70% of the total PAHs in the soil were LMW-PAHs,
    which shows that most of the PAHs in the WCR in Kenyan soil came from natural
    PAHs made by burning plants or volcanic eruptions. The highest total PAH level
    in soil was 63.8 ng g-1. The contamination of WCR soils with naphthylene may pose
    some ecological risks that need to be checked further. Kenya still tends to prefer
    the recommended strategies of incineration and bioremediation due to its cost-effectiveness.
    More detailed studies should be performed to get a better idea of where PAHs are
    found in order to prevent the severe contamination in the soil of Kenya and Africa.
