  title: 'BioPET: dedicated plant and soil micro-organism positron emission tomography
    system'
  abstract: The Nuclear Imaging Detector Development group at the Department of Physics,
    University of Regina is developing Canada's first positron emission tomography
    (PET) system for plant physiological function studies In its current configuration
    the system consists<br> of four detectors heads, each with active area of 48x48
    mm2 In a typical arrangement the four detectors are grouped in two pairs of opposing
    heads for detecting coincident events from positron annihilation, however the
    system geometry, data acquisition and image reconstruction are flexible and can
    be easily reconfigured on-demand to accommodate other scanner configurations The
    detector pairs can be scanned along the vertical axis allowing to image plants
    up to 50 cm tall, while the plant within the Field of View (FOV) of the scanner
    can be rotated on a precision controlled motorized platform to provide a complete
    3D coverage of the plant Current development and characterization of the plant
    PET system will be presented.
