  title: Vegetation effects on soil moisture estimation
  abstract: Several successful algorithms have been developed to estimate soil moisture
    of bare surfaces. We previously reported a new algorithm using the tilted Bragg
    approximation. However, these algorithms are only applicable to bare surfaces.
    When vegetation is present, soil moisture is typically underestimated by bare
    surface algorithms. In order to derive soil moisture under vegetation, we have
    to understand the complex scattering process due to vegetation. Our main interest
    is to retrieve the global soil moisture information using Hydros L-band polarimetric
    radar data. The Hydros mission will provide the first global view of land soil
    moisture using L-band radar and radiometer. The unique characteristics of the
    Hydros data are the availability of the low resolution soil moisture information
    from radiometer data and the continuous time series radar data collected at the
    same incidence angle. In this paper, we will examine a potential inversion algorithm
    to retrieve soil moisture under vegetation canopies using Hydros L-band polarimetric
    radar data
