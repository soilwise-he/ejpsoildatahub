  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;A study on the impact of parent materials and land use on soil
    quality indicators in soils of Akwa Ibom State was conducted. The aim was to evaluate
    the impact of parent materials and land use systems on soil quality indicators.
    Three parent materials (coastal plain sand, sandstone/shale, and beach ridge sand)
    and three land use types (cultivated land, fallow land of 3&ndash;5 years, and
    oil palm plantation) were selected for the study. In each land use type per parent
    material, six composite soil samples were collected from the representative location
    within the three land use types using soil auger within 0&ndash;30 cm soil depth.
    Undisturbed core samples were also collected for bulk density and saturated hydraulic
    conductivity determinations. A total of 52 soil samples were generated for laboratory
    analysis. Results showed that among the parent materials, coastal plain sand soil
    had the highest silt + clay fraction, organic matter, total N, available P, and
    exchangeable K, followed by sandstone/shale while beach ridge sand soil had the
    least. Among the land use types, oil palm plantation had the highest silt + clay
    fraction, organic matter, exchangeable Ca and K, followed by fallow land while
    cultivated land had the least. The combination of parent material and land use
    indicated that cultivated, fallow and oil palm plantation of coastal plain sand
    soils had the highest water and nutrient holding capacity, high rooting volume,
    good aeration status, less erosion threat, higher exchange sites, more available
    nutrients for plant uptake, more biological activity, etc., followed by sandstone/shale
    while beach ridge sand had the least in the study area. The application of more
    organic and less inorganic fertilizers will improve the soil quality of the study
    area.&lt;/p&gt;'
