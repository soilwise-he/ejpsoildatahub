  title: Biochar and water salinity impacts on soil physico-chemical properties and
    yield of Boro rice in the coastal saline area of the Ganges Delta
  abstract: Soil salinity is one of the major threats to crop production in the coastal
    saline areas of the Ganges delta. High amounts of soluble salts in soil adversely
    affect plant growth during the dry season. Soil amendments with biochar can be
    used to minimize soil salinity by improving soil properties and enhancing rice
    production. Field experiments were conducted in saline clay-textured soil to investigate
    the rice growth and yield, and soil properties in response to saline irrigation
    water with biochar amendment in 2021-22 and 2022-23 growing seasons. The treatments
    were five rates of biochar prepared from empty rice (0,2,3,4 and 6 t ha-1) and
    three levels of saline water irrigation (4,8 and 12 dS m-1) with three replications.
    A salt-tolerant medium growth duration (140-145 days) rice variety was used as
    a test variety. The higher rates of biochar (4 and 6 t ha-1) significantly increased
    yield of rice. Higher levels of water salinity (12 and 8 dS m-1) reduced rice
    yield by 50-56% (3.4-2.5 t ha-1) and 21-30% (5.4-4.0 t h-1) compared to lower
    level of water salinity (4 dS m-1) (6.8-5.7 t ha-1). Increasing salinity level
    significantly affected filled and unfilled grain, tiller per hill and plant height.
    However, the interaction of biochar and saline water had no effect on yield. Biochar
    maintained a lower level of soil salinity (EC1:5), and increased soil organic
    carbon and soil porosity but had no effect on extractable Na+, K+, and Ca++ ions.
    It indicates that higher biochar does improve rice yield but biochar amendment
    with increasing water salinity may not be sufficient to overcome salinity stress
    in the saltaffected soil.
