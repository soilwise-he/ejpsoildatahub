  title: Fermentation Strategies to Improve Soil Bio-Inoculant Production and Quality
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The application of plant beneficial microorganisms has been
    widely accepted as an efficient alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
    Isolation and selection of efficient microorganisms, their characterization and
    testing in soil-plant systems are well studied. However, the production stage
    and formulation of the final products are not in the focus of the research, which
    affects the achievement of stable and consistent results in the field. Recent
    analysis of the field of plant beneficial microorganisms suggests a more integrated
    view on soil inoculants with a special emphasis on the inoculant production process,
    including fermentation, formulation, processes, and additives. This mini-review
    describes the different groups of fermentation processes and their characteristics,
    bearing in mind different factors, both nutritional and operational, which affect
    the biomass/spores yield and microbial metabolite activity. The characteristics
    of the final products of fermentation process optimization strategies determine
    further steps of development of the microbial inoculants. Submerged liquid and
    solid-state fermentation processes, fed-batch operations, immobilized cell systems,
    and production of arbuscular mycorrhiza are presented and their advantages and
    disadvan- tages are discussed. Recommendations for further development of the
    fermentation strategies for biofertilizer production are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;
