  title: Review Paper on Properties of Black Cotton Soil using Marble Dust with Banana
    Fiber
  abstract: 'Soil is the indispensable element of this nature. It is attached to everyone
    in one or another way. All the basic amenities of life, whether it is concerned
    with food, clothes and house, have been fulfilled by the soil .Without the soil
    it is just next to impossible to think about life on this earth. The word "soil
    is derived from the Latin word solium which according to Webster''s dictionary
    means the upper layer of the earth that may be dug or plowed specifically, the
    loose surface material of earth in which plant grows. The term soil in soil engineering
    is defined as an unconsolidated material, composed of solid particles produced
    by disintegration of rocks. The voids space between particles may contain air,
    water or both. The solid particles may contain organic matter. The soil particles
    maybe separated by such mechanical means as agitation and water. Soil deposits
    in nature exist in an extremely erratic manner producing thereby an infinite variety
    of possible combination which will affect the strength of the soil and the procedures
    to make it purposeful. So is the particular case of black cotton soil with a wide
    range of challenges associated with the construction at sites with black cotton
    soil. In case of coarse grained soil, the mineralogical composition of the grain
    hardly affects the engineering properties of the soils perhaps the grain to grain
    friction is influenced Is such soils, inter particle forces other than those due
    to gravity are of no consequence, but the finer particles, the more significant
    becomes the forces associated with the surface area of the grains. Manish Saxena
