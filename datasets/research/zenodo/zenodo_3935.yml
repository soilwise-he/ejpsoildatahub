  title: ANTI - CANCER ENZYME(L - ASPARAGINASE) PRODUCTION, PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION
    FROM A SOIL ISOLATE OF PSEUDOMONAS SP
  abstract: 'L-Asparaginase or L-asparagine amido hydrolases are enzymes that catalyze
    the substrate hydrolysis of L-asparagine. It results in the formation of L-aspartate
    and ammonia. It has immense application in the treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia
    as an antineoplastic agent and also finds its use in food technology. Its vast
    application in the pharmaceutical industry has led to the need for more sources
    of production of L-asparaginase. The current work is focused on production, purification,
    and characterization of L-asparaginase. The enzyme is produced using the batch
    mode of cultivation with critical media components disodium phosphate (0.042M),
    sodium chloride (0.0854M) and Asparagine (0.060M) respectively. The extracellular
    L-asparaginase was later purified by the following techniques: salt dialysis,
    ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. Meanwhile, protein
    estimation was done using lowrys method. The molecular weight of the enzyme was
    found to be at 55KDa as revealed through SDS-PAGE. The biochemical analysis revealed
    that the species producing the enzyme belonged to Pseudomonas sp. The culture
    condition favoring the production of the enzyme L-asparaginase was found to be
    at a temperature of 400C, pH-9, and incubation time of 24hr. Optimization with
    critical carbon and nitrogen sources with varying concentrations disclosed sucrose
    and ammonium sulfate at 1.5%(w/w) to maximize the enzyme production. The purified
    enzyme was characterized by the above parameters (400C, pH-9) and incubation period
    of 40 minutes was found to be having an enzyme activity 434.10(U/ml). Additionally,
    to overproduce the enzyme, strain development was performed with the treatment
    of UV-B rays exposed at different heights and X-rays to yield more amount of enzyme.'
