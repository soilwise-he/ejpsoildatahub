  title: Isolation of antibiotics producing bacteria from marine soil and comparative
    analysis of same with commercially available drugs
  abstract: The isolation of antibiotic producing bacteria from marine soil and comparative
    analysis of same with ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin against <em>staphylococcus
    aureus </em>and <em>Escherichia coli </em>was carried out in a Microbiology Laboratory
    of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli. This was done to isolate antibiotic
    producing bacteria and compare same with existing commercially available antibiotics
    with a view to using marine soil in the treatment of common bacterial infections.
    Soil samples were collected from Bonny Island Sea, Port Harcourt. One gram of
    mixed soil sample was serially diluted and spread-plated on nutrient agar plates.
    The representative isolates obtained were sub-cultured to get a pure culture.
    Morphological, biochemical, physiological characteristics of the bacteria were
    analyzed. Agar well diffusion was carried out. One isolate had a substantial antibacterial
    activity with 3.5mm zone of inhibition against two test bacteria used in the preliminary
    screening. The isolate was marked as <em>Streptomyces </em>(STR I) and was identified
    as <em>Streptomyces griseus </em>while other isolates did not show any antibacterial
    activity. Ciprofloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity to both <em>Staphylococcus
    aureus </em>and<em> Escherichia coli </em>of 3.7mm and 4.0mm respectively while
    Amoxicillin showed antibacterial activity of 3.5mm and 2.7mm respectively. This
    reveals that antibiotic producing bacteria from marine soil are also effective
    in antimicrobial activity and could be used for antimicrobial chemotherapy.
