  title: 'Bioremediation of heavy metal ions from contaminated soil and water by microbes:
    A review'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Scientists all over the world are working tirelessly on the
    management of environmental toxicants and their control over the past two decades
    due to their injurious effects on plants, animals, and humans. These calcitrants
    released to the environment from both anthropogenic industries and natural sources
    can enter the food chain. The removal of such xenobiotic materials such as heavy
    metalsfrom the soil and water around industrial areas has received great attention
    nowadays globally. It is, therefore; against this backdrop that this review research
    was conducted solely to establish the potentials of microorganisms (algae, fungi,
    bacteria, and plants) in the bio-removal of heavy metals contaminated soils and
    water. The study revealed that the use of these microbes in the decontamination
    of the environment cannot be overemphasized hence cost-effective, eco-friendly,
    and available almost everywhere on planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;'
