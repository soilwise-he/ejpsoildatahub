  title: Soil Fertility Status Of Cassava Fields In South Western Nigeria
  abstract: "Aims: Current information on nutrient status of south western Nigeria\
    \ soils is needed to develop appropriate integrated nutrient management packages\
    \ for sustainable cassava production within the area. This study is designed to\
    \ provide information on fertility status of some soils of the area. Study Design:\
    \ A field survey. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in March\
    \ 2009 within two agro ecological zones of Osun state, south western Nigeria.\
    \ Methodology: A field survey of 33 farmers\u2019 fields in two agro ecological\
    \ zones of Osun state namely; Iwo zone and Oshogbo zone was undertaken. Representative\
    \ soil samples (0-20cm) were obtained from each field. Physical and chemical properties\
    \ of soil samples were determined in the laboratory following established methods.\
    \ Statistical analyses of soil data was carried out using appropriate techniques.\
    \ Results: The soils of the area are acidic (pH in water range: 5.4 -6.4) and\
    \ 79% of the fields are deficient in soil organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus\
    \ are below established critical limits for cassava production in half of the\
    \ fields; exchangeable cations (calcium, magnesium and potassium) are present\
    \ in adequate amounts in most soils. No significant differences (P .05) were observed\
    \ between the zones for soil properties measured. Conclusion: Farmer acceptable\
    \ strategies for improving nutrients availability (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus),\
    \ organic matter and overall soil health through use of fertilizers, organic materials\
    \ and multipurpose legumes among other options are required for sustained cassava\
    \ production."
