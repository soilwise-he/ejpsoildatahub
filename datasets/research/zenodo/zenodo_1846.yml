  abstract: "The aim of the study was to assess the influence of shelterbelts of poplar\
    \ clone Hybrid 275 [Populus (maximowiczii * trichocarpa) cv. Hybrid 275] on the\
    \ grain crops yield, availability of nutrients, and soil water storage. The studies\
    \ were conducted on three stands in northern Poland near Toru\u0144. The results\
    \ of the studies showed that poplar shelterbelts had negative impact on the grain\
    \ crops yield. A 46- 75% reduction of yield from fields located in the vicinity\
    \ of the poplars was observed in comparison to the maximum values noted at distances\
    \ of 30-40 m from the trees. The reason of the grain crops yield reduction in\
    \ the neighbourhood of poplars was the shortage of soil water, especially during\
    \ the period of grain florescence. A distinct positive effect of the poplar shelterbelts\
    \ on the content of organic carbon, total nitrogen and forms of nitrogen, phosphorus\
    \ and potassium available for plants was noted in the humic horizon of the soils."
