  title: Data on the influence of soil type on the non-linear seismic response of
    a corroded reinforced concrete portal frame
  abstract: The Excel file contains the results of a computer simulation of a reinforced
    concrete portal frame corroded at the ground floor columns by the ingress of chloride
    ions. This is a 3-storey portal frame subjected to earthquakes in two different
    ground conditions. The results concern the seismic analysis using the pushover
    method. The results obtained by the software are then grouped and presented graphically.
    In this way, the force at the base of the portal frame is shown as a variation
    of the displacement of the top of the terrace as a function of the age of the
    building. The inter-storey displacement and the ductility of the portal frame
    are determined.
