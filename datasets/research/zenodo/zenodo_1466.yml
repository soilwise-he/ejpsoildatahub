  title: Physicochemical Characteristics of the Soil on the Growth of Sal Forest in
    Jharkhand
  abstract: "The physicochemical characterization of soil on the growth of selected\
    \ Sal forest in Hazaribag, Chatra, Koderma, and Ranchi districts of Jharkhand\
    \ in India has been carried out. The paper describes the different basic factors\
    \ which support the growth of Saldominated forest found in these areas. The soil\
    \ sampling was done using a quadrate method based on the principle of systematic\
    \ sampling. Ten samples each were collected from Hazaribag, Chatra, Koderma, and\
    \ Ranchi Sal forests of Jharkhand for the study of soil properties. The soil samples\
    \ were collected from eight different quadrates in order to determine soil quality\
    \ index viz. soil texture, MC, WHC, OC, OM, pH, N, P, Na, K, and Ca. The soil\
    \ pH was found to be slightly acidic having a range of 5.40\u2013 5.99. Moisture\
    \ content, water-holding capacity, organic carbon, organic matter, and available\
    \ nitrogen of soil samples were found to be in the range of 3.70\u201311.30%,\
    \ 35.27\u201357.59%, 0.46\u20130.97%, 1.36\u20133.54%, 207\u2013314 Kg/ha, respectively.\
    \ P, Na, K was found to be in the range of 2.96-7.19 Kg/ha, 2.73-5.34, 154.56-\
    \ 471.38 Kg/ha and Ca in mg/kg was found to be 1712- 3144 respectively."
