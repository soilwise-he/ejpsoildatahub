  title: "Iron metabolism in soybean grown in calcareous soil is influenced by plant\
    \ growth-promoting rhizobacteria \xE2\u20AC\u201C A functional analysis"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency results in severe yield losses, particularly
    in calcareous soils. Recent evidences suggest that biofertilizers with plant growth-promoting
    rhizobacteria (PGPR) may be an efficient strategy for enhancing iron (Fe) nutrition
    in legumes. This work aimed at evaluating the capacity of PGPR strains to enhance
    Fe uptake-related processes in soybean grown in calcareous soil. From the studied
    24 PGPR,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sphingobium fuliginis&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;ZR 1&ndash;6 and&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas
    jessenni&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;ZR 3&ndash;8 strains were selected for the inoculation
    experiment based on their&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;ability to produce
    indole-3-acetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, siderophores,
    and organic acids, to tolerate high pH, and to reduce Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.
    The effect of bacterial inoculation on improving Fe uptake was tested using each
    isolate alone or combined and through the evaluation of several morphological,
    physiological, and molecular parameters. Inoculation with&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;S. fuliginis&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;showed
    beneficial effects particularly at the root level by the improvement of ferric
    chelate activity (111%) and FRO2 expression (646%), resulting in increased Fe
    root content (62%). Inoculation with&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P. jessenii&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;increased
    Zn and Mn concentrations in the trifoliates (463% and 51%, respectively), decreased
    Zn concentration in the roots (88%), and increased the expression of FER4 in the
    trifoliates (5260%). Combined inoculation of both strains fostered Fe accumulation
    in the trifoliates and increased the expression of IRT1 and FER4 genes, indicating
    an improved capacity of Fe translocation to the shoots. These results suggest
    that inoculation with selected PGPR strains could be effective in improving Fe
    uptake and accumulation in soybean grown under Fe-deficient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;'
