  title: Effect of Tillage Practices on Selected Soil Properties in Sudan Savanna
    Agro-Ecology of Nigeria
  abstract: "<strong>Abstract</strong><strong>\u2014</strong> Field experiments were\
    \ carried out in 2018 and 2019 cropping seasons to evaluate the effect of tillage\
    \ practices on selected soil properties in Sudan Savanna Agro-ecology of Nigeria.\
    \ Treatments consisted of zero tillage, flat beds and ridges, and were laid out\
    \ in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated three times. Prior\
    \ to experiment, surface (0-15 cm) soil samples were collected from eight points\
    \ and bulked; post-harvest composite soil samples were also collected on the basis\
    \ of treatments and were analyzed using standard analytical procedures. NCRIBEN-01M\
    \ variety of sesame was used as the test crop for both cropping seasons. The data\
    \ generated from the study were subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using\
    \ Genstat Release 10.3 DE after which significant means were separated using Least\
    \ Significant Difference (LSD) at 5 % level of probability. Based on the findings\
    \ of this study, there were significant effects of tillage practices with respect\
    \ to most soil parameters studied in 2018 and 2019 cropping seasons. The effects\
    \ of tillage practices on soil nutrients indicated that the zero tilled plots\
    \ had higher nutrients and organic matter, followed by the flat beds while the\
    \ ridged plots gave lower values for essential nutrients and organic matter in\
    \ both cropping seasons. For conservation or retention of essential nutrients\
    \ as well as organic matter in soil, zero tillage is recommended for the study\
    \ area."
