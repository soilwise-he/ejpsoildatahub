  title: Research Of The Relationship Between The Content Of Heavy Metals In Sediment
    Dust And Agricultural Soil In The Area Surrounding The Steelworks Zenica.
  abstract: "This paper contains analysis of the results after monitoring the content\
    \ of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr and Mn) in sediment dust and agricultural\
    \ soil in nine locations surrounding steelworks Zenica from March to August in\
    \ 2016. The aim of the paper is to analyze and assess connection of the content\
    \ of heavy metals in sediment dust and in soil surrounding steelworks Zenica in\
    \ order to rate soil contamination caused by heavy metals that have been emitted\
    \ from metallurgic plants, and in order to evaluate the industrial emissions effect\
    \ on the environment and human health. It has been established that the biggest\
    \ sample number of sediment dust is being loaded by Nickel and Cadmium, and soil\
    \ samples by Nickel and Manganese. By applying Pearson coefficient, it has been\
    \ concluded that there is a strong relation between Lead and Zinc, and a medium\
    \ strong relation between Iron in sediment dust and soil, while other analyzed\
    \ metals do not show significant correlation in terms of statistics. This shows\
    \ that Lead, Zinc and Iron in the soil are probably of techno-genic origin, and\
    \ the other metals are of primarily geological origin. The correlation analysis\
    \ of metal substance in soil and sediment dust in measuring areas has shown that\
    \ there is a statistically significant correlation between Zinc in sediment dust\
    \ and soil in the following areas: Gradi?\u0107e, Arnauti and Novo Selo, and correlation\
    \ of Chromium in sediment dust and soil is present in ?eri\u0107i."
