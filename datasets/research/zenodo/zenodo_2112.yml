  title: REMOVAL OF FLUORIDE FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTION USING FIRED CLAY SOIL PILLARED
    WITH TEA LEAF ASH COMPONENTS
  abstract: This study reports on the adsorption of fluoride ion from aqueous solutions
    by using fired clay soil, pillared with tea leave ash components. The potential
    of low cost material fired clay soil and fired clay soil pillared with tea leave
    ash components for fluoride removal from aqueous solution was evaluated by using
    fluoride ion selective electrode. Pillaring of clay soil with tea leave ash was
    done by thoroughly mixing fifteen gram of tea leave ash and three hundred gram
    of clay soil using distilled water and it was aged for 96 hours until it was dried.
    Untreated clay soil and clay soil pillared with tea leave ash components were
    fired in an electrical furnace at 570 C for 3 hrs. Batch adsorption experiments
    were carried out and the effects of pH, contact time, initial adsorbate concentration,
    adsorbent dose and temperature of the solution were investigated. Adsorption of
    fluoride by fired clay soil and fired clay soil pillared with tea leave ash was
    observed to sharply increase from pH 4 to 7 then decreased. The maximum adsorption
    efficiencies obtained were 75% for fired clay soil and 90% for fired clay soil
    pillared with tea leave ash components at pH 7 for both adsorbents. The maximum
    adsorption capacity obtained was 0.913 mg/g for fired clay soil and 2.746 mg/g
    for fired clay soil pillared with tea leave ash components. It can be concluded
    that fired clay soil pillared with tea leave ash is a good and cheap adsorbent
    with high potential for the adsorption and removal of fluoride from fluoride contaminated
    water and could therefore serve as effective and efficient adsorbent for treatment
    of drinking waters in terms of high adsorption capacity.
