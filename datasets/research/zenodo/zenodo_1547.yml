  title: "DYNAMICS OF SOIL USE AND COVERAGE FROM THE MUNICIPALITY OF SILV\xC2NIA (1985-2020)"
  abstract: "Research on land use and occupation has been effective for the recognition\
    \ of the municipalities and their main forms of surface occupation, because from\
    \ this appreciation, knowledge is provided in order to contribute to decision-making.\
    \ The municipality of Silv\xE2nia in the state of Goi\xE1s, Brazil, has historical\
    \ importance since the eighteenth century due to mining and later the influence\
    \ of the Green Revolution in Goi\xE1s, which supplies an important participation\
    \ in GDP. The aim of this article is to understand land use changes in Silv\xE2\
    nia between 1985 and 2020. The methodological procedures were based on mapping\
    \ with visual interpretation of images from MapBiomas Collection 6. The results\
    \ indicate that the main form of use features agriculture, which has already been\
    \ a characteristic of the municipality since the mapping of 1985 and expanded\
    \ over the years, resulting in conversion and fragmentation of native vegetation."
