  title: 'Evaluation of Heavy Metal Contamination of Soil from Petroleum Crude Oil
    at an Illegal Refinery Site: A Case Study of Oshika Community in the Niger Delta
    Region of Nigeria'
  abstract: "The study was carried out at Oshika community of Rivers State in the\
    \ Niger Delta region of Nigeria where petroleum crude oil illegal refining activity\
    \ was terminated. Soil samples were collected at two different points at depths\
    \ of 15 cm, 45 cm and 90 cm with a control for analysis of heavy metal pollutants\
    \ (Pb, Cd, Cr, As, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co). The results from the analysis show that all\
    \ the heavy metals investigated were present with their mean concentration values\
    \ for top soil as 56.48\xB10.01 mg/kg, 53.49\xB10.00 mg/kg. 53.49\xB10.00 mg/kg,\
    \ 84.75\xB10.01 mg/kg, 39.44\xB19.01 mg/kg, 35.46\xB10.00 mg/kg, 66.61\xB10.03\
    \ mg/kg and 40.66\xB10.00 mg/kg respectively which are all higher than the control\
    \ values. Contamination factor, pollution index and geo-accumulation index were\
    \ applied as index models for the evaluation of the extent and intensity of heavy\
    \ metal contamination and pollution of the illegal refining at the site. All the\
    \ index models used showed that the soil at the site was heavily contaminated\
    \ and polluted by Cd and As, while also the result of the soil from the analysis\
    \ indicated uncontaminated and unpolluted by Pb, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr and Zn. The toxicity\
    \ of these heavy metals and the adverse impact on the health of the community\
    \ cannot be over emphasized and the paper therefore advocated for discouraging\
    \ illegal refining and implementation of integration policy into the modular refinery\
    \ system."
