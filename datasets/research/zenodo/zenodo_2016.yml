  title: Soil Green Algae Of Classes Trebouxiophyceae, Charophyceae And Ulvophyceae
    Of Gomel Some Streets Roadside Lawns
  abstract: "In this article considers the results of the study the composition of\
    \ green algae classes Trebouxiophyceae, Charophyceae and Ulvophyceae of roadside\
    \ lawns of some streets of Gomel.\n\nResearch methods: field, laboratory and cultural.\n\
    \nTotal in the soils of the studied streets in the city of Gomel identified 27\
    \ species of green algae, belonging to 16 genera, 13 families, 9 orders of the\
    \ classes Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Charophyceae. Taxonomic analysis showed\
    \ the predominance Trebouxiophyceae (66.7%), were least represented Ulvophyceae\
    \ \u2014 3.7%. Among the families dominated Chlorellaceae \u2014 22.0%; Choricystidaceae\
    \ and Klebsormidiaceae amounted to 11,0%. Most of the families included the 1-2\
    \ species, indicating a simplified organization of algal communities. Ecological\
    \ analysis showed the predominance of soil algae \u041D\u2013 and Ch\u2013life\
    \ forms (50.0% and 40.9% respectively).\n\nTaxonomic and ecological analysis of\
    \ algal communities of the investigated soils is made. It is shown that the taxonomic\
    \ and ecological structure of green algae in soils of roadside lawns depends on\
    \ the degree of anthropogenic load.\n\nThe restructuring of the taxonomic structure\
    \ of algal communities with a change in the transport load. With the decrease\
    \ of the transport load in 2014 and 2015 years shows an increase in species richness\
    \ and expansion of the taxonomic diversity of green algae, 2016 year \u2014 in\
    \ the early stages, there has been an increase of species richness of algae classes\
    \ studied, followed by a slight decrease. With increasing distance from the roadway\
    \ identified the expansion of species richness of algae. In the ecological respect\
    \ the general patterns of algal community structure changes are noted with an\
    \ average transport load intensity, as the distance from the roadway increases,\
    \ the proportion of Ch\u2013form algae decreases and the number of representatives\
    \ of the H\u2013life form increases."
