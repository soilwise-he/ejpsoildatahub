  title: "Using bio-based fertilizer derived from peri\u2011urban wastes affects soil\
    \ properties and lettuce yield and quality"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The use of waste-derived fertilizers, also known as bio-based
    fertilizers (BBFs), for the production of ready-to-eat vegetables can efficiently
    contribute to sustainability and circularity. However, studies on the efficiency
    and safety of these fertilizers are needed. Thus, this study aimed to examine
    and characterize the effects of combined application of BBFs on lettuce yield
    and quality and soil properties in a trial conducted under open field conditions.
    The eight experimental treatments included green- or food waste compost combined
    with either human urine, food waste digestate or synthetic fertilizer and compared
    to treatments with synthetic fertilizer alone or in combination with manure. The
    control treatment received no BBF or other type of fertilizer. The results showed
    statistically similar fresh lettuce yields after 48 days among the treatments,
    all of which were larger than the yield of the unfertilized control treatment.
    The highest fresh yield (73 t ha&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was observed
    with the combination of manure and synthetic fertilizer. Yield in treatments that
    received green waste or food waste composts tended to decrease slightly, more
    likely due to nitrogen immobilization after the application of incompletely stabilized
    composts and the low initial mineral N. Nitrate contents in fresh lettuce leaves
    were below the EU limits (3000&nbsp;mg kg&lt;sup&gt;&minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in all
    the treatments. Analysis of pathogens and trace elements present in aboveground
    lettuce showed no significant risk. The application of BBFs also appeared to maintain
    the soil pH compared to synthetic fertilizer treatments. The important nutrient
    and carbon contents of BBFs and their positive effect on lettuce yield associated
    with their non-harmful impact on lettuce quality suggest that BBFs can be used
    for vegetable production and to increase the soil carbon stocks and contribute
    to city sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;'
