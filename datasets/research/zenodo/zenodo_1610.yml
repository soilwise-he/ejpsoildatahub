  title: "The effects of global change on soil faunal communities:\_a meta-analytic\
    \ approach"
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Human impacts are causing an unprecedented change of biodiversity\
    \ across scales. To quantify\_the nature and degree of the biodiversity change,\
    \ there have been a number of meta-analysis studies investigating the effects\
    \ of global change drivers (land use, climate, etc.). However, these studies include\
    \ few primary literature studies of soil biodiversity. Soil biodiversity is important\
    \ for a variety of ecosystem services that are critical for human wellbeing. Yet,\
    \ we know little about how soil organisms may respond to changing environmental\
    \ conditions. Although studies have investigated the impact of global change drivers\
    \ on soil biodiversity, they lack sufficient depth in the number of drivers and/or\
    \ taxa included. Additionally, the previous focus on aboveground organisms has\
    \ also resulted in a bias towards certain global change drivers in the primary\
    \ literature. For example, climate change and land use change are more often studied,\
    \ whilst pollution is typically understudied as a global change driver. Building\
    \ on previous studies, we will conduct a meta-analysis to compare the effects\
    \ of global change drivers (land use, habitat fragmentation/loss, fire, climate\
    \ change, invasive species, pollution,\_and nutrient enrichment) on soil fauna\
    \ (micro- to macro-invertebrates). This project aims to fill the current gaps\
    \ in the literature, and actively participate\_in incorporating soil biodiversity\
    \ into future global biodiversity assessments, by creating the first global open-acess\
    \ dataset on the impacts of multiple global change drivers on soil fauna.&lt;/p&gt;"
