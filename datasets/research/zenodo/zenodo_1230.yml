  title: NEW ASPECTS OF NITROGEN FIXATION AND CONSERVATION IN THE SOIL. PART II.
  abstract: Experiments have been made on soils after adding organic acids (both high
    and low carbon), oils like mahua, mustard and linseed and their effect on the
    fixation of nitrogen have been studied. Effects of canesugar, inulin, starch.
    cowdung and molasses in the nitrogen fixation in soil both in the artificial light
    and sunlight as well as in the dark have been investigated. Influence of temperature
    and light on nitrogen fixation has also been studied and the mechanism of nitrogen
    fixation with reference to energy change disclosed.
