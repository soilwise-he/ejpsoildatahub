  title: Soil fauna associated with different intensification levels in rice rotation
    systems of Uruguay.
  abstract: 'The soil fauna is composed of a large variety of organisms with different
    sizes and adaptive strategies that determine the way they influence soil processes.
    Given the role they play in soils, they are good indicators of soil conservation
    status. Abundance and presence parameters of soil fauna are used to assess soil
    health status. Rice is one of the main crops in Uruguay with an export-oriented
    production. Uruguayan rice agroecosystem was historically rotated with pastures
    and, more recently, with other crops like sorghum and soybean. Economic pressure
    due to the demand for food affects the farmer''s rotation design, increasing the
    frequency of rice or shortening the pasture phase in the rotation cycle. These
    processes of intensification impose soil changes that can affect the associated
    diversity. To know how these changes can affect the diversity and conservation
    of soil fauna we conducted a study in a long-term experiment on rice rotation
    systems in eastern Uruguay. The soil fauna composition was studied in four contrasting
    rotations: continuous rice (CR), rice and long pasture (RP), rice and short pasture
    (RSP), and rice and soybean (RS). Soil fauna was extracted from soil monoliths
    (0-10 and 10-20 cm) and pitfall traps during 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 during sowing
    and after harvest. The effects of rotation on the diversity, abundance, and functional
    groups of soil fauna were determined to infer the soil health status of each system.
    No major differences were found in the number of taxa among the rotations studied.
    The abundance of soil fauna decreased in the second season sampled in all rotations,
    which may be due to sensitivity crop intensification effects, such as phytosanitary
    products exposure and management practices, without ruling out the effects of
    sampling effort. Community composition showed that RSP and RS were the most similar
    in both years, pointing to an effect of similar fallow time between rice plantings.
    The similarity index showed that, although the abundance of the fauna was affected,
    a similar behavior was maintained in the two sampling years. This result may indicate
    a degree of adaptation of the organisms observed.'
