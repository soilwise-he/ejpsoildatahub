  abstract: "Livings Labs and Lighthouses are key to accelerating the adoption of\
    \ sustainable practices by users and developing solutions adapted to local conditions.\
    \ The factsheet <em>EU Soil Mission Living Labs and Lighthouses for Soil Health:\
    \ <strong>Agricultural Land Use </strong></em>is part of a series of five factsheets\
    \ which provide clear information on what the Living Labs and Lighthouses are\
    \ and their role in the EU Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019. The factsheet\
    \ \u201CFunding Opportunities\u201D provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of the types\
    \ of Living Labs, the criteria to identify the Lighthouses and the actions supporting\
    \ the development of the Living Labs across Europe. The other four factsheets\
    \ focus on each type of Living Lab that will be funded, which are categorised\
    \ under specific land use: Agricultural, Forestry, (Post)Industrial, Urban."
