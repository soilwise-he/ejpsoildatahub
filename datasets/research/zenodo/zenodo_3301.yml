  title: 'Experimenting Electrical Conductivity for Nourishing Soil: Highlighting
    The Process and Measurement of Soil Testing'
  abstract: Studying about Soil is a vital process during the course of seeding, yielding
    and harvesting. While this can be done through several process, it is important
    to adhere prominent standard of measuring the soil. The standard method for soil
    assessment is by laboratory method which is cumbersome and gives rise to limitations
    for data-intensive works. This research paper is an extract of experiment from
    young scientists who executed a process of assessing apparently through Electrical
    Conductivity (EC) in soil which entails to set a new standard. These are presented
    along with the means and modes of measurement process. Procedures to measure and
    mathematical calculations are sourced for this experiment. The owners of experiment
    were awarded for coining this idea, and later the abridged version of the experiment
    is drafted as a research paper herewith.
