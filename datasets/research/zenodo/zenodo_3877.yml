  title: Biochar and vermicompost soil amendments reduce root rot disease of common
    bean (Phaseolous Vulgaris L.)
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Common bean production is constrained by root rot complexes
    resulting to as much as 70% losses in Kenya. This study sought to establish the
    effect of soil amendments biochar and vermicompost on root rot fungal pathogens
    of commonbean in Western Kenya. Application of biochar, vermicompost and fertilizer
    were done in farmer fields in four agro ecological zones of Western Kenya prior
    to planting during the long rains of 2013 and 2014. No applications were done
    in the shot rains seasons of 2013 and 2014. Plant emergence and disease incidence
    was recorded in the field and disease severity determined in the laboratory. Isolation
    and identification of pathogens was done from treatment plots following a two
    weeks and six weeks sampling after planting. Pathogens isolated were identified
    using morphological characteristics. Soil amendments positively influenced plant
    emergence. Root rot disease incidence and severity was greatly reduced up to 40%
    and 60% every season respectively. Biochar and vermicompost treatments reduced
    the population of fungal pathogens and also influenced the populations of beneficial
    microorganisms such as &lt;em&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Paecilomyces
    lilacinus&lt;/em&gt;. Application of soil amendments increased yield by 46% and
    also soil pH and nutrients were increased. In conclusion treatment application
    of vermicompost and biochar reduce root rot disease and improve bean productivity.&lt;/p&gt;'
