  title: Force and Settlement Characteristics of an Embankment on Soft Consolidating
    Soil with Lime Columns
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Embankment supported on soft soil with lime column is analyzed.
    The lime column is modeled using a two noded plane frame element with three degrees
    of freedom (DOF) (two transnational and one rotational), whereas the soil stress-
    strain behavior is presumed to be non-lining and modeled by a Cam-Clay model.
    The properties of lime column is obtained from a stress- strain curve obtained
    from a laboratory test. It is concluded from the study that addition of lime column
    in soft soil reduces the settlement after the construction.&lt;/p&gt;'
