  title: Conservation Techniques For Soil Erosion Control In Tobacco-Based Farming
    System At Steep Land Areas Of Progo Hulu Subwatershed, Central Java, Indonesia
  abstract: 'This research was aimed at determining the impact of conservation techniques
    including bench terrace, stone terrace, mulching, grass strip and intercropping
    on soil erosion at tobacco-based farming system at Progo Hulu subwatershed, Central
    Java, Indonesia. Research was conducted from September 2007 to September 2009,
    located at Progo Hulu subwatershed, Central Java, Indonesia. Research site divided
    into 27 land units, and experimental fields were grouped based on the soil type
    and slope, ie: 30%, 45% and 70%, with the following treatments: 1) ST0= stone
    terrace (control); 2) ST1= stone terrace + Setaria spacelata grass strip on a
    5 cm height dike at terrace lips + tobacco stem mulch with dose of 50% (7 ton/
    ha); 3) ST2= stone terrace + Setaria spacelata grass strip on a 5 cm height dike
    at terrace lips + tobacco stem mulch with dose of 100% (14 ton/ ha); 4) ST3= stone
    terrace + tobacco and red bean intercropping + tobacco stem mulch with dose of
    50% (7 ton/ ha). 5) BT0= bench terrace (control); 6) BT1= bench terrace + Setaria
    spacelata grass strip at terrace lips + tobacco stem mulch with dose of 50% (7
    ton/ ha); 7) BT2= bench terrace + Setaria spacelata grass strip at terrace lips
    + tobacco stem mulch with dose of 100% (14 ton/ ha); 8) BT3= bench terrace + tobacco
    and red bean intercropping + tobacco stem mulch with dose of 50% (7 ton/ ha).
    The results showed that the actual erosion rates of research site were higher
    than that of tolerance erosion with mean value 89.08 ton/ha/year and 33.40 ton/ha/year,
    respectively. These resulted in 69% of total research site (5,119.15 ha) highly
    degraded. Conservation technique of ST2 was the most effective in suppressing
    soil erosion, by 42.87%, following with BT2 as much 30.63%. Others suppressed
    erosion only less than 21%.'
