  title: Soil Stabilization by use of Chemical
  abstract: 'This work presented to see the efficiency of nano technology used in
    terms of chemical named as Terrasil which acts as a modifier and improves the
    engineering properties of black cotton soil. In India, we see about 51.8 million
    hectors of land area is covered with black cotton soil which is an expansive soil.
    It is seen that black cotton soil is very hard when it is dry, and it loses its
    strength completely when it is wet. Expansive soils are problematic soils worldwide
    and create problems while constructing structures on it. To improve their properties
    various methods are adopted. These soils are removed completely or mixed with
    better quality material or mixed with various additives. This chemical called
    terrasil is tested by conducting various tests like Proctor test, free swelling
    test, etc. Soil samples are treated with different percentage of Terrasil 0.9
    , 1.1 , and 1.3 . Terrasil gives improved results up to 40 increasing compressive
    strength of soil. It reduces the swelling property of soil from 60 to 42 . Sheetal
