  title: Boron deficiency in calcareous soil reduces rice yield and impairs grain
    quality
  abstract: This article 'Boron deficiency in calcareous soil reduces rice yield and
    impairs grain quality' appeared in the International Rice Research Notes series,
    created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to expedite communication
    among scientists concerned with the development of improved technology for rice
    and rice-based systems. The series is a mechanism to help scientists keep each
    other informed of current rice research findings. The concise scientific notes
    are meant to encourage rice scientists to communicate with one another to obtain
    details on the research reported.
