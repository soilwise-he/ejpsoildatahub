  title: Degradation Biokinetics Of Used And Fresh Lube Oils In Contaminated Soil
    Environment
  abstract: In order to solve the problems of the soil environment caused by the discharge
    of petroleum products especially oils used for lubrication, investigations were
    carried out to assess the degradation of fresh and used lube oil in soil environment
    using bacteria degraders present in the soil. This was done by introducing some
    quantities of the pollutant (fresh and used lubricating oils) into some soil samples
    obtained from the environment. The degradation pattern was studied by estimating
    the level of the microbial growth using culture method and the phenol content.
    This was done before the introduction of the pollutant and at two weekly intervals
    for 42days. Results show that the phenol content, microbial and micro species
    present in the soil rapidly increased to maximum and then declined. The specific
    rate, maximum specific rate and equilibrium constants were determined using Line-Weaver
    Burk Plots. Results obtained show that the bacteria which degraded the fresh and
    used lube oil were inhibited by the presence of phenol which was informed during
    the biodegradation reaction. Empirical equation for microbial growth rate using
    the data from the experiment was obtained. The degradation of the fresh lube oil
    occurred faster than the used lube oil. The equation is useful in monitoring and
    predicting the performance of microorganisms in bioreactor and predicting the
    performance of microorganisms in bioreactor containing used or fresh lube oil.
