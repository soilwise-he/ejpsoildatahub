    &lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;

    Biodegradable geotextiles have the potential to significantly&lt;br&gt;

    reduce soil loss and ensure slope stability in areas at risk. Here, we&lt;br&gt;

    focus on three biodegradable textiles (namely, jute net, jute mat,&lt;br&gt;

    and wool mat), and study their response in terms of soil loss to&lt;br&gt;

    diverse precipitation events (average rainfall intensity from 3.7&lt;br&gt;

    mmh&minus;1 to 70 mmh&minus;1 and duration from 0.5 h to 11.6 h).&lt;br&gt;

    Experiments are conducted in an ad hoc developed outdoor steep&lt;br&gt;

    slope (more than 60%). Soil loss reduction from the treatments is&lt;br&gt;

    found to be very remarkable (up to 98%), thus supporting the&lt;br&gt;

    potential of natural materials for soil conservation. Also, experimental&lt;br&gt;

    findings confirm that the maximum intensity of rainfall&lt;br&gt;

    events plays an important role in driving soil erosion.&lt;/p&gt;'
