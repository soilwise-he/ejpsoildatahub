  title: Soil Nutrient Dynamics and Yield of Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) Following
    an Amendment with Cattle Manure
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The availability of cattle manure in the study area needs to
    be properly utilized to benefit the environment and provide nutrients to crop.
    A field experiment was conducted during the wet season (June-October) of 2014
    planting season at two locations within the Research Farm of the College of Agriculture,
    Jalingo, Taraba State, Nigeria to determine the effects of cattle manure rates
    on soil nutrient distribution and yield of cotton. Four nitrogen rates in cattle
    manure (150, 200, 250 and 300 kg N/ha) and a control (no amendment) were laid
    out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experimental
    soil was loamy sand whether at the surface (0-15 cm), subsurface (15-30 cm) or
    sub subsurface (30-60 cm) with clay content increasing down the profile. The soil
    pH was moderately acid at the surface but strongly acid at the sub surfaces. Nutrient
    distribution in the soil after cotton harvest shows that nutrients in the soil
    were affected by rates of application of cattle manure with the values increasing
    with increase in manure rates and decreasing as the soil depth increases. The
    yield components such as cottonseed yield, lint yield, seed yield, number of bolls
    per plant and boll weight were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved compared with
    the control. The highest cottonseed yield of 1453 kg/ha was produced from plots
    treated with 250 kg N/ha. Therefore, farmers are encouraged to use cattle manure
    in increasing the fertility level of soil as well as a way of safe agriculture
    with minimum pollution effects.&lt;/p&gt;'
