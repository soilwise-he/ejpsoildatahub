  title: The Small Strain Effects To The Shear Strength And Maximum Stiffness Of Post-Cyclic
    Degradation Of Hemic Peat Soil
  abstract: "The laboratory tests for measuring the effects of small strain to the\
    \ shear strength and maximum stiffness development of post-cyclic degradation\
    \ of hemic peat are reviewed in this paper. A series of laboratory testing has\
    \ been conducted to fulfil the objective of this research to study the post-cyclic\
    \ behaviour of peat soil and focuses on the small strain characteristics. For\
    \ this purpose, a number of strain-controlled static, cyclic and post-cyclic triaxial\
    \ tests were carried out in undrained condition on hemic peat soil. The shear\
    \ strength and maximum stiffness of hemic peat are evaluated immediately after\
    \ post-cyclic monotonic testing. There are two soil samples taken from West Johor\
    \ and East Malaysia peat soil. Based on these laboratories and field testing data,\
    \ it was found that the shear strength and maximum stiffness of peat soil decreased\
    \ in post-cyclic monotonic loading than its initial shear strength and stiffness.\
    \ In particular, degradation in shear strength and stiffness is more sensitive\
    \ for peat soil due to fragile and uniform fibre structures. Shear strength of\
    \ peat soil, \u03C4<sub>max</sub> = 12.53 kPa (Beaufort peat, BFpt) and 36.61\
    \ kPa (Parit Nipah peat, PNpt) decreased than its initial 58.46 kPa and 91.67\
    \ kPa. The maximum stiffness, G<sub>max</sub> = 0.23 and 0.25 decreased markedly\
    \ with post-cyclic, G<sub>max</sub> = 0.04 and 0.09. Simple correlations between\
    \ the G<sub>max</sub> and the \u03C4<sub>max</sub> effects due to small strain,\
    \ \u03B5 = 0.1, the G<sub>max</sub> values for post-cyclic are relatively low\
    \ compared to its initial G<sub>max</sub>. As a consequence, the reported values\
    \ and patterns of both the West Johor and East Malaysia peat soil are generally\
    \ the same."
