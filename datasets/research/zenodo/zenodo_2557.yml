  title: Assessment of heavy metal adsorption potential of lateritic soil used as
    landfill liner material in waste containment structures
  abstract: Deptt. of Civil Engineering, Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia, West
    Bengal, India Increasing soil and groundwater pollution by heavy metals through
    anthropogenic reason is a major concern of present environment. The objective
    of the present study was to assess the potential of lateritic soil to be used
    as liner material in landfill, effluent drain and effluent pond particularly with
    respect to subsurface transport of Zn &amp; Cu. In the present study, the adsorption
    and migration of the two metals (Zn &amp; Cu) through lateritic soil were studied
    using batch adsorption tests. The laboratory scale batch adsorption experiments
    were performed to determine adsorption capacity of the soil by carrying out adsorption
    isotherms and kinetic studies at different initial concentrations (0.5, 1, 5,
    10 mg/l) of adsorbate at a fixed pH of 8 and with different adsorbent doses (5,
    10, 20, 30 g/L) and an equilibrium contact time of 120 minutes. The soil used
    as adsorbent in batch adsorption experiments was found to have low hydraulic conductivity
    of 3.17x10<sup>-8</sup> cm/s, and thus suitable to be used as a liner material
    in waste containment structures. The linear, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm
    models were examined for fitting with the laboratory batch adsorption experimental
    results. The Langmuir isotherm provided best fit for Zn adsorption test data with
    R<sup>2</sup> (co-efficient of determination)=0.922 and RMSE(root mean square
    error) =0.000962 at a soil dose of 5.0 g/L. Similar trend was observed with Cu
    adsorption test results with R<sup>2</sup>= 0.989, RMSE =0.000588 at a soil dose
    of 5 g/L. The higher values of adsorption capacity (qZn =1845 mg/kg, qCu = 1796.8
    mg/Kg) of the soil for both the metals indicate good attenuative potential of
    the soil with respect to Cu &amp; Zn. It was concluded from the present study
    that the lateritic soil can be used as an effective adsorbent and a barrier material
    and can be used as a primary liner material in a waste containment structure for
    retarding the migration of contaminants and thereby protecting the precious groundwater.
