  title: Effect Of Petroleum Crude Oil On Mineral Nutrient Elements, Soil Properties
    And Bacterial Biomass Of The Rhizosphere Of Jojoba
  abstract: 'Aims: This study is to evaluate the effect of petroleum crude oil contaminated
    soil on the mineral nutrient elements, soil properties and bacterial biomass of
    the rhizosphere of jojoba plants (Simmodsia chinensis). Methodology: A pot experiment
    was carried out. The soil was treated with different levels of crude oil: 1, 2
    and 3% v/w either alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers. Results:
    Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration increased in jojoba leaves when grown in petroleum
    oil polluted soil especially at 2% and 3% crude oil. It was noted that, Na, Mg
    and Ca decreased while K increased in shoots of jojoba. In roots Na and Ca increased
    however K and Mg decreased with increasing crude oil concentration in the soil.
    Heavy metals, Cu, Mn, Cd and Pb increased in both shoot and root with increasing
    crude oil concentration while, Zn decreased comparing with the control. In soil,
    N and K decreased meanwhile Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn as well as organic matter increased
    with increasing crude oil concentration. Soil was free from P while, the addition
    of inorganic fertilizers improved P content. Bacterial account was significantly
    increased at the end of the experiment at 1% and 2% crude oil especially after
    addition of inorganic fertilizers. The electric conductivity and MDA of the leaves
    increased with increasing crude oil concentration. The addition of inorganic fertilizers
    to crude oil contaminated soil decreased the electric conductivity and MDA comparing
    with crude oil only. Conclusion: The observed changes in composition of mineral
    elements in jojoba plants in the present study could be attributed to the cell
    injury and disruption in the cell membrane, heavy metal accumulation and toxic
    nature of the petroleum oil. Also this study has demonstrated that soil contamination
    with crude oil has a highly significant effect of reducing some mineral element
    composition of Jojoba plants.'
