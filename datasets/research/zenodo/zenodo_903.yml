  title: Biochar increases soil N2O emissions produced by nitrification-mediated pathways
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In spite of the numerous studies reporting a decrease in soil
    nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions after biochar amendment,
    there is still a lack of understanding of the processes involved. Hence the subject
    remains controversial, with a number of studies showing no changes or even an
    increase in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions after biochar soil application.
    Unraveling the exact causes of these changes, and in which circumstances biochar
    decreases or increases emissions, is vital to developing and applying successful
    mitigation strategies. With this objective, we studied two soils (Haplic Phaeozem
    (HP) and Haplic Calcisol (HC)), which showed opposed responses to biochar amendment.
    Under the same experimental conditions, the addition of biochar to soil HP decreased
    N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions by 76%; whereas it increased emissions by
    54% in soil HC. We combined microcosm experiments adding different nitrogen fertilizers,
    stable isotope techniques and the use of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyciandiamide)
    with the aim of improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
    formation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in these two soils. Evidence suggests
    that denitrification is the main pathway leading to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
    emissions in soil HP, and ammonia oxidation and nitrifier-denitrification being
    the major processes generating N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in soil HC. Biochar
    systematically stimulated nitrification in soil HC, which was probably the cause
    of the increased N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions. Here we demonstrate that
    the effectiveness of using biochar for reducing N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions
    from a particular soil is linked to its dominant N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O formation
    pathway.&lt;/p&gt;'
