  title: Potassium silicate for mitigation of irrigation water deficiency for Faba
    bean intercropped with sugar beet in a sandy soil
  abstract: "A field experiment was carried out at Ismailia Agricultural Research\
    \ Station, Agricultural Research Center, Ismailia governorate (Lat. 30\xB0 35'\
    \ 30\" N, Long. 32\xB0 14' 50\" E, 10 m a.s.l.), Egypt, during 2018/2019 and 2019/2020\
    \ growing seasons to determine the suitable rate of potassium silicate that could\
    \ mitigate the effect of irrigation water deficiency on productivity of both faba\
    \ bean and sugar beet under intercropping system. Three irrigation treatments\
    \ (I<sub>1 </sub>(120% ETo), I<sub>2 </sub>(100% ETo) and I<sub>3 </sub>(80% ETo))\
    \ and three rates of sprayed potassium silicate (Si<sub>0 </sub>unsprayed-control),\
    \ Si<sub>1 </sub>(200 ppm) and Si<sub>2 </sub>(300 ppm)) were used. The results\
    \ showed the highest intercropped faba bean and sugar beet yields and their components\
    \ were attained under spraying with Si<sub>1 </sub>under the three irrigation\
    \ treatments in both growing seasons. Furthermore, spraying intercropped faba\
    \ bean and sugar beet with Si<sub>1 </sub>under I<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>3 </sub>relieved\
    \ water deficiency and increased the yields, compared to no spraying. The 2-year\
    \ average values of applied irrigation water to sugar beet intercropping system\
    \ were 9252, 7730, 6184 m<sup>3</sup>/ha under I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub> and\
    \ I<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Using cereal units analysis revealed that the highest\
    \ values WUE and WP were found under application of I<sub>3</sub>, namely 0.29\
    \ CU/mm and 0.36 CU/mm for WUE and 0.24 CU/mm and 0.25 CU/mm for WP in the first\
    \ and second seasons, respectively. The highest values of WER were 1.41 and 1.42\
    \ obtained from the interaction between irrigation with I<sub>2</sub> and spraying\
    \ with Si<sub>1 </sub>in the first and second season, respectively. Thus, it could\
    \ be concluded that to mitigate the effect of irrigation deficiency applied to\
    \ faba bean intercropped with sugar beet, spraying with 200 ppm of potassium silicate\
    \ should be applied."
