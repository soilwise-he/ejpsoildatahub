  title: Principal Component Analysis For The Characterization In The Application
    Of Some Soil Properties
  abstract: 'The objective of this research is to study principal

    component analysis for classification of 67 soil samples collected from

    different agricultural areas in the western part of Thailand. Six soil

    properties were measured on the soil samples and are used as original

    variables. Principal component analysis is applied to reduce the

    number of original variables. A model based on the first two

    principal components accounts for 72.24% of total variance. Score

    plots of first two principal components were used to map with

    agricultural areas divided into horticulture, field crops and wetland.

    The results showed some relationships between soil properties and

    agricultural areas. PCA was shown to be a useful tool for agricultural

    areas classification based on soil properties.'
