  title: Evaluation of the geotechnical behaviour of a volcanic soil wall with additions
    of lime and cement against landslides
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;The construction of earth walls can be a significant response
    to prevent the next landslides from reaching the road and avoid accidents. Therefore,
    a material of the same slope was used and reinforced with mixtures of lime and
    cement, with this same reinforced material a mechanically stabilized hypothetical
    earth wall (MSE) was developed. An analysis of the original slope was developed
    to check if there was a possible failure through its safety factor. Then, a hypothetical
    wall was developed with a floor reinforced with mixtures, in order to assess its
    overall safety factor and its maximum landslides. According to the results, in
    principle it was determined that the dosage M-3 / C-4-4 improves in a range of
    30% to 37% the friction angle. In addition, it was found that a reinforced wall,
    that is to say with Lime and cement additions, presents a better behaviour. In
    its effect, its displacements are about 8 mm and have a global factor of 1.23.&lt;/p&gt;'
