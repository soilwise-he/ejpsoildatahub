  title: Population dynamics of plant-parasitic nematodes and their relation to soil
    properties in tea
  abstract: 'A study was conducted to assess the occurrence of plant parasitic nematodes
    (PPNs) and their relationship with soil properties from July 2015 to December
    2015 at the Lackatoorah, Malnicherra, and Ali Bahar tea estates in the North Sylhet
    region of Bangladesh. Rhizosphere soil samples were taken at a depth of 23 cm
    from the primary nursery bed, secondary nursery bed, first-year plantation, and
    second-year plantation of the selected tea estates. Root samples were also collected
    from four locations of the above tea estates. Nematodes were extracted from the
    soil samples using the Baermann funnel method. Physico-chemical properties of
    the soil like textural class, sand (%), silt (%), clay (%), pH, and organic matter
    (%) from different locations of the aforementioned tea gardens were also determined
    to find out their relationship with nematodes population. The result revealed
    that out of 60 collected soil samples from different locations of selected tea
    estates, 47 were infested with PPNs with frequencies of 78.33%. The average frequency
    of occurrence was maximum (90.00%) and minimum (65.00%) in the soil samples of
    the Malnicherra and Lackatoorah tea estates, respectively. The highest frequency
    of PPNs was observed in the soil samples of the secondary nursery bed of selected
    tea gardens, with a frequency of 93.00%. The maximum frequency of occurrence (80.00%)
    was observed in the root samples of the secondary nursery bed, and that was the
    minimum (26.67%) in the second-year plantation. The highest numbers of PPNs were
    observed in the soil of the Malnicherra tea estate, followed by Lackatoorah and
    Ali Bahar tea estates. The mean numbers of PPNs were lowest in soil and root samples
    of second-year plantations from all the tea estates. According to pH, the selected
    tea estates were under moderately acidic soil with a range of 4.3-5.0. Three types
    of soil texture were found in different tea estates: sandy, sandy loam, and sandy
    clay loam. The highest nematode population was observed in sandy loam soil, and
    the lowest was in sandy soil. Maximum PPN was found in the sand, silt, and clay
    within the range of 70-80%, 8-13%, and 9-18%, respectively. The population of
    PPNs was linearly and positively correlated with soil pH and organic matter (%)
    in all three tea estates.'
