  title: The Growth and Yield Performance of Sweet Melon as Affected by Years of Usage
    for Formulated Treated Soil in North Central Nigeria
  abstract: Abstract The study was carried out at the National Centre for Agricultural
    Mechanization Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria to evaluate the performance of formulated/treated
    soil used over a period of three years for vegetable production in a greenhouse,
    using response to sweet melon (galia f1) as case study. The experiment was conducted
    using a completely randomized design with four replications. Data were collected
    on the growth and yield of sweet melon and analyzed using analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) at 5% level of significant difference and Duncan multiple range tests
    was used to separate the means. The result showed that the average values of fruit
    yield obtained from the freshly formulated/treated soil, formulated/treated used
    soil and untreated soil (the control) are 5.45kg; 4.70kg and 1.95kg respectively.
    It is therefore concluded that the formulated treated soil as described in this
    work can be used in greenhouse melon farming, sustainably with good productivity
    for minimum of three years.
