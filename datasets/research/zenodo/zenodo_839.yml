  title: Influence of Minerology on the Engineering Properties of Lateritic Soil
  abstract: Laterite is a soil which is having a high content of iron and aluminium
    and is mostly found in hot and wet tropical areas. They are formed through a process
    known as Laterization which is a combination of intensive and prolonged chemical
    process and leaching. The mineralogical compound of various samples of lateritic
    soils will be identified by carrying out microscopic analysis. The influence of
    mineralogical composition on bearing capacity will be investigated by carrying
    out laboratory scale load tests on model footings.
