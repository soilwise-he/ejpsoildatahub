  title: Remediation of Paddy Soil Contaminated by Endosulfan Residues by Applying
    a Combination of Farmyard Manures and Corn Cob Biochar
  abstract: "<strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br> Organochlorine insecticides including endosulfan\
    \ are used intensively since Indonesia\u2019s<br> \u2018green revolution\u2019\
    \ of the 1960s to 1980s, to reduce yield loss of food crops due to pest<br> incidence.\
    \ As one of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) compounds, endosulfan<br>\
    \ residues are still found in rice fields to the present day although it had already\
    \ banned.<br> Using organic matter such as biochar and farmyard manures is a remediation\
    \ strategy<br> to reduce endosulfan concentration in soils. This research was\
    \ conducted in a<br> greenhouse to determine the concentration of endosulfan residues\
    \ in paddy soils which<br> applied a combination of farmyard manures and corn\
    \ cob biochar. The experiment was<br> conducted with a completely randomized design\
    \ including three replicates and seven<br> treatments that combined farmyard manures\
    \ and corn cob biochar. The 14-days old<br> seedling of Ciherang variety was transplanted\
    \ intopots weighing 13 kg with paddy soils.<br> Variables measured were grain\
    \ yield, yield component, crop agronomic growth,<br> endosulfan concentration\
    \ in soil, water, grains, microbial population, soil pH, and redox<br> potential.\
    \ The combination of cattle farmyard manure and biochar with a 4:1 ratio<br> reduced\
    \ effectively the largest endosulfan residues in the panicle initiation growth\
    \ phase<br> and maturity growth phase by as much as 68.1% and 62.8%, respectively,\
    \ compared<br> with treatment of without soil amendment. The largest microbial\
    \ population in the<br> panicle initiation growth phase was achieved by a treatment\
    \ that combined cattle<br> farmyard manure and biochar with a 4:1 ratio. The combination\
    \ of farmyard manure<br> and corn cob biocharreduced a significant amount of endosulfan\
    \ in percolation waterand<br> rice grains. As well as functioning as a remediator,\
    \ organic soil amendment which<br> consists of farmyard manure and corn cob biochar\
    \ improves rice productivity<br> significantly by as much as 8\u201326%."
