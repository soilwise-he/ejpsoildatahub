  title: Manipulating soil microbial communities in extensive green roof substrates
  abstract:
  - '&lt;p&gt;There has been very little investigation into the soil microbial community
    on green roofs, yet this below ground habitat is vital for ecosystem functioning.
    Green roofs are often harsh environments that would greatly benefit from having
    a healthy microbial system, allowing efficient nutrient cycling and a degree of
    drought tolerance in dry summer months. To test if green roof microbial communities
    could be manipulated, we added mycorrhizal fungi and a microbial mixture (&lsquo;compost
    tea&rsquo;) to green roof rootzones, composed mainly of crushed brick or crushed
    concrete. The study revealed that growing media type and depth play a vital role
    in the microbial ecology of green roofs. There are complex relationships between
    depth and type of substrate and the biomass of different microbial groups, with
    no clear pattern being observed. Following the addition of inoculants, bacterial
    groups tended to increase in biomass in shallower substrates, whereas fungal biomass
    change was dependent on depth and type of substrate. Increased fungal biomass
    was found in shallow plots containing more crushed concrete and deeper plots containing
    more crushed brick where compost tea (a live mixture of beneficial bacteria) was
    added, perhaps due to the presence of helper bacteria for arbuscular mycorrhizal
    fungi (AMF). Often there was not an additive affect of the microbial inoculations
    but instead an antagonistic interaction between the added AM fungi and the compost
    tea. This suggests that some species of microbes may not be compatible with others,
    as competition for limited resources occurs within the various substrates. The
    overall results suggest that microbial inoculations of green roof habitats are
    sustainable. They need only be done once for increased biomass to be found in
    subsequent years, indicating that this is a novel and viable method of enhancing
    roof community composition.&lt;/p&gt;'
  - 'We manipulated microbial communities in a green roof rootzone by adding arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungi and a microbial mixture (''compost tea'').


    Inoculants generally increased bacterial biomass in shallower substrates.


    Compost tea increased fungal biomass in shallow plots containing more crushed
    concrete and deeper plots containing more crushed brick.


    Often there was an antagonistic interaction between the AM fungi and compost tea
    treatments.


    Treatments seemed sustainable and further inoculations were not required (in this
    short-term study).'
