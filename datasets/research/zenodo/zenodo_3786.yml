  title: Determination Of Unsaturated Soil Permeability Based On Geometric Factor
    Development Of Constant Discharge Model
  abstract: "After Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006, the main problem that occurred in\
    \ the first yard of Prambanan Temple is ponding area that occurred after rainfall.\
    \ Soil characterization needs to be determined by conducting several processes,\
    \ especially permeability coefficient (<em>k</em>) in both saturated and unsaturated\
    \ conditions to solve this problem. More accurate and efficient field testing\
    \ procedure is required to obtain permeability data that present the field condition.\
    \ One of the field permeability test equipment is Constant Discharge procedure\
    \ to determine the permeability coefficient. Necessary adjustments of the Constant\
    \ Discharge procedure are needed to be determined especially the value of geometric\
    \ factor (<em>F</em>) to improve the corresponding value of permeability coefficient.\
    \ The value of <em>k</em> will be correlated with the value of volumetric water\
    \ content (<em>\u03B8</em>) of an unsaturated condition until saturated condition.\
    \ The principle procedure of Constant Discharge model provides a constant flow\
    \ in permeameter tube that flows into the ground until the water level in the\
    \ tube becomes constant. Constant water level in the tube is highly dependent\
    \ on the tube dimension. Every tube dimension has a shape factor called the geometric\
    \ factor that affects the result of the test. Geometric factor value is defined\
    \ as the characteristic of shape and radius of the tube. This research has modified\
    \ the geometric factor parameters by using empty material tube method so that\
    \ the geometric factor will change. Saturation level is monitored by using soil\
    \ moisture sensor. The field test results were compared with the results of laboratory\
    \ tests to validate the results of the test. Field and laboratory test results\
    \ of empty tube material method have an average difference of 3.33 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\
    \ cm/sec. The test results showed that modified geometric factor provides more\
    \ accurate data. The improved methods of constant discharge procedure provide\
    \ more relevant results."
