  title: Experimental Study Of Soil Cement Bricks And Characteristics Compressivestrength
    Of Brick  Masonry Wall
  abstract: "This research is intended to provide detailed technical and economic\
    \ information on the production of compressed cement stabilised soil bricks. These\
    \ include information on suitable soil types, local stabilisers, stabilization\
    \ techniques, production of compressed stabilized soil bricks and their economical\
    \ value and potential. Critical review of related literatures show that soil types,\
    \ proportions between soil and stabilizer and compaction pressure applied to the\
    \ moist soil mix affects the quality of the compressed soil brick. Since the soil\
    \ used to manufacture the stabilized soil bricks are abundantly available all\
    \ around the Tamil Nadu. Laboratory tests conducted on Perundurai area soil provided\
    \ more precise and detailed information on the soils grading, plasticity, chemical\
    \ composition and the result proved the soil\u2019s suitability for brick production.\
    \ Using the Ordinary Portland Cement manufactured as stabilizer and soil sample\
    \ from Perundurai, three different series of tests were prepared based on literature\
    \ recommendations. Tests were conducted   on soil bricks performance like compressive\
    \ strength and water absorption on which the durability of the blocks depend.\
    \ The effects of compaction pressure on the quality of the soil bricks, the optimum\
    \ cement content for stabilization and cost comparison with hollow concrete bricks\
    \ are prepared.  The performance characteristics of  local  stabilizers  are \
    \ evaluated  and comparisons  are made. The investigation has revealed that from\
    \ the bricks produced at the varying cement contents from 12% in increments of\
    \ 2% up to 16% at constant compressive pressure of 10MPa, all the blocks except\
    \ bricks produced by 16% cement have 21<sup>st</sup>day wet compressive strength\
    \ values well above most of the recommended minimum values for use in structural\
    \ work. Thus 16% cement is taken as optimum cement content for stabilization of\
    \ Tamil Nadu soil for brick production. Further increasing cement content results\
    \ in an increase in the compressive strength value and a decrease in the absorption\
    \ capacity of the soil brick. Increment of the compaction pressure also improves\
    \ the compressive strength of soil cement brick. Comparisons of the effects of\
    \ local brick masonry and soil  brickmasonry  showed that soil brick masonry has\
    \ shown better stabilization effect based on the 21<sup>st</sup>day compressive\
    \ strength of bricks. The cost comparison with the conventional wall making material,\
    \ hollow concrete bricks, has revealed that compressed cement stabilized soil\
    \ brick is preferred because it is more economical walling material lin itself\
    \ and permits the use of economical building techniques."
