  title: Enhance Land Support Layer Road Pavement Subgrade Soil Plant Stability Based
    on Geotextile
  abstract: <em>At the stage of a construction work one of the main problems in soft
    soil is the large land decline. The large decrease is due to the decrease in soil.
    The condition of poor base soil in the form of clay soil needs to be done to improve
    the basic soil to be able to support the construction load. One method used as
    land improvement is by geotextiles. This paper described type of geotextile used
    in the construction of the Medan-Kualanamu-Tebing Tinggi toll road project, Parbarakan-Lubuk
    Pakam Sta.42 + 750-Sta.47 + 600 is a geotextile PP woven polypropylene. The geotextile
    type uses non woven geotextile while the study is geotextile polypropylene woven,
    Non woven tensile strength 20 kN / m required 1 layer of geotextile while tensile
    strength Polypropylene woven 30 kN / m required 2 layers of geotextile. From these
    calculations can be concluded that the use of geotextiles can be used as one of
    the repair and retrofitting</em>.
