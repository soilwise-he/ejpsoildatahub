  title: Effect of raft thickness and soil modulus on frequency and amplitude of building
    frame
  abstract: The paper presents the limited study on the evaluation of the response
    of the dynamic soil structure interaction analysis of a two storeyed building
    frame resting on raft foundation using finite element method. The components of
    the building frame such as beams, columns and slabs along with the raft are modeled
    using 20 noded isoparametric continuum elements. The soil surrounding the foundation
    is modeled in the simplified manner using discrete independent springs. The interface
    of soil and raft has been accounted for by incorporating 16 node interface elements
    in the modeling. Further, the components of the superstructure and substructure
    are treated to behave in the linear elastic manner whereas the soil media is idealized
    to behave in the non-linear manner. The effect of raft thickness and soil modulus
    is evaluated on the dynamic response of the frame. The response is considered
    in terms of the frequency and amplitude. The result indicates that the dynamic
    loading and SSI has a considerable effect on the response of the structure.
