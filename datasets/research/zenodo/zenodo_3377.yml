  title: State of the Art in Unsaturated Soil Testing
  abstract: "Abstract In most soil mechanics laboratories, studies on soil behaviour\
    \ are systematically carried out under saturated conditions in accordance with\
    \ the TERZAGHI postulate. However, due to climatic conditions (arid, semi-arid,\
    \ extreme continental), soils are often in a state of unsaturation and no longer\
    \ meet Terzaghi's laws. These soils undergo alternating dry and wet seasons and\
    \ are subject to drainage and humidification cycles. Depending on their nature,\
    \ and especially in the case of fine soils, these variations in water status can\
    \ lead to disorders due to phenomena such as swelling, shrinkage, or collapse.\
    \ It is then necessary to have a good knowledge of these soils. To study unsaturated\
    \ soils, it is then important to understand the phenomena which take place there\
    \ and their mechanical behavior. \n\nThe present article therefore proposes to\
    \ present an overview of the different phenomena that characterize unsaturated\
    \ soils and particularly the tests proposed to explain their mechanical behavior.\n\
    \nTaking into account and controlling the unsaturated state of soils will allow\
    \ to solve in a more efficient way the problems related to structures such as:\
    \ embankment dams, dikes, road embankments, slopes, tunnels."
