  title: "Using The Potential Of Synergy \u2013 Developing A Tool To Design Ecosystems\
    \ For A Sustainable Soil Management"
  abstract: 'Using biomimicry approach, where cultivation and productivity are more
    dependent on intrinsic dynamics than on human/chemical inputs driven by fossil
    fuels.


    To specifically target intrinsic, synergetic dynamics for agricultural systems
    and overcome difficulties linked to poor knowledge and hazardous trial-and-error
    processes for  intercropping, this is a proposal for an informatics tool to design
    adapted, efficient plant partnerships or clusters.


    The tool consists of a prediction model that suggests potential win-win plant
    or other symbiotic relationships, flexible enough to exploit information about
    local soil/climatic conditions.'
