  title: Performance of five Faba bean varieties under different irrigation intervals
    and sowing dates in newly reclaimed soil
  abstract: "<strong>\u201C\u201D</strong> IJAAR welcome all of you to submit your\
    \ research paper for publication in the field of <strong><em>Agriculture, Agronomy,\
    \ Horticulture</em></strong> etc. Please submit your manuscripts via <strong><em>Online\

    In order to study the effect of irrigation and sowing date on plant characteristics,\
    \ chemical and yield traits of five faba bean cultivars, an experiment was conducted\
    \ in two growing seasons in the farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Demo, Fayoum\
    \ University, Egypt. Using split-split plot in RCBD with three replications. Irrigation\
    \ intervals (I) was considered as the main plot in the three intervals (irrigation\
    \ every 20, 30 and 40 days). Three sowing dates (22ndOct., 7thand 22ndNov.) were\
    \ arranged in the sub plot. The sub-sub plots were varieties (Nubaria1, Nubaria2,\
    \ Giza3 improved, Sakha1 and Sakha2). Results indicated that the effect of irrigation\
    \ every 20 days (I1) surpassed the others two where it produced higher values\
    \ of plant height (87.34cm), seed yield (1.81ton/feddan) and carbohydrate % (46.73%).The\
    \ early sowing date (22nd October) produced the highest values of all yield attributes\
    \ and carbohydrate percentage with the exception of harvest index and protein\
    \ percentage in combined analysis. Giza3 improved achieved the superiority only\
    \ on plant height trait, while Nubaria2 achieved the superiority on number of\
    \ pods/plant and height to first pod. While, Nubaria1 variety presented the first\
    \ class in number of branches, pods and seeds weight/plant, 100-seed yield, seed\
    \ and straw yield and carbohydrate %. The highest values of pods and seeds weight/plant\
    \ were 57.04 and 45.32gm, as well as 100-seed weight (gm) and seed yield (ton/fed.)\
    \ were 118.37 (gm) and 2.04 (ton/fed.) respectively, were obtained by irrigation\
    \ every 30 days with early sowing with Nubaria1 variety.\n\n<strong><em>International\
