  title: Isolation of Soil Thiobacterii and Determination of Their Bio-Oxidation Activity
  abstract: "36 strains of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were isolated in \nSouthern Kazakhstan\
    \ soda-saline soils and identified. Screening of \nstrains according bio-oxidation\
    \ (destruction thiosulfate to sulfate) and \nenzymatic (Thiosulfate dehydrogenises\
    \ and thiosulfate reductase) \nactivity was conducted. There were selected modes\
    \ of aeration and \nculture conditions (pH, temperature), which provide optimum\
    \ harvest \ncells. These strains can be used in bio-melioration technology."
