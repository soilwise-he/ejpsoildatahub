  title: A Review Paper on Experimental Study on Stabilization of Soil Subgrade by
    Adding Stone Dust
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Subgrade is the lower most layer of the pavement construction.
    So soil subgrade should be capable strong to carry load coming from the upper
    layer. Many stabilization techniques are adopted to improve the stability and
    bearing capacity of soil. In this study we use Kota stone dust that is easily
    available in Rajasthan state as a waste form. In this stone dust we find that
    nearly 30 lime is available so can be used for it like as lime stabilization.
    By adding Kota stone bearing capacity increase of the soil. Deepak Kumar | Magandeep
