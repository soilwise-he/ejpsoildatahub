  title: Present Status of Low Depth Shrimp Farming System with Special Reference
    to Soil-water Characteristics in South-West Region of Bangladesh
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Management of soil and water quality parameters is important\
    \ catalysts for gaining sustainable fish production in Bangladesh. In this context,\
    \ a comprehensive survey was done to categories existing shrimp farms locally\
    \ called ghers of Sadar Upazilla covering each union based on water depth. Among\
    \ the ghers, 69% found between 1.5 &lt; to &lt; 3 ft depth, 17% below \u2264 1.5\
    \ ft and 14% \u2265 3 ft. and an investigation was carried out to assess soil-water\
    \ quality parameters and production performance of 9 selected low depth shrimp\
    \ ghers in Bemarta Union under Sadar Upazilla at Bagerhat districts of Bangladesh\
    \ over a growing cycle. Physico-chemical parameters of soil-water needed to be\
    \ measured and analyzed by standard methods. Total yield (3414 kg/ha/cycle in\
    \ T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 2470 kg/ha/cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1482\
    \ kg/ha/cycle in T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) of fishes was also calculated from\
    \ the stocking and harvesting data. Most of the parameters of soil and water correlated\
    \ significantly with each other suggesting a high degree of interactions between\
    \ different parameters in the system. A pattern of qualitative and quantitative\
    \ difference of zooplankton over phytoplankton was also recorded in these farms\
    \ Therefore, a high degree of salinity fluctuation and iron deposition in waters\
    \ was also documented. However, considerably lower concentrations of phosphorus\
    \ in the soil indicated a net retention and trapping of phosphatic nutrients in\
    \ the environment. Moreover cropping pattern was two cycles (fishes single, paddy\
    \ single) per year, feeding frequencies was once in daily and shrimp suitability\
    \ and production ranged from (15-27)% and 247 kg/ha/cycle to 741 kg/ha/cycle.\
    \ The present findings indicate that low depth gher comparatively gives a better\
    \ result in fin fishes than shrimp/prawn and creates a hazardous environment for\
    \ shrimp post larvae survives, viral death, health risk and economically not viable\
    \ for sustainable shrimp production in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;"
