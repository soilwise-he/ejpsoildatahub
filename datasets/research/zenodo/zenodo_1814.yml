  title: Ionic Mobility of Cations as Affected by Redox Status of Two Different Soil
    Textures
  abstract: Movement of ions within the soil plays a key role in nutrient availability
    as well as<br> soil management. Various reactions in the soil contribute to soil
    ionic mobility and<br> consequently nutrient availability, one of which is the
    oxidation-reduction reaction. Hence,<br> this study sets out to evaluate the effect
    of redox status of the soil on ionic mobility of cations.<br> A 3x2x2 factorial
    experiment was set up on two different soil types (clay loam and sandy clay<br>
    loam), arranged in a Randomzed complete Block design (RCBD) with three replicates.
    The<br> treatment combination involved three levels of poultry manure (0 tha-1,
    6 tha-1 and 8 tha-1),<br> two levels of NPK 15-15-15 (0 gha-1, 200 kgha-1) and
    two water regimes (field capacity and<br> waterlogging). Twelve treatments were
    obtained giving rise to different redox potential.<br> Redox potential was measured
    using a redox meter, electrical conductivity using a<br> conductivity meter; Ionic
    mobility was calculated using the mobility equation.<br> Results from this study
    show that ionic mobility was highest under highly reduced<br> conditions, also
    ionic mobility was highest in sandy clay loam than clayey loam and<br> potassium
    ion has the highest mobility while magnesium has the lowest mobility. It was<br>
    concluded that soils can be subjected to reduction process to increase the mobility
    of cations<br> hence there availability to plant. However care must be taken to
    avoid the loss of highly<br> mobile ions like potassium.
