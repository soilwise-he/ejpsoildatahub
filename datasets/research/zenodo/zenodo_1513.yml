  title: TEXTILE PROCESSOR UNIT'S WATER EFFLUENT TOXICITY AND DEGRADATION OF SOIL
    AT SANGANER (JAIPUR
  abstract: "ABSTRACT \n\nSoil degradation from various inorganic and organic contaminants,\
    \ is not only an ecological risk, but simultaneously it is also a Socio-economic\
    \ issue, such soils become poor in physicochemical properties, susceptible to\
    \ erosion, loss of productivity, sustainability and diminished food chain quality.\
    \ The dye industrial effluent directly used for irrigation at Sanganer area Jaipur\
    \ city. Soil samples were collected from both areas i.e. contaminated (irrigated\
    \ with effluent water) and uncontaminated areas (not irrigated with effluent water)\
    \ at 0-25cm depth for analysis. Three sites were selected in each area for collection\
    \ of soil samples from ten different locations. Before irrigation waste water\
    \ analysed for selected parameters i.e. pH, electric conductance, bicarbonate,\
    \ chloride, Ca, Mg, Na and K ions while in soil samples various parameters analysed\
    \ were pH, electric conductance, water holding capacity, bicarbonates, Ca, Mg,\
    \ Na, K ions, total organic carbon and organic matter. Results indicate that water\
    \ was alkaline in nature. Chloride was highest (700mg/l) in W1 samples and lowest\
    \ (500mg/l) at W2 samples while other parameters also have great variability.\
    \ Results of soil samples indicate it\u2019s neutral to slight alkaline nature.\
    \ Cation and anion concentration, organic carbon and organic matter were also\
    \ shows a wide variation in contaminated soil samples as compared to uncontaminated\
    \ samples. The study concluded that the continuous application of effluent appears\
    \ to deteriorate soil quality in the area.\n\nKeywords: Physicochemical analysis,\
    \ industrial effluent, Sanganer, contaminated, uncontaminated, dye industry"
