  title: Evaluation of the physico-chemical state of the soil contaminant isolate
    indigenous bacterial species
  abstract: "The aim of the study is to isolate indigenous bacterial species which\
    \ have the ability to degrade crude oil. Samples were collected from an oil polluted\
    \ site in Ejama-Ebubu Eleme Rivers state. The samples were taken from five spot\
    \ (A-E), of depth 0-15 (A1\u2013 E1) and 15-30 (A2\u2013 E2) in sterile polyethylene\
    \ bags, using appropriate equipment, then taken to the laboratory for analysis,\
    \ Physicochemical parameters such as pH, nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, total petroleum\
    \ hydrocarbon (TPH), poly aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), salinity, temperature, conductivity\
    \ and heavy metals (iron, zinc, nikel, lead, chromium) were determined, The THB\
    \ count was determined using the spread plate method on nutrient agar. Soil, sediment\
    \ and water physicochemical parameters determined indicated that the samples had\
    \ been exposed to hydrocarbon contamination. The Gram negative bacteria belonging\
    \ to the genus pseudomonas is the most frequent. Other genera isolated were <em>Nocardia,\
    \ Micrococcus,Chromobacterium, Burkholdia, Corynebacterium.</em> The study revealed\
    \ the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons in the Ejama_Ebubu site as well as known\
    \ genera of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria. The biases associated with culture-dependent\
    \ microbial enumeration techniques may limit the full description of the bacterial\
    \ diversity in Ejama-Ebubu site. From the study, it is concluded that microorganisms\
    \ that can degrade hydrocarbons are found in oil contaminated soil and can easily\
    \ be isolated from these contaminated sites, although it is very difficult to\
    \ work with aromatic hydrocarbons due to their volatility and toxic effects."
