  title: 'Impact of forest development phases on soil C and N stocks: insufficient
    and controversial data'
  abstract: "Soil organic matter is one of the biggest carbon stocks on the planet.\
    \ The stability of soil organic matter depends on many factors, but one of the\
    \ most important is the availability of nitrogen. Therefore it is recommended\
    \ to study C and N stocks simultaneously. There is still insufficient data about\
    \ the distribution of soil organic matter and belowground biomass in forests.\
    \ In this study, we evaluated the content of total organic carbon and total nitrogen\
    \ in Dystric Cambisols of Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh primeval beech forest for each forest\
    \ development phase (FDP). The classification approach and protocol of Zenner\
    \ et al. (2016) were used to identify FPDs. All the studies were conducted in\
    \ three replicates \u2013 three separate locations for each FDP. We analyzed the\
    \ content of carbon and nitrogen in the topsoil (0 \u2013 10 cm) with CHN analyzer.\
    \ The hypothesis was that FDP affects soil properties and in particular content\
    \ of C and N. We thought that content of these elements in the soil would depend\
    \ on the FDP and thus may be used as an additional criterion for the identification\
    \ of the phase. Unfortunately, the dispersion of C and N contents in the group\
    \ (different sites under the one type of development phase) was almost the same\
    \ as between the groups (different development phases). Our results contradict\
    \ with previously published data (Henyk, 2011) that showed significant differences\
    \ in C content in soils under different FDPs. We conclude that i) content of C\
    \ and N in the studied soils was not a sensitive indicator of the FDP; ii) this\
    \ may be explained by statistical noise and other inaccuracies, caused by significant\
    \ spatial heterogeneity of soil properties iii) in future studies should be more\
    \ replicates and Kalman filtering or equivalent should be applied to the raw data."
