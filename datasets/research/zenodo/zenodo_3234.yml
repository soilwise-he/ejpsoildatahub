  title: The results of the assessment of new varieties of Solanum tuberosum L. according
    to the main economic and valuable characteristics depending on the soil and climatic
    zones of cultivation
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;To carry out a comprehensive
    study and evaluation of new varieties of potatoes (&lt;em&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;L.)
    according to the main economic and valuable indicators: yield, resistance to diseases
    and the content of starch and dry matter.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;The qualification examination
    of potato varieties for suitability for distribution in Ukraine (PSP) is carried
    out throughout the territory of Ukraine within the soil and climate zones of the
    Forest Steppe and Polissia in accordance with the Methodology for the qualification
    examination of plant varieties for suitability for distribution in Ukraine (General
    part) and the Methodology for the examination of varieties potato plants and groups
    of vegetable, melon, spicy-tasty plants for their suitability for distribution
    in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Economic and valuable characteristics
    of new potato varieties &lsquo;Acoustic&rsquo;, &lsquo;Lady Amarilla&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sensation&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;Mia&rsquo;, &lsquo;Baltic Fire&rsquo;, included in the State Register of
    plant varieties suitable for distribution in Ukraine (hereinafter &ndash; Register
    of varieties), were studied. An analysis of the varietal potential of potatoes
    was carried out based on the results of the qualification examination of the varieties.
    It was established that the yield of the stu&shy;died potato varieties in all
    years of examination was higher in the forest-steppe zone and exceeded the yield
    obtained in the Polissia zone. In particular, the productivity of the varie&shy;ty
    &lsquo;Sensation&rsquo; by 29%, &lsquo;Mia&rsquo; by 20%, &lsquo;Lady Amarilla&rsquo;
    by 16%, &lsquo;Baltic Fire&rsquo; by 19%, &lsquo;Acoustic&rsquo; by 21%. Varieties
    &lsquo;Sensation&rsquo; (24.3&ndash;33.8 t/ha) and &lsquo;Acoustic&rsquo; (25.5&ndash;30.2
    t/ha) produced the highest yield over the years of research. The varieties &lsquo;Lady
    Amarilla&rsquo; and &lsquo;Baltic Fire&rsquo; prevailed in terms of qua&shy;lity
    indicators: the starch content in their tubers was 13.7&ndash;15.4% and 13.3&ndash;13.9%;
    dry matter content 22.2&ndash;23.2% and 21.5&ndash;22.0%, respectively. Disease
    and pest damage was generally average, with late blight causing the most dama&shy;ge
    to crops in the Polissia zone.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Based on the results of
    the qualification examination, five positive expert opinions were prepared for
    the PSP. All studied varieties are recommended for growing in the Forest-Steppe
    and Polissia zones. Cancer-resistant potato varieties are proposed for introduction
    in disease foci and use as parental components and obtaining disease-resistant
    offspring. Cancer-resistant potato varieties are recommended to be grown in areas
    where the disease is likely to be detected and used in bree&shy;ding to obtain
    new cancer-resistant varieties.&lt;/p&gt;'
