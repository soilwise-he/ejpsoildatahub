  title: Comparative Evaluation of Cementitious Agents Composite materials on Strength
    Improvement Behavior of Black Cotton Clay Soil
  abstract: "ABSTRACT \n\nThis research study investigated the application of cement\
    \ / lime + costus afer fiber ash ( bush sugarcane bagasse fibre ash) as composite\
    \ material to effect changes in strength of natural black cotton marine clay to\
    \ meet the minimum requirements for such applications on Specifications for road\
    \ pavement structural materials (after FMW 1997). Results of compaction relationship\
    \ between optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) at 100%\
    \ clay and cement / lime + bagasse fibre ash treated soil at the ratios of 2.5%\
    \ +2.5%, 5.0% + 5.0%, 7.5% + 7.5% and 10% + 10% of cement / lime and bagasse ash\
    \ to soil. OMC results increased from 12.39% to 12.79% clay + cement + bagasse\
    \ fibre ash and 12.93% to 14.37%. clay +lime + bagasse fibre ash. MDD results\
    \ increased from1.640KN/m3 and 1.78 KN/m3 clay + cement + bagasse fibre ash and\
    \ 1.640KN/m3 and 1.73KN/m3 (clay) clay +lime + bagasse fibre ash. CBR results\
    \ of clay + lime + bagasse fibre ash (BSBFA) at 100% clay, of 2.5% +2.5%, 5.0%\
    \ + 5.0%, 7.5% + 7.5% and 10% + 10% of cement / lime and bagasse ash to soil of\
    \ lime + BSBFA, increased from 7.6% to 17.8% clay +lime + bagasse fibre ash and\
    \ from 7.6% to 13.9% clay + cement + bagasse fibre ash, both showed tremendous\
    \ strength increased with lime having higher values in clay cement / lime, low\
    \ results of cement was attributed to hydration between cement and bagasse ash.\
    \ Results of UCS of soils + cement + BSBFA with ratios ad above showed an increased\
    \ values of 78.6kPa to 623kPa and 78.6kPa to 223kPa clay + lime + BSBFA treated\
    \ clay. Higher strength of UCS was recorded higher in cement to lime samples.\
    \ Results of clay + lime + BSBFA treated clay soil IP decreased from 33.7% to\
    \ 30.8% and while clay + cement + BSBFA 36.8% to 31.2%. Composite materials improved\
    \ strength of expansive soil."
