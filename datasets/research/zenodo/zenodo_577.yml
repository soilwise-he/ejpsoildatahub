  title: 'Enhancing Geotechnical Properties of Expansive Soil through Geopolymer Blended
    with Rice Husk Ash and Metakaolin: A Sustainable Approach for Soil Stabilization'
  abstract: Soil stabilization involves enhancing soil's stability and engineering
    characteristics, which can be achieved through mechanical or chemical methods.
    Extensive research has been conducted to explore traditional and modern techniques
    for stabilizing soil subgrade, particularly in road construction projects where
    a large surface area interacts with the soil. Geopolymers have emerged as a promising
    alternative for soil stabilization, offering the potential to reduce resource
    exploitation and environmental pollution while improving the engineering performance
    of expansive soils. This study focused on investigating the effects of a geopolymer
    mixture consisting of rice husk ash and metakaolin on various geotechnical properties
    of natural and admixed black cotton soil. Experimental tests were conducted by
    replacing the soil with varying proportions of the geopolymer blend, ranging from
    0% to 30% by weight. The findings consistently demonstrated that the incorporation
    of geopolymer as a soil stabilizer effectively enhanced the geotechnical properties
    of problematic soil. Moreover, geopolymer exhibits sustainable characteristics
    and cost-effectiveness, which can lead to cost savings in road construction projects.
