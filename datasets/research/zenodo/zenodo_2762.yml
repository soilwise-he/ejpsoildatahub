  title: "\xABSELECTION OF WINTER WHEAT AND RICE VARIETIES ADAPTED TO THE SOIL AND\
    \ CLIMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF KARAKALPAKSTAN\xBB"
  abstract: 'The effectiveness of grain production greatly depends on selecting the
    appropriate variety for the region and intended use of the grain. The cultivars
    differ from one another in yield, adaptability to local conditions, and reaction
    to stress factors since they each have unique features.


    The selection of grain types for the harsh conditions of Karakalpakstan was based
    on the aforementioned factors, and 10 varieties of winter wheat and 5 kinds of
    rice were chosen. Winter wheat types ASR and Antonina, ultra-ripe rice variations
    Gulistan, and late-ripening variety Iskander all differed in terms of winter hardiness,
    salt resistance, drought resistance, and eventually grain output.'
