  title: Isolation and Identification of Proteolytic Microorganisms from Soil
  abstract: The enzyme protease hydrolyses protein into peptides and amino acids.
    One of the major sources of protease producing bacterial strains is soil. A total
    of 30 soil samples were collected aseptically from Changanacherry, and brought
    to the laboratory. The samples were serially diluted and isolated using Nutrient
    Agar plates. Skim Agar media was used for the enumeration of protease producing
    microorganisms. The plates were incubated at 370C for 24-48 hours. The pure culture
    of 8 colonies exhibiting highest proteolytic activity was obtained by identifying
    the clear zones. After analysing the optimal growth conditions and antagonistic
    activities within the strains, 2 isolates were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity
    test towards twelve different antibiotics, microbiological characteristics, biochemical
    analysis and extracellular protease enzyme production. Among the 2 isolates, the
    one which exhibited highest protease production was identified as Bacillus thuringiensis
    using molecular methods. The results have increased the scope of finding industrially
    important bacteria from soil which can be used as monoculture or consortium for
    the degradation of waste on a large scale.
