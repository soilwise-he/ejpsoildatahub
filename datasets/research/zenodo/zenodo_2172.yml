  title: "Land cover and landform-based upscaling of soil organic carbon stocks on\
    \ the Br\xF8gger Peninsula, Svalbard"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;In this study we assess the total storage, landscape distribution,
    and vertical partitioning of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks on the Br&oslash;gger
    Peninsula, Svalbard. This type of high Arctic area is underrepresented in SOC
    databases for the northern permafrost region. Physico-chemical, elemental, and
    radiocarbon (14C) dating analyses were carried out on thirty-two soil profiles.
    Results were upscaled using both a land cover classification (LCC) and a landform
    classification (LFC). Both LCC and LFC approaches provide weighted mean SOC 0&ndash;100
    cm estimates for the study area of 1.0 &plusmn; 0.3 kg C m-2 (95% confidence interval)
    and indicate that about 68 percent of the total SOC storage occurs in the upper
    30 cm of the soil, and about 10 percent occurs in the surface organic layer. Furthermore,
    LCC and LFC upscaling approaches provide similar spatial SOC allocation estimates
    and emphasize the dominant role of &ldquo;vegetated area&rdquo; (4.2 &plusmn;
    1.6 kg C m-2) and &ldquo;solifluction slopes&rdquo; (6.7 &plusmn; 3.6 kg C m-2)
    in SOC 0&ndash;100 cm storage. LCC and LFC approaches report different and complementary
    information on the dominant processes controlling the spatial and vertical distribution
    of SOC in the landscape. There is no evidence for any significant SOC storage
    in the permafrost layer. We hypothesize, therefore, that the Br&oslash;gger Peninsula
    and similar areas of the high Arctic will become net carbon sinks, providing negative
    feedback on global warming in the future. The surface area that will have vegetation
    cover and incipient soil development will expand, whereas only small amounts of
    organic matter will experience increased decomposition due to active-layer deepening.&lt;/p&gt;'
