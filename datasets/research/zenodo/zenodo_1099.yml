  title: IDENTIFICATION OF CLAY MINERALS IN THE SOIL USING ATTERBERG LIMIT PARAMETERS
  abstract: Montmorillonite clay is a problematic soil for both geotechnical and pavement
    engineers. Therefore, identifying the presence of the expansive montmorillonite
    clay mineral within the soil matrix using a simple and inexpensive method is of
    paramount importance. This paper presents a simple method of identifying the primary
    clay minerals, namely kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite, in the soil matrix
    using Atterberg limits parameters, namely plasticity index, plastic limit, and
    slope of the fall cone curve (defined as 20/LL). The proposed methods can be used
    as a preliminary indicator method of identifying the presence of expansive clay
    minerals within the soil matrix before carrying out an expensive definitive method
    of identifying clay minerals, such as XRD
