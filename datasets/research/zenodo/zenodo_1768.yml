  title: Changes of Electrophoretic Spectra of Antioxidant Enzymes in Wheat Genotypes
    Subjected to Soil Drought
  abstract: Experiments with 6 contrasting bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum
    (Triticum durum Desf.) wheat genotypes grown under field conditions have been
    carried out to study the effect of soil drought on antioxidant enzyme activities.
    Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed the presence of 1 isoform
    of catalase, 6 isoforms of superoxide dismutase, 7 isoforms of ascorbate peroxidase
    and 7 isoforms of glutathione reductase in wheat leaves during drought. Mn-, Fe-,
    Cu/Zn containing isoforms of one of the key antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase-were
    shown to function in wheat plants. It was concluded that drought caused increases
    in APO, SOD, CAT and GR activities in wheat leaves compared with their initial
    levels. Increases in APO and GR activities were more pronounced, indicating an
    intense work of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, which breaks down H2O2.
