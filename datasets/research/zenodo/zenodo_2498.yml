  title: Carbon to nitrogen ratio and quantity of organic amendment interactively
    affect crop growth and soil mineral N retention
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Using organic amendments to improve&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/arable-land"&gt;arable
    soils&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in the long term is a careful balancing act of applying amendments
    with the right&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/carbon-to-nitrogen-ratio"&gt;carbon
    to nitrogen ratio&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(C:N ratio) at adequate quantity to avoid nitrogen
    (N) leaching while promoting or retaining crop growth in the short term. So far,
    most studies examining the relationship between C:N ratio and N mineralization
    and immobilization were done without plants. In this study we explored how&nbsp;&lt;a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/crop-biomass"&gt;crop
    biomass&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and N leaching change with increasing C:N ratio and quantity
    of organic amendments to arable soil. We conducted an open-air mesocosm experiment
    with organic amendments application across a range in C:N ratio (10 to 60) and
    quantity (10 to 50 ton ha-1) to sandy arable soil using a full-factorial design.
    Spring wheat was planted and grown for six months during which three rainfall
    events were simulated to test treatment effects on N leaching. Applying amendments
    with a C:N ratio of 20 and higher decreased crop biomass and increased mineral
    soil N, while amendments with a C:N ratio of 10 had the opposite effect. Applying
    larger quantities of amendments reinforced the effect of the C:N ratio on crop
    biomass. N leaching remained unaffected by either amendment C:N ratio or quantity
    or even&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/mineral-fertilizers"&gt;mineral
    fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;as N leaching only occurred in the control treatment
    without plants. Our results suggests that growing a crop is adequate to prevent
    N leaching. Applying organic amendments do not pose a different risk regarding
    N leaching when compared to mineral fertilizer and&nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/slurries"&gt;slurry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'
