  title: Soil Algae Of Class Chlorophyceae Of Gomel (Belarus) Streets Roadside Lawns
  abstract: "In this article presents the results of studying the composition of green\
    \ algae of class \u0421hlorophyceae soils of roadside lawns in some streets of\
    \ the city of Gomel.\n\nResearch methods: field, laboratory and culture.\n\nIn\
    \ total 20 species of green algae belonging to 12 genera, 9 families, 4 orders\
    \ of class \u0421hlorophyceae were identified. Algae of the order of Volvocales\
    \ and Protosiphonales predominated (30% each). Algae of the order of Chroococcales\
    \ accounted for 25%, Scenedesmales accounted for 15%. Among the families the largest\
    \ number of species characterized Chlamydomonadaceae (30%). Less represented were\
    \ Chlorosarcinaceaea and Chlorococcaceae (20% each). The families Actinochloridaceae,\
    \ Neospongiococcaceae, Cylindrocapsaceae, Bracteacoccaceae, Oocystaceae, Scenedesmaceae\
    \ included 1 species.\n\nEcological analysis showed that all the Chlorophycea\u0441\
    ea detected are edaphophilic. Most species were representatives of the Ch\u2013\
    life form (62%). Less represented in the spectrum of life forms were species of\
    \ C\u2013 and X\u2013forms (27% and 11%).\n\nIt is shown that as the transport\
    \ load decreases, an increase in the amount of Chlorophycea\u0441ea in lawn grass\
    \ occurs due to the expansion of the Chlorococcales order in the groupings. In\
    \ the soil of almost all the streets, there is a tendency to expand the species\
    \ richness of Chlorophycea\u0441ea with increasing distance from the roadway.\n\
    \nOn all sites the prevalence of algae of the Ch\u2013life form remained. At the\
    \ same time, as the intensity of the transport load decreases, an increase in\
    \ the number of Ch\u2013form species is noted, which is related to the expansion\
    \ of the species composition of algae of less disturbed sites. At most sites in\
    \ 5 m from the roadway, an increase in the proportion of algae of the C\u2013\
    life form in the spectra is noted, which is associated with an improvement in\
    \ the conditions for algae: an increase in soil moisture and a certain decrease\
    \ in the effect of exhaust gases."
