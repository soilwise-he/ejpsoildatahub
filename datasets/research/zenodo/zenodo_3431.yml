  title: Comparative Analysis Of Selected Stabilization Agents For Subgrade Soil
  abstract: 'The lateritic soil which is the major material used in road construction
    sometimes may be unsuitable which leads to failure of the pavement profiles. This
    study therefore evaluated the use of hydrated lime, cement and bitumen in stabilizing
    lateritic soil. Lateritic soil samples were collected from proximal four (4) different
    borrow pits namely Odookun-Igbeti (OI), Gbemi-Igbeti (GI), Isafa-Kisi (IK), Yoyin-Kisi
    (YK) along Igbeti-Kisi Road, Oyo State, Nigeria. The stabilized soil mixture was
    prepared by using 2, 4, 6 and 8% hydrated lime, cement and bitumen by weight of
    soil samples, while the unstabilized sample served as control. The unstabilized
    and stabilized samples were subjected to Specific Gravity (SG), Particle Size
    Analysis (PSA), Liquid Limit (LL), Plastic Limit (PL), Maximum Dry Density (MDD),
    Optimum Moisture Content (OMC), and unsoaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR), in
    accordance with British Standard BS 1377: 1990. The SG and PSA values for the
    unstabilized samples obtained from OI, GI, IS and YK were 2.28, 2.41, 2.22, 2.47
    and 35.14, 33.78, 41.10, 41.04%. LL and PL values were 33, 33, 19, 34% and 22,
    17, 23, 14%, respectively. The corresponding MDD, OMC and unsoaked CBR were: 1.79,
    1.90, 1.72, and 1.81 g/cm3, 15.0, 15.5, 18.9, 13.3%, and 18, 11, 4, 17%, respectively.
    The corresponding ranges of values for stabilized samples for the varying percentage
    of the stabilizing agents were: Lime: LL (33 - 36, 33 - 42, 39 - 43, 34 - 42%);
    PL (19 - 26, 17 - 27, 23 - 28, 14 -27%); MDD (1.67 - 1.95, 1.79 - 1.95, 1.64 -
    1.76, 1.63 - 1.92 g/cm3); OMC (11.4 - 15.0, 11.0 -15.5, 11.5 - 18.9, 9.0 - 13.3
    %); and CBR (48, 43, 17, 30%), respectively. For Cement: LL (33 -38, 33 - 38,
    39 - 48, 34 - 48 %); PL (21 - 26, 17 - 26, 23 - 32, 14 - 30%); MDD (1.76 - 1.88,
    1.76 - 1.90, 1.72 - 1.94, 1.73 - 1.82 g/cm3); OMC (10.9 - 15.0, 12.5 - 16.6, 12.6
    - 18.9, 9.0 - 13.3 %); and CBR (45, 39, 29,31%), respectively. While for Bitumen:
    LL (30 - 34, 29 - 34, 38 - 41, 34 -38%); PL (17 - 24, 13 - 23, 17 - 24, 14 - 26%);
    MDD (1.67 - 1.95, 1.73 - 1.93, 1.72 - 1.93, 1.68 -1.92 g/cm3); OMC (11.4 - 15.0,
    9.0 - 15.5, 13.0 - 18.9, 9.0 - 13.3%); and CBR (56, 41, 20, 25%), respectively.
    The study has shown that lateritic soil samples obtained from the four sites required
    stabilization based on geotechnical properties, hence the stability of the laterite
    soil samples were enhanced with hydrated lime, cement and bitumen'
