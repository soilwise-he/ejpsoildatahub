  title: Analyses of some Engineering Properties of Isan - Ekiti Soil, Southwestern
    Nigeria
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Today, all over the World, soil plays major role in Civil Engineering
    works or construction. Its thorough assessment is impossible if its Engineering
    properties were overlooked. The aim of this study is to analyze some Engineering
    properties of lateritic soil deposited in Isan - Ekiti, South western Nigeria.
    Soil samples collected from the study area were subjected to Atterberg Limits,
    CBR and Grain Size laboratory tests. It is observed that the LL, PL, PI, SL and
    CBR values varied from varied from 41.10 to 57.50 , 24.60 to 35.50 , 14.80 to
    22.70 , 0.32 to 0.61 and 4.38 to 30.21 respectively for all the soil samples.
    It could be generally observed all the soil samples were classified as granular
    soil material with mainly silty or clayey gravel and sand constituent materials
    with some stone fragments. Their general rating as sub grade materials is &quot;Excellent
    to good&quot;. They were grouply classified as A - 2 - 7 and were only good for
    sub grade filling materials. There is need for further study on deposited materials
    around the study area for good base and sub base courses materials. Adeyemi E.
