  title: Soil Fertility Status Of Mulberry (Morus Alba L.)Soils Under Bivoltine Sericultural
    Areas Of North, South And Eastern Regions Of Karnataka.
  abstract: Soil analysis based prescription to suitable amelioration of mulberry
    gardens for enhanced quality leaf and bivoltine cocoon production is the priority
    of sericulture industry in Karnataka. With the above objective in the present
    study a total of 2067 composite soil samples were collected from traditional sericultural
    vicinity under 13 districts situated in North (1066), South (855) and Eastern
    (146) parts of Karnataka and subjected for their chemical analysis. The soil samples
    were characterized and analysed for their soil type, reaction (pH), salinity (EC)
    and nutrient status like available nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K),
    sulphur (S) and boron (B), respectively. The soils received were observed to be
    52% were loamy (clay), 28% red, 12% black and 8% lateritic indicating that large
    numbers of soils are most suitable for mulberry cultivation. In regard to the
    soil reaction and salinity status, 59% of the soils showed desired optimal category
    of pH (6.5-7.5) for mulberry, 18% acidic (&lt;6.5) and 23% were of very high pH
    (&gt;7.5). Electrical conductivity (EC) was normal with desirable soil salinity
    in 99% soils indicating congenial for mulberry (&lt;1.0dS/m2). Organic carbon
    (OC) was low (&lt;0.65%) in 76% soils, 23% desirable range (0.65-1.0%) whereas
    negligible number of soils showed higher OC content (&gt;1.0%) alarming that maximum
    soils were falling under low fertility category. Available Nitrogen (N2O) and
    Phosphorous (P2O5) was recorded low (&lt;250kg/ha; &lt;15kg/ha) in 98% and 45%
    samples. Medium level (15-25kg/ha) of, P2O5 was recorded in 23% soils and higher
    side (&gt;25kg/ha) in 32% samples. Optimal range (120-240kg/ha) of available Potassium
    (K2O) was recorded in 49%, low (&lt;120kg/ha) in 20% and 31% soil showed high
    level (&gt;240kg/ha). Available Sulphur (S) was recorded high (&gt;15ppm) in 54%
    soils followed by 41% desired level (10-15ppm), whereas mere 5% soils shown low
    level (&lt;10) of sulphur. In case of available Boron (B) 44% soils recorded as
    low (&lt;0.5ppm), 43% are desired level (0.5-1.0), whereas 13% soils exhibited
    high content of available Boron
