  title: Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI);
    21-year drought monitoring in Iran using satellite imagery within Google Earth
    Engine
  abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring, especially
    in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent <em>in-situ</em> multi-temporal
    datasets. In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil
    Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our
    knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in
    its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional
    RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VHI, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation
    and soil temperature <em>in-situ</em> data have been used. Different time scales
    of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been
    used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly
    precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively.
    The correlation coefficients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07
    to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses.
    Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs,
    all spatiotemporal drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI
    over the past 21 years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and
    Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were
    used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the
    results, Iran experienced the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI
    value lasting for almost two years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value
    equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity
    and trend in the 31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various
    levels of decrease over the 21 years were found for different provinces, while
    Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with
    a 0.004% and 0.002% trendline slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying
    drought prevalence that occurred in several years. In summary, this study provides
    updated information about drought trends in Iran using an advanced and efficient
    RSDI implemented in the cloud computing GEE platform. These results are beneficial
    for decision-makers and officials responsible for environmental sustainability,
    agriculture and the effects of climate change.
