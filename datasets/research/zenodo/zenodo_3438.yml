  title: Agricultural Land-Use Effects on Soil Cation Exchange Capacity, Organic Carbon
    and Total Nitrogen in Soil Aggregate Sized Fractions in Ile-Ife, Nigeria
  abstract: "The study determined the distribution of organic carbon (OC), cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC) and total nitrogen (TN) associated with soil aggregates\
    \ across land-use types in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Six agricultural land-use types were\
    \ considered which were undisturbed secondary forest, continuously cropped land,\
    \ paddock, oil palm, cocoa and teak plantations at the Teaching and Research Farm,\
    \ Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Soils samples were randomly collected\
    \ from each land use at 0-15 and 15-30cm soil depths in three replicates. The\
    \ samples were segregated into four aggregate classes; &lt;63\xB5m, 63-250\xB5\
    m, 250\xB5m-1mm and 1-2mm respectively. The following analyses were carried out\
    \ on the whole soil: particle size distribution, soil pH, CEC, OC and TN while\
    \ CEC, OC and TN were carried out on different soil aggregate fractions. Data\
    \ obtained were subjected to analysis of variance using SAS software and means\
    \ were separated using Duncan\u2019s Multiple Range Test at p \u22640.05. Results\
    \ showed that OC, TN and CEC were more associated with smaller sized soil aggregates\
    \ (&lt;250\xB5m) across all the land-use types, except under oil palm plantation,\
    \ which had most of its SOC associated with 1-2mm sized soil aggregate. In the\
    \ whole soil, continuously cultivated land had the least OC and TN while secondary\
    \ forest surprisingly had the least CEC. The study revealed that aggregate size\
    \ &lt;250\xB5m contributes the most to soil nutrient available. Therefore, conservative\
    \ land-use practices (such as conservative tillage, mulching, manuring etc.) that\
    \ protect the loss of soil micro-aggregates (&lt;250\xB5m) especially to erosion\
    \ should be adopted for sustainable land-use."
