  title: Geotechnical Properties of Soil Stabilized with Blended Binders for Sustainable
    Road Base Applications
  abstract: This study aimed at evaluating the effect of blended binders on the stabilization
    of clayey soils intended for use as road and pavement materials in selected regions
    of Sweden. The stabilization potential of blended binders containing five stabilizers
    (cement, bio fly ash, energy fly ash, slag and lime) was investigated using laboratory
    tests and statistical analysis. Soil samples were compacted using Swedish Standards
    on UCS. The specimens were stabilized with blended mixtures containing various
    ratios of five binders. The effects of changed ratio of binders on soil strength
    was analyzed using velocities of seismic P-waves penetrating the tested soil samples
    on the day 14 of the experiment. The difference in the soil surface response indicated
    variations in strength in the evaluated specimens. We tested combination of blended
    binders to improve the stabilization of clayey soil. The mix of slag/lime or slag/cement
    accelerated soil hardening process and gave durable soil product. We noted that
    pure lime (burnt or quenched) is best suited for the fine-grained soils containing
    clay minerals. Slag used in this study had a very finely ground structure and
    had hydraulic properties (hardens under water) without activation. Therefore,
    slag has a too slow curing process for it to be practical to use in real projects
    on stabilization of roads. The best performance on soil stabilization was demonstrated
    by blended binders consisted of lime / fly ash / cement which considerably improved
    the geotechnical properties and workability of soil and increased its strength.
    We conclude that bearing capacities of soil intended for road construction can
    be significantly improved by stabilization using mixed binders, compared to pure
    binders (cement).
