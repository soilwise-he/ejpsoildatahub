  title: Cultivated Land Use Zoning Based on Soil Function Evaluation from the Perspective
    of Black Soil Protection
  abstract: Given that cultivated land serves as a strategic resource to ensure national
    food security, blind emphasis on improvement of food production capacity can lead
    to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Therefore, we took Heilongjiang
    province as an example to conduct a multi-functional evaluation of soil at the
    provincial scale. A combination of soil, climate, topography, land use, and remote
    sensing data were used to evaluate the functions of primary productivity, provision
    and cycling of nutrients, provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity,
    water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation of
    cultivated land in 2018. We designed a soil function discriminant matrix, constructed
    the supply-demand ratio, and evaluated the current status of supply and demand
    of soil functions. Soil functions demonstrated a distribution pattern of high
    grade in the northeast and low grade in the southwest, mostly in second-level
    areas. The actual supply of primary productivity functions in 71.32% of the region
    cannot meet the current needs of the population. The dominant function of soil
    in 34.89% of the area is water purification and regulation, and most of the cultivated
    land belongs to the functional balance region. The results presented herein provide
    a theoretical basis for optimization of land patterns and improvement of cultivated
    land use management on a large scale, and is of great significance to the sustainable
    use of black soil resources and improvement of comprehensive benefits
