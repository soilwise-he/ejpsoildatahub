  title: Biodegradation Of Plastics By Pseudomonas Putida Isolated From Garden Soil
    Samples
  abstract: An attempt was made to isolate Pseudomonas putida from garden soil samples
    and to characterize its degrading ability on plastic material. This work reveals
    that the garden soil is a good source of microbes capable of degrading plastic
    materials. P. putida have the ability to convert the complex plastic material
    was determined in terms of weight loss of the material. It degrades the plastic
    material up to 75.3% within a month. The plastic samples tested in this study
    were polythene bag, plastic bag, plastic cup and milk cover. Among the plastic
    samples, milk cover was found to be more degradative (75.3%) plastic material.
