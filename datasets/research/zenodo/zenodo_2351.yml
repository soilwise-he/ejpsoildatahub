  title: Evaluating The Effect Of Lateral Soil Movement Rate On The Behavior Of Piles
    In Sand Using Plaxis
  abstract: "Pile foundations are not only used to support heavy structures and can\
    \ act in the dual role of carrying the applied load to deeper and strong layers,\
    \ but also to resist lateral loads generated from many sources as well as earthquake,\
    \ earth pressure, waves, wind and soil movement due to creeping slop or excavation\
    \ works.\n\n \n\nPiles response to external effects is divided into a passive\
    \ pile and active pile. When the piles are subjected to lateral soil movements,\
    \ these piles are known as passive piles. On the other hand, active piles referred\
    \ to a pile subjected to external vertical and/or horizontal force.\n\n \n\nSoil\
    \ movement is encountered in practice when piles are placed in an unstable slope,\
    \ landslides, adjacent to deep excavation, tunnel operation, marginally stable\
    \ riverbank with high fluctuating water level and also in piles supporting bridge\
    \ abutment adjacent to approach embankments.\n\n \n\nPLAXIS 3D 2013 geotechnical\
    \ finite element package which present 3- dimensional analysis for soil was utilized\
    \ to build a numerical model of single pile and pile groups in lateral soil movement\
    \ with different soil movement rates. The model confirmed using previous researches.\
    \ The model verification shows favorable agreement with the measured horizontal\
    \ pile deflections and bending moments by choosing appropriate parameters. \n\n\
    \ \n\nResults from three-dimensional finite element show that high soil movement\
    \ rates gave high horizontal displacement and bending moment then the lower rates.\
    \ Also, the increasing of soil movement rate has more impact on the behavior of\
    \ the single pile compared with the effect on pile groups under the same rate."
