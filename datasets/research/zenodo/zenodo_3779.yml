  title: THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE SOIL ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT IN
    BRAZILIAN CERRADO
  abstract: "Were quantified the plant residues on the soil, total soil organic carbon\
    \ (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) contents and the different soil organic matte (SOM)\
    \ fractions and to determine 13C and 15N isotopic soil composition and plant residues\
    \ in the crop\u2013livestock integration system (CLIS), pasture and Cerrado areas,\
    \ in Goias, Brazil. TOC and TN, C and N light organic matter content (C-LOM/NLOM);\
    \ C and N of particulate organic matter (C-POM/N-POM); and mineral organic matter\
    \ (CMOM/N-MOM) were evaluated. \u03B4 13C and \u03B415N of soil and LOM, POM,\
    \ and MOM fractions, as well as the \u03B413C of plant residues, were also determined.\
    \ Plant residues from pasture were more enriched with nutrients and C, and CLIS\
    \ which are richer in N. \u03B413C of pasture and CLIS soils indicated that the\
    \ C from the Cerrado vegetation (typically C3) was replaced by vegetation with\
    \ C4 photosynthetic mechanisms. CLIS accumulated more TOC than the pasture, and\
    \ provided higher C-MOM and N-MOM values than pasture, and higher N-LOM levels\
    \ than pasture and Cerrado. \u03B4 13C of LOM is associated with more recent origins\
    \ of carbon. \u03B415N of POM and soil of the CLIS and pasture indicate greater\
    \ mineralization of SOM."
