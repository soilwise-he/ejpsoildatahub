  title: The Changing of Soil Reaction and Exchangeable Aluminum on two Different
    Soil Order due to Dolomite Application
  abstract: "<strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong>\u2014</strong> <em>The objective\
    \ of the experiment was to know the effect of Dolomite application on soil reaction\
    \ and exchangeable Aluminum in two different soil orders. The method was experimental\
    \ using Factorial Randomized Block Design, which consists of two Factors. The\
    \ First factor were soil orders consist two levels, i.e. T1= Ultisols Kentrong,\
    \ dan T2 = Inseptisols Jatinangor, while the second were dolomite dosages, consist\
    \ four levels, i.e. dO = 0 ton</em><em> ha<sup>-1</sup>, d1 = 1 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>,\
    \ d2 = 2 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>, d3 = 3 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>, d4 = 4 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>.The\
    \ result of the experiment showed that on Ultisols Kentrong, dolomite applications\
    \ significantly increased the value of soil reaction (pH) after two weeks incubation.\
    \ The treatment of 3 ton/ha showed pH 4.73 or 8 % higher that control. Otherwise,\
    \ the applications of dolomite also decreased the exchangeable Aluminum. The treatment\
    \ of 3 ton/ha showed value 7.01 of exchangeable aluminum or 21 % lower than control.\
    \ In Inceptisols Jatinangor, dolomite applications increased the value of soil\
    \ reaction (pH) after two weeks incubation and the treatment of 3 tonha<sup>-1</sup>showed\
    \ pH 5.83 or 11 % higher than control. Otherwise, the application of dolomite\
    \ decreased the exchangeable aluminum although were not significantly different\
    \ for that parameters in this soil order. Based on statistical analysis, it proved\
    \ that liming unable applied effectively on whole soil types or orders due to\
    \ its relation with the level of soil acidity.</em>"
