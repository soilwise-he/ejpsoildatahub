  title: 'Evaluation of pedotransfer functions for predicting soil hydraulic properties:
    A voyage from regional to field scales across Europe'
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Study region: Europe. A total of 660, 522, and 4940 soil samples
    belonging to GRIZZLY, HYPRES,&lt;br&gt;

    and EU-HYDI databases, respectively, were used for parametric evaluation.&lt;br&gt;

    Study focus: The soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions are
    crucial input information&lt;br&gt;

    for land surface models. Determining these functions by using direct methods is&lt;br&gt;

    hampered by excessive time and unaffordable costs required for field activities
    and laboratory&lt;br&gt;

    analyses. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are widely-used indirect techniques enabling
    soil hydraulic&lt;br&gt;

    properties to be predicted by using easily-retrievable soil information. In a
    parametric&lt;br&gt;

    evaluation, the predictive capability of PTFs is examined by comparing measured
    and estimated&lt;br&gt;

    soil water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Yet information
    about the&lt;br&gt;

    performance of PTFs for specific modeling applications is mandatory to evaluate
    PTF effectiveness&lt;br&gt;

    in greater depth. This approach is commonly defined as functional evaluation.&lt;br&gt;

    New hydrological insights for the region: The best performing four PTFs selected
    in the parametric&lt;br&gt;

    evaluations are tested under two functional evaluations. The first encompasses
    a spatial interpolation&lt;br&gt;

    with a geostatistical technique, whereas the second employs Hydrus-1D to simulate
    the&lt;br&gt;

    water balance components along an experimental transect. Our results reinforce
    and integrate the&lt;br&gt;

    insights of previous studies about the use of a PTF, and highlight the ability,
    or inability, of this&lt;br&gt;

    technique to adequately reproduce the observed spatial variability of soil hydraulic
    properties&lt;br&gt;

    and simulated water fluxes.&lt;/p&gt;'
