  title: Prediction of Crop Yield Based-on Soil Moisture using Machine Learning Algorithms
  abstract: Agriculture planning is playing an important role as the economic growth
    is very high day by day in our daily life. There is lot of research study going
    on as there are few important issues like soil nutrients, crop prediction, farming
    system, crop monitoring in agriculture with modern farming system. Based on various
    parameters, farming issues and farming system, there is lot of change in production
    rate and market prices. Crop prediction and crop monitoring is main factor to
    produce good quality of crops for farmers to predict crop yield based on soil
    moisture. Prediction of crop yield includes forecasting factors like temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, etc., and crop yield based on soil moisture includes few measures
    like pH, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and potassium) values using various sensors.
    Farmers can predict or come to a decision the type of soil moisture values, farmers
    can decide the type of crop to be planted. In this paper, we proposed decision
    tree supervised machine learning algorithm to improve our results for the prediction
    of crop yield based on soil moisture parameters to achieve economic growth for
    achievement of better results.
