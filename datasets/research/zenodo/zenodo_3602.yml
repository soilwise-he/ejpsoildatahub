  title: "Efficacy Of Terrazyme \u2013A Bio Enzyme On Strength Characteristics Of\
    \ Expansive Soil"
  abstract: In India vast area is occupied by black cotton soil mainly contains clay
    as chief constituent. They show minimal bearing capacity and low strength. These
    soils swell when comes in contact with water and shrink as they dry out. Engineers
    face problems with such type of soils, which do not posses sufficient strength
    to carry the imposed loads during construction and the life of the structure.
    Properties of the soil must be increased to achieve economy and to improve the
    performance of structure. Soil stabilization is the process of reducing undesirable
    behaviour of expansive soils. Conventional stabilization methods are time consuming
    and are proved to be not economical, it become necessary to look for alternative
    eco-friendly stabilizers like bio-enzymes. Different types of bio-enzymes available
    for soil stabilization are Renolith, Permazyme, Terrazyme and Fujibeton. The present
    study deals the effect of Terrazyme a bio-enzyme on shear strength and CBR value
    of expansive soil. Laboratory tests were conducted on various dosages, stabilizer
    was added by replacing 1, 2, 3 and 4 percentages of the optimum water content
    of the black cotton soil
