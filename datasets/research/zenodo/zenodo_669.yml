  title: Impact of soil use on aggregate stability and its relationship with soil
    organic carbon at two different altitudes in the Colombian Andes
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&shy;This study examined the conditions of soil aggregate stability
    expressed as a distribution of the size classes of stable aggregates (SA) and
    of the mean weighted diameter of the stable aggregates (MWD). To correlate these
    characteristics with the soil organic carbon (OC), we measured the particulate
    organic matter pool (POC), the OC associated with the mineral organic matter pool
    (HOC), the total organic carbon content (TOC), and the humification rate (HR).
    Soils were sampled at two altitudes: 1) Humic Dystrudepts in a cold tropical climate
    (CC) with three plots: tropical mountain rainforest, pastures, and crops; 2) Fluvaquentic
    Dystrudepts in a warm tropical climate (WC) with three plots: tropical rainforest,
    an association of oil palm and pastures, and irrigated rice. Soils were sampled
    at three depths: 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm. Th&shy;e physical properties, mineral
    particle size distribution, and bulk density were measured.&lt;/p&gt;'
