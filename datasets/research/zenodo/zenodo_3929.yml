  title: Topographic Characterization And Mapping Of Soil Erosion In The Diarha Watershed
    Using Rusle, Rs And Gis.
  abstract: Mapping of erosive risk is a prerequisite in an erosion control approach.
    It makes it possible to locate the sectors most vulnerable to erosive processes.
    The establishment of the erosive risk map results from the spatialization of the
    Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (Rusle). This equation is combined with Geographic
    Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing techniques to estimate and map average
    rates of soil loss. This study was conducted in the Diarha watershed and its sub-basins
    to determine their morphometric characteristics and map the main factors involved
    in soil erosion processes. The results showed that soil erosion risk varies according
    to the topographic and climatic gradients of the watershed. The Diarha catchment
    area covers an area of 759.3 km?. Its compactness index of 1.5 indicates an elongated
    shape SE-NW. The altitudes vary from 576 m in the South to 55 m in the North with
    an average of 315.5 m. The LS topographic factor varies from 0 to 30. Potential
    soil losses vary between 0 and 1873 t/ha/year depending on the sector. The assessment
    yielded an average of 36.4t/ha/year and a standard deviation of 105.3t/ha/year.
    Annual soil losses in the entire Diarha catchment area are estimated at 31.882t/year;
    with a specific degradation of 42t/km?/year.
