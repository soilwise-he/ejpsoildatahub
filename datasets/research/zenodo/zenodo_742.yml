  title: 'Global assessment of soil pollution: The need for standardized methods'
  abstract: "Reliable analysis and quantification of components in soil is essential\
    \ in order to determine if the soil is \u2018fit for purpose\u2019. Soil provides\
    \ the basis for our existence, but not all soils can be used for every purpose.\
    \ This is sometimes obvious, but often it is necessary to characterize the soil\
    \ in order to identify what soil use is possible. For agricultural use, domestic\
    \ housing, recreation or industries, just to mention a few, specific soil conditions\
    \ apply and often governmental regulations are in place. Reliable characterization\
    \ methods are therefore of major importance. Standardization of such reliable\
    \ methods is the objective of the European standardization committee CEN/TC 444\
    \ \u2013 Environmental characterization of solid matrices and the worldwide standardization\
    \ committee ISO/TC 190 \u2013 Soil quality."
