  title: Simulating with a combination of RUSLE GIS and sediment delivery ratio for
    soil restoration
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Erosion by water is the main cause of land degradation.
    Landscapes degraded by erosion need to be restored in many respects, and particularly
    in terms of ecosystem services. From an economic and management perspective, care
    is needed to select priority areas and determine the means to be applied to restore
    them. Globally, the model most commonly used to produce scenarios for the prevention
    of soil losses is the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). This study
    of the subbasin of the Sulakyurt &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dam Basin in Turkey
    aims (1) to identify the distribution of soil losses over time and by location,
    and (2) to grade the priority areas for the prevention of soil losses by means
    of a simulation. The average potential soil losses in the area under study are
    estimated at 42.35 t ha&minus; 1 year&minus;1, and the average actual losses at
    39.49 t ha&minus; 1 year-1. According to the simulation,27.61% of the study area
    (2782 ha) is of the highest priority for soil restoration. In our study, forests
    have the highest soil losses, which is contrary to the natural protection that
    forests provide against erosion. The high rates are due to the slope, the forest
    area is very steep. So it is the slope factor that outweighs the vegetation cover
    factor. Of the forest areas, 41.74% (1766 ha) falls within the areas of highest
    priority. The study serves as a guide for landscape planning and the determination
    of erosion risk in restoration efforts, and for identifying the methods to be
    adopted during the restoration work to reduce the loss of soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'
