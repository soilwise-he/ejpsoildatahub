  title: Soil Moisture Testing Using Bluetooth Based Data Collector Robot
  abstract: Soil testing is an important process in<br> agriculture, environmental
    monitoring, and civil<br> engineering. However, traditional soil testing methods<br>
    are time- consuming and labor- intensive. In this paper,<br> we propose a Bluetooth-controlled
    soil testing robot<br> that can automate the soil testing process. The robot is<br>
    equipped with a soil sensor and a Bluetooth module,<br> which allows it to communicate
    with a smart phone<br> app. The app can control the movement of the robot and<br>
    receive real-time data from the sensor. We also present<br> the design and implementation
    of the robot, including<br> the hardware and software components. Finally, we<br>
    evaluate the performance of the robot in different soil<br> types and compare
    it with traditional soil testing<br> methods.
