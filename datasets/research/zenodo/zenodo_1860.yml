  title: Effect of Inorganic and Organic Fertilisers on Yield and Soil Nutrient Status
    of Walnut Orchard
  abstract: "&lt;p&gt;The present study was aimed to determine the effect of integrated\
    \ application of inorganic and organic fertilisers on nut yield and soil nutrient\
    \ status of walnut orchard under temperate region of India (Kashmir) during year\
    \ 2011 and 2012. The experiment consisted of four selections [SKAU/002 (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),\
    \ SKAU/008 (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), SKAU/024 (S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and\
    \ SKAU/040 (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] of walnut and six mineral \_treatments\
    \ [T&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;(100% NPK recommended as per package of practices),\
    \ T&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;{100% through manure (FYM 50% + vermicompost 25% +\
    \ poultry manure 25%)}, T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (75% NPK inorganic fertilizers\
    \ + 25% FYM), T&lt;sub&gt;4 &lt;/sub&gt;(75% NPK inorganic fertilizers + 25% vermicompost),\
    \ T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (75% NPK\_ inorganic fertilizers + 25% poultry manure)\
    \ and T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; {75% NPK inorganic fertilizers + 25% manure (1/3\
    \ FYM + 1/3 vermicompost + 1/3 poultry manure)} replicated five times and three\
    \ trees in each replication in Factorial Randomized Block Design. All fertilizers\
    \ and manures were applied in the first week of December beneath the tree canopy\
    \ and mixed well with soil. Maximum yield 6.82 kg/tree and nut weight, 13.66 g\
    \ in selection SKAU/024 were obtained with the application of 75% NPK through\
    \ inorganic fertilizers + 25% through vermicompost .Combined application improved\
    \ soil nutrient status. Highest available nitrogen (338.59 kg/ha), phosphorus\
    \ (20.80 kg/ha) and calcium (1312.25ppm), available zinc (1.19 ppm), manganese\
    \ (66.66 ppm), iron (55.95 ppm) and copper content (2.74 ppm) was found in treatment\
    \ 75% NPK through inorganic fertilizers + 25% through vermicompost, whereas, maximum\
    \ available potassium (259.27 kg/ha) and magnesium (268.86 ppm) was observed in\
    \ treatment \_{100% through manure (FYM 50% + vermicompost 25% + poultry manure\
    \ 25%)}.. The application of 75% fertilizer through inorganic coupled with 25%\
    \ vermicompost enhanced yield as well as soil nutrient status followed by treatment\
    \ 75% fertilizer through inorganic coupled with 25% poultry manure.&lt;/p&gt;"
