  title: Impact of microplastics and aged microplastics on the toxicity of emerging
    contaminants in the soil
  abstract: 'Microplastics (MP) are ubiquitous in all parts of the ecosystem and have
    recently been proven to impact the toxicity of other environmental pollutants
    significantly. Most of the existing studies were conducted with aquatic organisms
    and focused on the effect of MPs on metal toxicity. Moreover, aged MPs, which
    are more environmental relevant structures of MPs, are rarely investigated in
    terms of toxicity. Oxygen-containing groups formed by aging increase MPs'' charge,
    hydrophilicity, and polarity, affecting MP-organic pollutant binding. Hence, the
    impacts of MPs and aged MPs on the toxicity of organic emerging pollutants on
    soil organisms are lacking in the literature. This study aims to investigate the
    toxic effect of selected emerging organic pollutants on soil organism E. crypticus,
    in the presence of polypropene (PP) MPs and aged PP MPs. Selected emerging contaminants
    were diclofenac, ciprofloxacin, EE2, diuron, terbutryn, anthracene, diphenyl ether
    and diethyl hexyl phthalate. Toxicity was investigated for the reproduction end
    point, and NOEC and EC50 values were reported. PP and aged PP were added to the
    sets at a 5mg/kg concentration. It was found that microplastics alone did not
    show any effect on the reproduction of E. crypticus at this concentration, but
    they significantly increased the toxicity of organic pollutants. The individual
    NOEC value for microplastics and pollutants was 12.5mg/kg. In the presence of
    microplastics and aged microplastics, the pollutants were shown to have a significant
    effect at this concentration. The EC50 values of pollutants also decreased in
    the presence of MPs. Although the existing concentrations of the emerging contaminants
    in the soil is much lower than 12.5 mg/kg, the presence of PP and aged PP should
    be considered for the environmental risk management of organic emerging contaminants
    in the soil due to their potential to alter the reproduction toxicity. Also see:
