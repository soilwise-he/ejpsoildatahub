  title: "Factors Affecting Farmer\u2019s Adoption of Soil and Water  Conservation\
    \ Practice in Case of Gode District, Shebelle Zone, Somali Region, Ethiopia"
  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Data for this study were gathered through focus groups, questionnaires,
    and interviews with family heads, district agricultural offices, and development
    agents (DAs). The most significant and positive factors that positively and significantly
    influenced the outcome of the logistic regression model were age, sex, the slope
    of the farm land, the intention of the household heads to sustain farming, training,
    and extension services. Furthermore, household heads who had access to training
    and extension services were 2.619 and 5.674 times more likely to adopt SWC structures
    than those who had no access to these services, respectively. The household heads
    who had the intention to sustain the activities of farming and People who farmed
    on steep slopes had a 1.996 and 6.116 times higher likelihood of implementing
    SWC structures than those who did not have these characteristics, respectively.
    Inversely, increasing accessibility to finance services, farming extent, and involvement
    in non-farm pursuits reduced by (-1.371), (-1.390), and (-4.132) times the probability
    of adopting SWC structures, According to the study''s findings, age, sex, slope,
    motive, travel distance, training outside of farming activities, and the availability
    of extension services were the main determinants of farmers'' adoption of SWC
    methods. Hence, in order to successfully address the challenges of adoption of
    SWC practices in the study area, it is advised that non-governmental organisations,
    the district agricultural office, and other stakeholders take into consideration
    the obstacles that prevent farmers from adopting SWC practices&lt;/p&gt;'
