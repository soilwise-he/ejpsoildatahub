  title: 'Soil-Recycled Aggregate-Geopolymer Road Base/Subbase Mixtures: Steps Towards
    Sustainability'
  abstract: This study deals with the development of Soil-Geopolymer mixtures using
    flyash, alkali activator and recycled aggregates (RAG) including recycled concrete
    (RCA) and reclaimed asphalt (RAP) as an alternative to soil-cement for pavement
    base and subbase layers. Several mix constituents were varied such as flyash type
    and content, RCA and RAP content and ratio of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide.
    Experiment design was established and mechanical and durability characteristics
    of Soil-RAG-Geopolymer mixtures were evaluated and then compared to the conventional
    soil-cement mixtures. The results of the testing showed that for the selected
    Soil-RAG-Geopolymer mixtures the strength, stiffness, permanent deformation, and
    durability characteristics were either comparable or better than the soil-cement
    mixtures. However, such mixtures required more curing time at room temperature
    to achieve needed strength. In order to further optimize the practical applications
    of this technology in the field, other variables such as molarity of alkali activator,
    curing conditions, early strength development at room and ambient temperatures,
    gradation of RAG and shrinkage characteristics need be investigated.
