  title: ISOLATION, PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIBACTERIAL PEPTIDE FROM
    SOIL IN PANVEL REGION
  abstract: "Microbes contend for the limited space and nutrients present in natural\
    \ ecological niches, thus they've<br> developed several strategies in order to\
    \ survive. Production of \u2018antimicrobial peptide\u2019 best known as<br> \u2018\
    Bacteriocin\u2019 is one of them. Bacteriocins extensively distributed in nature\
    \ which are synthesized by bacteria.<br> The present study was carried out to\
    \ estimate naturally synthesized antimicrobial peptides and their<br> capacities\
    \ to inhibit Gram-positive pathogenic organisms. Ten bacterial spp. were isolated\
    \ and screened to<br> produce antimicrobial peptide. Antimicrobial peptide produced\
    \ by two of bacterial strains showed the most<br> significant antimicrobial activity\
    \ against Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteriocins have shown significant<br> activity\
    \ at 370 with pH 7 Proteolytic enzymes verified the proteinaceous nature of antimicrobial\
    \ peptides.<br> These partially purified bacteriocins can be further used as antimicrobial\
    \ agent or it can be used as food<br> complements to control food borne pathogens."
