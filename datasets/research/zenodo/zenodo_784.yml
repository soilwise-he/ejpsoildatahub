  title: Environmental impact of weathering and soil formation in geomorphological
    research
  abstract: "Weathering is a part of geomorphic processes leading to the disintegration\
    \ and decomposition of rocks and minerals on the earth\u2019s surface as a result\
    \ of physical and chemical action that leads to the formation of soil being a\
    \ most vital natural resource of rock weathering. Development of soils in an environment\
    \ enhances plants dependence on it for growth, and man depends directly or indirectly\
    \ on plants for food, thus the functions of soil as a fundamental interface, providing\
    \ an excellent example of the integration among many parts of the earth system.\
    \ Hence, geomorphology research being based on processes of the earth\u2019s surfacing\
    \ that result into most of the physical features seen on the face of the earth."
