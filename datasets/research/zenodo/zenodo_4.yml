  title: Manure, Soil Organic Matter and Soil Fertility
  abstract: "Higher content of soil organic matter can greatly reduce the difficulties\
    \ of a good crop production system. Content of organic matter in the majority\
    \ of Bulgarian soils is very low which is evident from the results of soil survey\
    \ and the data from mass chemical soil tests \u2013 nearly 60% of studied soils\
    \ are with humus content lower than 2.5%. The organic fertilization has direct\
    \ effect on supplying humic substances in soil. On the basis of some Bulgarian\
    \ soil types, it is shown the inclusion of organic fertilizers into the fraction\
    \ of humic acids. A pot experiment and a small field study with Haplic Chernozems\
    \ show an increase into the fraction of free humic acids and those bound with\
    \ monovalent cations and mobile R2O3 oxides."
