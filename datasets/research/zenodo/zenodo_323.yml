  title: Increasing awareness of soil microbial ecosystem services
  abstract: <strong>Problem</strong><br> All agricultural soils harbour microbiome,
    consisting of a high diversity of bacteria, archaea, fungi and protists. Together
    they provide ecosystem services which are crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and a healthy environment. Agricultural soil management may not deliberately impact
    microbial diversity function, however it may possibly trigger adverse effects,
    e.g. higher production of greenhouse gases, increased levels of soil-borne pathogens
    or inefficient use of fertilisers. <strong>Solution</strong><br> Microbiomes strongly
    respond to environmental changes and management practices such as tillage (till
    versus no-till) and fertilisation. This responsiveness can be used for stirring
    their activities. Farming systems should be managed to promote diverse microbiomes,
    thereby stabilizing microbial ecosystem services. Examples of adapted management
    schemes are described in recommendations. More knowledge on promoting beneficial
    microbiomes should be generated through research.
