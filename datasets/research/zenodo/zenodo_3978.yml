  title: Studies of some physico-chemical properties of soil samples in Vidul, taluka
    Umarked, dist Yavatmal, MS, India
  abstract: The quality of soil depends on the micronutrients present in soil. Soil
    properties that are sensitive to change in the management can be used as indicator.
    The present investigation objectively conducted to analysis the physico-chemical
    properties of soil sample of Vidul village. The five samples were collected from
    different sites of the study area of Vidul in February 2020. The analysis of soil
    was carried out for the study of various parameters like Moisture, pH, EC, Organic
    Carbon, Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous, Magnesium & Calcium. The study revealed
    that all the five samples from selected area of Vidul village are medium to high
    in mineral content, the pH of the soil samples ranged from 7.7 to 8.40 and was
    slightly on alkaline side but within the limit of 6.5-8.5 which is optimum for
    crops. EC values ranged from 0.4ms to 0.7ms. and indicating low salinity status
    of the soils. OC content ranged from 1.30% to 1.64% and all the samples were of
    medium rating. Available nitrogen ranged from 250 kg/ha to 298kg/ha; available
    phosphorous ranged from 20.5kg/ha to 24.0 kg/ha and samples were nitrogen and
    phosphorous deficient. Potassium ranged from 440 kg/ha to 542 kg/ha and samples
    were of medium rating except one sample of high rating with respect to potassium.
