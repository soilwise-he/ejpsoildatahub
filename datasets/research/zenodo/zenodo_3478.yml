  title: Analytical And Statistical Study Of The Parameters Of Expansive Soil
  abstract: The disorders caused by the shrinking-swelling phenomenon are prevalent
    in arid and semi-arid in the presence of swelling clay. This soil has the characteristic
    of changing state under the effect of water solicitation (wetting and drying).
    A set of geotechnical parameters is necessary for the characterization of this
    soil type, such as state parameters, physical and chemical parameters and mechanical
    parameters. Some of these tests are very long and some are very expensive, hence
    the use or methods of predictions. The complexity of this phenomenon and the difficulty
    of its characterization have prompted researchers to use several identification
    parameters in the prediction of swelling potential. This document is an analytical
    and statistical study of geotechnical parameters affecting the potential of swelling
    clays. This work is performing on a database obtained from investigations swelling
    Algerian soil. The obtained observations have helped us to understand the soil
    swelling structure and its behavior.
