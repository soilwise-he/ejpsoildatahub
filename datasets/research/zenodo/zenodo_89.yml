  title: Soil management concepts and carbon sequestration in cropland soils
  abstract: "One of the most important terrestrial pools for carbon (C) storage and\
    \ exchange with atmospheric CO2 is soil organic carbon (SOC). Following the advent\
    \ of large-scale cultivation, this long-term balance was disrupted and increased\
    \ amounts of SOC were exposed to oxidation and loss as atmospheric CO2. The result\
    \ was a dramatic decrease in SOC. If amounts of C entering the soil exceed that\
    \ lost to the atmosphere by oxidation, SOC increases. Such an increase can result\
    \ from practices that include improved: (1) tillage management and cropping systems,\
    \ (2) management to increase amount of land cover, and (3) efficient use of production\
    \ inputs, e.g. nutrients and water. Among the most important contributors is conservation\
    \ tillage (i.e., no-till, ridge-till, and mulch-tillage) whereby higher levels\
    \ of residue cover are maintained than for conventional-tillage. Gains in amount\
    \ of land area under conservation tillage between 1989 and 1998 are encouraging\
    \ because of their contributions to soil and water conservation and for their\
    \ potential to sequester SOC. Other important contributors are crop residue and\
    \ biomass management and fallow reduction. Collectively, tillage management and\
    \ cropping systems in the US are estimated to have the potential to sequester\
    \ 30\u2013105 million metric tons of carbon (MMTC) yr\u22121. Two important examples\
    \ of management strategies whereby land cover is increased include crop rotations\
    \ with winter cover crops and the conservation reserve program (CRP). Such practices\
    \ enhance SOC sequestration by increasing the amount and time during which the\
    \ land is covered by growing plants. Crop rotations, winter cover crops, and the\
    \ CRP combined have the potential to sequester 14\u201329 MMTC yr\u22121. Biomass\
    \ production is increased by efficient use of production inputs. Optimum fertility\
    \ levels and water availability in soils can directly affect quantity of crop\
    \ residues produced for return to the soil and for SOC sequestration. Nutrient\
    \ inputs and supplemental irrigation are estimated to have the potential to sequester\
    \ 11\u201330 MMTC yr\u22121. In the future, it is important to acquire an improved\
    \ understanding of SOC sequestration processes, the ability to make quantitative\
    \ estimates of rates of SOC sequestration, and technology to enhance these rates\
    \ in an energy- and input-efficient manner. Adoption of improved tillage practices\
    \ and cropping systems, increased land cover, and efficient use of nutrient and\
    \ water inputs are examples where such information is necessary."
