  title: Soil fertility augmentation through indigenous tree species in Gummara-Maksegnit
    watershed, North Ethiopia
  abstract: Soil fertility improvement using sole application of artificial fertilizer
    is not commendable due to inaccessibility and financial stress for a farmer living
    in developing countries. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate ability
    of locally available tree species for soil fertility maintenance in Gummara-maksegnit
    watershed, Ethiopia. Questionnaires were administered to a total of 385 respondents
    with aim to determine three topmost preferred tree species for soil fertility
    enhancement. Leaf litter from the selected tree species and soil samples from
    both under the canopy of the selected tree species and open (controlled) area
    was collected for soil chemical properties analysis. Croton macrostachyus, Cordia
    africana and Olea europaea was perceived as to be the best by 42%, 32% and 26%
    of the respondents respectively. Leaf litter of C. macrostachyus, C. africana,
    and O. europaea had significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) nitrogen value. In addition,
    leaf litter of C. macrostachyus and C. africana also showed higher concentration
    of P and K than O. europaea. Soil properties under the canopy of all the selected
    tree species significantly differ (P&lt;0.05) from the open (controlled) sampling
    point mainly because of nutrient addition from the fallen leaf litter to the underneath
    soil. Therefore, it is necessary to advise farmers to let these tree species grow
    on their farms and improve soil condition to achieve maximum production.
