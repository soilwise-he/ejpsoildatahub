  title: Integrating Soil Moisture Measurements Into Pasture Growth Forecasting In
    New Zealand'S Hill Country
  abstract: 'Forecasting pasture growth in hill country landscapes requires information
    about soil water retention characteristics, which will help to quantify both water
    uptake, and its percolation below the root zone. Despite the importance of soil
    moisture data in pasture productivity predictions, current models use low-resolution
    estimates of water input into their soil water balance equations and plant growth
    simulations. As a result, they frequently fail to capture the spatial and temporal
    variability of soil moisture in hill country soils.


    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are promising in-situ measurement systems for monitoring
    soil moisture dynamics with high temporal resolution in agricultural soils. This
    paper presents the deployment of a soil moisture sensing network, utilising WSN
    technology and multi-sensor probes, to monitor soil water changes over a hill
    country farm in the northern Wairarapa region of the North Island. Processed capacitance-based
    raw data was converted to volumetric water content by means of a factory calibration
    function to assess sensor accuracy and to calculate soil water storage within
    the pasture root zone.


    The derived volumetric soil moisture data was examined in terms of its dependence
    on the variability and influences of hill country landscape characteristics such
    as aspect. The integration of spatially distributed sensors and multi-depth soil
    moisture measurements from various hillslope positions showed that slope and aspect
    exerted a significant impact on soil moisture values. Furthermore, considerable
    differences were identified in soil water profile responses to significant rainfall
    events and subsequent soil water redistribution.


    Initial indications are that high-resolution time series of accurate multi-depth
    soil moisture measurements collected by a WSN are valuable for investigating root
    zone water movement. Sensor evaluation and data analysis suggest that these devices
    and their associated datasets are able to contribute to an improved understanding
    of drying and wetting cycles and soil moisture variability. Potentially, this
    will create an opportunity to generate improved pasture growth predictions in
    pastoral hill country environments.'
